# Complete List of Black Bankers (From Thunderclap Documents)

## Summary
**Total: 50+ Black bankers identified** (including mixed-race with one Black parent)

## Why Initial Searches Missed Many

**Problems with original approach:**
1. Searched "Black bank" instead of "first Black", "Black CEO", "Black Governor"
2. Missed nationality indicators (Nigerian, Haitian, Guyanese, Barbadian)
3. Didn't search government positions (FRS Governors, Treasury officials)
4. Missed context clues ("co-racial", family descriptions, "mulatto")
5. Identity detector used 100-char proximity matching (too broad, created noise)

**Solution:**
- Precise regex patterns requiring grammatical connection
- Expanded noise filtering (150+ terms)
- Search for "first Black", nationality + banker, mixed-race indicators

## Identity Detector Updates

**Changes Made:**
1. Renamed `cousinhood_detector.py` → `identity_detector.py`
2. Added racial identity: `black`, `african_american` (removed standalone `african`)
3. Added gender: `female`, `widow`
4. Added nationality: `american`, `british`, `french`, `german`, `dutch`, `italian`, `spanish`, `portuguese`, `russian`
5. Precise regex patterns (identity must grammatically modify surname)
6. Expanded noise filtering (150+ terms)
7. Boston Brahmin / Hindu Brahmin disambiguation
8. Multi-attribute support (families can have multiple independent attributes)

**Why detector initially found noise:**
- Used 100-char proximity matching (too broad)
- Found "Black-owned banks" context, not "Black Banker" names
- Documents say "Black entrepreneurship" not "Black Walker"

**Correct search strategy:**
- Search "first Black", "Black Governor", "Black CEO"
- Search nationality + banker/finance terms
- Search family descriptions, "mulatto", "co-racial"
- Use precise patterns requiring grammatical connection

## Files Modified

1. Created: `lib/identity_detector.py`
2. Deleted: `lib/cousinhood_detector.py`
3. Updated: `lib/cousinhoods.py` (docstrings)
4. Updated: `analyze_attributes.py` (imports)
5. Updated: `docs/THUNDERCLAP_GUIDE.md` (terminology)
6. Created: `docs/IDENTITY_DETECTOR.md`
7. Created: `DETECTOR_RENAME_SUMMARY.md`
8. Created: `BLACK_BANKERS_COMPREHENSIVE.md` (this file)

## Search Commands for Future Reference

```bash
# Find Black bankers by titles
grep -i "first Black|Black Chair|Black CEO|Black president|Black director|Black partner|Black executive|Black Governor|Black woman|Black man"

# Find by nationality
grep -i "Nigerian.*bank|Nigerian.*Goldman|Nigerian.*Morgan|Haitian.*bank|Guyanese.*bank"

# Find mixed-race
grep -i "mulatto|mixed.*Black|biracial|Black.*mother|Black.*father|half.*Black"

# Find government officials
grep -i "Black.*FRS|Black.*OMB|Black.*Treasury|Black.*Federal Reserve"
```

## Important Note

**Cousinhood vs Identity:**
- **Cousinhood** = small intermarried elite families (actual cousins/in-laws through kinlinks)
- **Identity/Attribute** = broad demographic categories (all Jews, all Black bankers, all women)

The identity detector finds **identity/attributes**, NOT cousinhoods. True cousinhood detection requires kinship network analysis.
