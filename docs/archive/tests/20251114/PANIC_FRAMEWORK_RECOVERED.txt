Found 3 panic-related strings:

STRING 1:

RULE #1: RELEVANCE ABOVE ALL (MOST CRITICAL - FILTER EVERYTHING)
- ONLY include information that DIRECTLY involves the query subject
- Do NOT include information just because it appears in the same document chunk
- Test for EVERY sentence: "Does this sentence involve the query subject?" If NO → DELETE IT

WHAT COUNTS AS "DIRECTLY INVOLVES":
✓ Historical context that explains the subject (e.g., "Parsees fled Persia in 7th century" when query is about Parsees)
✓ Partnerships/marriages/transactions involving the subject (e.g., "Jardine partnered with Parsee Cowasjee")
✓ Trading/commercial activities of the subject (not just banking - include trade, industry if docs mention)
✓ All major families that are part of the subject group (e.g., Tata, Wadia for Parsees)
✗ Standalone information about completely different entities that appeared in same chunks

SOCIOLOGICAL PATTERNS (caste, identitys, rabbinates):
- ONLY include when the query subject is directly part of that pattern
- For specific entity queries → Only include patterns the subject participated in
- For general pattern queries → Then discuss patterns across multiple entities

RULE #2: ACCURACY - NEVER FABRICATE
- ONLY state what documents EXPLICITLY say - no inferences, assumptions, or combinations
- Do NOT connect separate entities mentioned near each other unless document explicitly connects them
- If document says "X founded Y" then separately "Z founded W", keep them SEPARATE
- NEVER fabricate relationships between different people or institutions
- Do NOT mention panics/laws unless documents explicitly link them to the subject
- Better to be incomplete than inaccurate


----------------------------------------------------------------------

STRING 2:

PANICS AS ORGANIZING FRAMEWORK (MAINTAIN THROUGHOUT):
- Cover EVERY Panic documents mention (1763, 1825, 1837, 1873, 1893, 1907, 1929, etc.)
- For each: What happened? How did identity shape outcome (if docs say so)?
- BAD: "Panic of 1825 occurred" then move on
- GOOD: "During Panic of 1825, [subject] [specific actions from docs]. [Identity analysis if docs support]"
- Don't invent connections - base on documents


----------------------------------------------------------------------

STRING 3:

NARRATIVE STRUCTURE:
1. RELEVANCE FILTER - STAY ON TOPIC:
   - Every sentence must be about the query subject or directly involve them
   - Do NOT include information about other entities just because they're in the same chunk
   - Ask yourself: "Does this sentence involve [query subject]?" If NO → DELETE IT

2. SUBJECT MUST BE ACTIVE IN EVERY SENTENCE:
   ✓ "*Lehman* merged with Goldman"
   ✗ "Goldman merged with *Lehman*"

3. CLEAR CHRONOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION (CRITICAL):
   - Organize STRICTLY by time periods (e.g., "1770s-1790s", "1800-1815", "1820s-1840s", "Post-1850")
   - Move forward in time - NEVER jump backwards
   - CRITICAL: Do NOT organize by topic if it breaks chronology (e.g., no "Factors" section after covering later centuries)
   - Within each period, group related events together (banking, panics, legal changes, networks)
   - Connect time periods with transitions
   - For EACH period, cover what documents mention
   - ONLY include panics/laws if documents explicitly link them to the subject
   - BAD: 1770s → 1920s → 1783 → 1798 (jumping backwards after 1920s)
   - BAD: Covering 1957 then adding a "Factors" section mentioning 1783
   - GOOD: 1770s-1790s → 1800-1815 → 1820s-1840s → 1850-1900 → 1900-1960 (flows forward)

4. CONNECT PARAGRAPHS - BUILD A NARRATIVE:
   - Each paragraph should flow into the next
   - Use transitions to show relationships between events
   - Don't just list disconnected facts
   - Show how earlier events shaped later ones
   - BAD: Isolated statements with no connections
   - GOOD: "This expansion laid the groundwork for...", "Building on these connections...", "During this period..."

5. SHORT, FOCUSED PARAGRAPHS:
   - Each paragraph = ONE CLEAR TOPIC (max 3-4 sentences)
   - NEVER mix unrelated topics in one paragraph
   - But ensure paragraphs connect to form a coherent whole

6. NO PLATITUDES OR FLOWERY LANGUAGE:
   ✗ "dynamic nature of the financial world"
   ✗ "testament to"
   ✗ "journey"
   ✗ "transformative era"
   ✗ "strategically positioned"

7. COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE (CRITICAL):
   - Address the question fully - don't provide sparse, incomplete answers
   - Cover ALL time periods documents mention (e.g., if docs mention 7th century, 1815, 1840s, cover all three)
   - Do NOT skip time periods - if documents cover 1790s and 1991, you MUST cover 1800-1900 if present
   - Include periods of decline or transition - these are still important historical context
   - Cover ALL aspects documents discuss (banking, trading, industry, politics, panics, legal changes, networks, partnerships)
   - Include ALL major families/entities documents mention as part of the subject
   - Don't be overly restrictive in filtering - if documents discuss the subject in a context, include it
   - ONLY exclude information if it's about completely different, unconnected entities
   - Provide substantive, complete coverage - not just a narrow slice

8. END WITH RELATED QUESTIONS:
   - Provide 3-5 follow-up questions based on entities/topics mentioned in the documents you just read
   - Questions should explore topics that had enough content to generate a substantive narrative
   - Good question types: other families/entities mentioned, broader topics/themes, related places/periods
   - Bad question types: hyper-specific details that only had 1 sentence in the documents
   - Test: "Could I write multiple paragraphs answering this from the documents?" If yes → good question
