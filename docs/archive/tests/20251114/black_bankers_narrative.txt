Congressional acts combine category and year. Holding companies and corporations identified with “HC”. “MM” prefixes identify short-term liquid debt money markets. Names of people are not italicized, but firm names are and do not use definite articles. Some other institutional proper nouns are also italicized. Acronyms are generally not italicized. Descendancy is usually direct. Cousinhood is often of the first order, unless a surname, then usually implies several marriages between the surnamed families. Middle names are either maternal or maiden surnames. Some surnames have been changed for differentiation from others (e.g., Smith to Smyth).

The terminology of panics is imprecise for various reasons. Robert Rubin, reflecting on his experience as Secretary of United States Treasury (“UST”) after co-chairing Goldman Sachs, said that “I avoided using words such as ‘panic’ and ‘meltdown’, preferring less vivid terms such as ‘contagion’ and ‘loss of confidence.’ I’d learned while working in the White House as director of the National Economic Council (NEC) that the words public officials use can make an enormous difference, and that was even truer at the Treasury.” (Rubin, 2003). In the foundational work in quantitative economic history, Conrad and Meyer (1964) observe that: “In much of our literature, the preconceptions about variations in growth rates are obvious in the terminology. 19th century economists spoke

Treasury (“UST”) after co-chairing Goldman Sachs, said that “I avoided using words such as ‘panic’ and ‘meltdown’, preferring less vivid terms such as ‘contagion’ and ‘loss of confidence.’ I’d learned while working in the White House as director of the National Economic Council (NEC) that the words public officials use can make an enormous difference, and that was even truer at the Treasury.” (Rubin, 2003). In the foundational work in quantitative economic history, Conrad and Meyer (1964) observe that: “In much of our literature, the preconceptions about variations in growth rates are obvious in the terminology. 19th century economists spoke of panics and crises. Few people in the ‘30s, however, wrote about the ‘panic of 1929’; by then, the profession had learned that it was studying cycles. Since WWII we have changed our focus once again. We are concerned with the problems of development and sustained growth; we tend to look for ‘breakthroughs’, ‘takeoffs’, and ‘big pushes.’” Does this theory imply that ‘panics’ often occur alongside technological advancements and are of secondary importance to other government objectives? That is probably not the case. There have always been and will always be panics in the financial markets. For example, Allen (1887) chronicles a 33 CE bankruptcy law that collapsed Rome’s money market, which had little to do with technological advance. Panics encompass a range of events, from bank crises to credit crunches, housing busts, and stock market crashes. While the economic cost of panics may increase debt defaults, unemployment, and tax defaults, the impact of economic crises varies. As credit and housing busts can extend recessions, bank panics may destabilize the political order. Given the lack of consensus available immediately on the cause of panics, politicians typically appeal to emotions, rather than facts. The allegories that grow out of panics are the main factors molding political and social systems. It is often easier to blame bankers and politicians. So, voter preferences shift to greater state control after panics. Though production drops are usually short-lived, the cycle of political extremism continues to reshape legislation for a considerably longer period. Several of the seminal studies exploring the causes and consequences of panics include Friedman and Schwartz’s Monetary History (1963), Kindleberger’s Manias, Panics, & Crashes (1975), and Reinhart’s This Time is Different (2011). These works alternately attribute panics to monetary policy, banker greed, or market irrationality. One reason for this is that information about banks only becomes public and interesting enough for the media during panics. But if bad or irrational business decisions are omnipresent, monetary policy is the central factor of panics for otherwise functional markets. According to Friedman in 1963, “Inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon.” And again in 1978, saying “the political establishment tried to prolong the happy glow by attributing the acceleration of inflation to special events—bad weather, food shortages, labor union intransigence, corporate greed, the OPEC cartel, or any straw at which they could grasp.” While monetary policy can contract economies to end inflation, panics often have

Burnham Lambert (“DBL”) to avoid a takeover in 1985, Enron hired McKinsey and supported Texas Senator Phil Gramm. After Reagan appointed Gramm’s wife, Wendy as CFTC Chair in 1987, she exempted OTC derivatives from regulation before joined Enron’s board in 1993. Enron’s lobbying likewise relaxed FERC merger guidelines policies, and other policies to spur energy mergers and create a national gas energy market. Most economic agents are rational in responding to incentives within legal guidelines, particularly for bankers. However, political capitalism is volatile. Legal continuity depends on political control. When the risk minimizing investor fears politics will impact her assets, she will sell them and run to hold safer assets instead. Gun stocks rise after mass shootings since enthusiasts run to purchase firearms while possible. The Soviet Union used this basic human instinct to raise funds by threatening to curb alcohol. Human irrationality is secondary to rational responses. Legal changes rarely make sense outside of legal or historical context. The Modigliani-Miller theorem’s theoretical irrelevance regarding debt and equity suggests that tax instability drives financial innovation. According to Miller (1986), “Were any country actually to leave its tax system unchanged for a generation or so, an equilibrium might emerge... But, of course, we will never know that Nirvana-like state of equilibrium. For a variety of reasons—including especially the desire to blunt the force of previous successful innovations by taxpayers most governments (or, more properly, the shifting coalitions of interest groups using that vehicle for protection and advantage) prefer to keep changing the structure, thereby altering the internal rate differentials and creating new opportunities for financial innovation.” Although complex derivatives typically receive blame for the 1987 stock crash, Securities & Exchange Commission researchers traced the trigger to a Congressional bill limiting leveraged buyouts. New rules empowered Federal Attorney Rudolph Giuliani to combat alleged insider traders. While not quite ‘corrupt’, insider trading (“IT”) is an example of policy flux driven by political capitalism. Manne (1966) described IT as a form of employee compensation and raised questions about its legality even when it does not harm anyone. After many years without an answer, SEC accepted the theory that there is fraud on the market, and that everyone is worse off if trust in the market falls. However, whether that is true or even the proper comparison is unclear. Market volatility has changed little since the securities regulation of the 1930s or 1980s. Indeed, promoting IT may allow those who know most to refocus operations and reduce equity research, accounting, and legal expenses by outside investors. Perhaps the most likely reason for enforcement, as a DBL executive said in 1985, points to profits: ‘[IT is] a real problem... the premature moves in stocks... can screw up deals and cause them to be canceled.” As IT slowed deals, SEC required outsider disclosure until the Court stopped it in 1980. Although IT presented no harm to either sellers or bidders, SEC upheld the public interest principle that investor trust would keep the 1930s from reoccurring. While a

Although IT presented no harm to either sellers or bidders, SEC upheld the public interest principle that investor trust would keep the 1930s from reoccurring. While a viable theory of harm would not be invented until 1988, IT remained legal for policy makers, including members of Congress and FRS, for many decades. But while DBL dominated takeovers in the 1980s, they faced competition from bankers like Lazard and Goldman, where junior bankers also engaged in IT with insider lawyers from Sullivan Cromwell, with outsider investors. While most attorney generals and media outlets could benefit from apprehending culprits, mistakes are not necessarily illegal, and courts often find it challenging to establish fraudulent wrongdoing. The dividing line between acceptable and inexcusable behavior is difficult to define, particularly when it comes to fraud. Even successful attempts to hold wrongdoers accountable, like the prosecutions of trusts and electric utilities in the 1930s or DBL’s Milken and inside traders in the 1980s, ultimately ended with exculpation. Companies may not always follow legislative intentions, but Congress can quickly amend laws to address loopholes and unintended consequences. As private interests often influence public policy, raising questions about the motivations behind different policy approaches. Is it corruption that drives one approach over another? Enron’s political connections, for example, did not shield them from regulators or the ability to offload toxic investments in the Panic of 2001. Despite their political power and dominance of funding LBO takeovers, Milken resigned after aggressively pursuing IT at DBL, precipitating the Panic of 1989. Giuliani became Mayor of New York and the country slid into a recession; the courts exculpated Milken. Likewise, Americans were furious after the Panic of 2007. While the right refused to bail out borrowers, the left demanded appropriation of ill-gotten gains and imprisonment of bankers. Was there dishonesty and fraud in banks in the years before 2007? Did they differ from other periods or industries? Perhaps pay packages attracted sociopaths. However, police departments and politics still attract sociopaths without pay. Keeping greed out of banking concentrates sociopathy in the unregulated sector—private equity and technology—or, worse yet, public policy. While Giuliani secure a pardon for Milken as President Trump’s personal lawyer in 2020, both Giuliani and Trump were indicted in 2023 alleging criminal conspiracy to keep Trump in office. Beyond irony, political capitalism drives policy volatility. Sociology “So long as Isaac of York trusted his brother Jacob of Marseilles”, one historian wrote of Jews of the Middle Ages, “and both of them trusted their cousin Joseph of Jerusalem, all three stood to make a profit.” Like nepotism

While Giuliani secure a pardon for Milken as President Trump’s personal lawyer in 2020, both Giuliani and Trump were indicted in 2023 alleging criminal conspiracy to keep Trump in office. Beyond irony, political capitalism drives policy volatility. Sociology “So long as Isaac of York trusted his brother Jacob of Marseilles”, one historian wrote of Jews of the Middle Ages, “and both of them trusted their cousin Joseph of Jerusalem, all three stood to make a profit.” Like nepotism in private transactions, “crony capitalism” centralizes informal relationships in government dealings can ensure trust and align long term interests. But like fraudsters can exploit trust for greed or to conceal mistakes, so can politicians label informal arrangements as sinister and corrupt. Corruption is a natural result when panics follow policy actions under political bias. The customary understanding of corruption confines it within strict legal definitions, predominantly associating it with the state and public sectors, failing to recognize its broader entrenchment within cultural norms and its pervasive presence across both public and private domains (Rocha et al., 2011). Elites play a significant role in policy making. Traditional perspectives often portray society as a hierarchical pyramid, presenting a straightforward structure with elites perched at the summit and the general populace relegated to the base. This oversimplification disregards the intricate interplay and dynamic nature of social relationships and networks (Woods, 1998). As such relationships are often familial, conventional views similarly cast nepotism in a uniformly negative light, neglecting to acknowledge potential variations between beneficial and detrimental instances (Bellow, 2004). Indeed, Bellow emphasizes the continued prevalence in America of familial traditions and nepotism across different societal spheres such as the military, religious institutions, and labor unions. Unlike the entertainment industry, where celebrities are widely recognized, few voters can readily name current or historical minority bankers and industrialists. “As Ferguson [2010] warns in his introduction, it is hard to write about bankers and financiers. For all their importance, what they do on a day-to-day basis is rarely good raw material for drama except, of course, during crises like the one we have just lived through—and nothing dates faster or reads more dryly than financial coups of previous decades.” (New York Times Book Review, 2010). To avoid perpetuating stereotypes and potential political backlash, authors often omit discussions about the backgrounds of policymakers, financiers, and industrialists. Nevertheless, these omissions lead to incomplete accounts and may obscure the underlying historical context and policy decisions. A gender-focused perspective, for example, sheds light on the unique role of women in finance and investment, differentiating performance from cultural and policy influences. Similarly, examining other minority lenses can enhance our understanding of economic developments, better prepare us for the future, and humanize minority capitalists as an alternative narrative to the rising anti-capitalist sentiments. Throughout history, religions have often bound dominant social groups to the land as serfs or, in regions without cattle,

Similarly, examining other minority lenses can enhance our understanding of economic developments, better prepare us for the future, and humanize minority capitalists as an alternative narrative to the rising anti-capitalist sentiments. Throughout history, religions have often bound dominant social groups to the land as serfs or, in regions without cattle, as slaves. In contrast, ‘minority middlemen’ diasporas, who remained non-conformist, consistently dominated commerce. For example, moneylenders, entertainers, and other roles perceived to be undesirable like have historically been filled by Jews, Christians, and Muslim in Christian, Muslim, and Hindu societies, respectively. But while the Scots, Quakers, and Huguenots had served as minority middlemen for England, they gradually assimilated into the aristocracy, leaving mainly Jews and Asians discriminated. Sowell (2024) noted that inequities are rarely the result of discrimination by dominant groups, noting the prevalence of middlemen bankers, including Greek and Armenians in Ottoman Turkey, Chinese in Malaysia, Germans in Brazil, Lebanese in West Africa, Italians in Argentina, Indians in East Africa, Scots in Britain, Ibos in Nigeria, and Marwaris in India. They maintained their distinct identities through endogamous marriage practices and established close-knit economic and nepotistic social networks that transcended political borders. On the other hand, a lens might produce a bias. By focusing on summarizing the numerous chronicles of great Jews, one might wrongly assume that there were no other competitors or that all Jews lived in the same way. This socio-political marginalization frequently acted as a catalyst for innovation and notably enabled women, particularly widows, to participate in trade and finance. For most European women, this era of ‘equity’ persisted until the emergence of multinational banks and corporations in the 19th century, which limited family competition and excluded women from the business realm for a century. Simultaneously, industrialization accelerated the spread of bonded labor from Africa to Scotland, a point Karl Marx highlighted. Some of his disciples theorized that under Marxism, law would become obsolete. One of the challenges facing capitalism is its ability to resonate with diverse audiences. Some individuals, disillusioned with capitalism, may be drawn to the moralistic simplicity of socialism, while others may exploit the system for personal gain. The co-evolution of gender, race, and religion continues to play a pivotal role in shaping economies. Religious perspectives provide valuable insights into how family lineages historically financed development, often extending credit with guarantees during crises. To safeguard these lines of credit, empires frequently embraced ‘legal pluralism,’ which segregated laws based on geography, ethnicity, or trade. While this approach provided protection for certain groups, it could also expose them to violence, forcing minority communities into undignified trading activities. For centuries, the Emperors of Austria and Russia expelled Jews from specific cities, the approach was often reciprocal rather

While this approach provided protection for certain groups, it could also expose them to violence, forcing minority communities into undignified trading activities. For centuries, the Emperors of Austria and Russia expelled Jews from specific cities, the approach was often reciprocal rather than competitive, promoting other cities to excel in complementary industries. However, even those under the protection of royal patrons with absolute powers, court bankers often faced expulsion or execution when their services were no longer required or death of their benefactors. In many cases, bankers chose public execution over abandoning their faith through conversion. Their lives were just part of their commitment to the public good, others including arranged marriage at young ages for communal benefit, often to distant places without divorce. Frankfurt and other German municipalities protected Jews and often enacted Primogeniture-type laws limited the ability to marry and own property to the eldest, perpetuating socio-economic marginalization within the Jewish community, and incentivizing migration. As Frankfurt restricted marriages to twelve a year, other discriminations against these Protected Jews included higher tax rates than Christians, social and economic exclusion and enclosure in a ghetto, while guilds and local laws limited their career options and pushed them into riskier moneylending and commerce. The Jewish Torah limits the Jewish priestly caste (Kohanim) to descendants of Aaron, Moses’ brother. Aaron’s lineage adopted surnames like Cohen, Kagan, Kahn, Kann, Caen, and Kaplan to denote their connection. The Levites, descendants of Moses’ tribe, supported the Kohanim and used surnames like Landau, Levin, Levi, Levy, Loewe, Epstein, Horowitz, and Segal. Focusing on Russian-speaking Jewish families, Vidgop (2020) compared careers between 1858 and 2001 for three surname groups: rabbinical, occupational, and all others. Even as surnames evolved, occupational biases had persisted for over two centuries. Individuals with rabbinical surnames exhibited a distinct inclination towards professions such as engineering and positions as head/chief officers, particularly in the earlier periods. In contrast, those with occupational surnames showed a consistent tendency to work as laborers. Despite these disparities, the individuals within these groups generally did not identify themselves as distinct, with many bearers of rabbinical surnames remaining unaware of their names’ historical connections to their professions. Beyond the second generation, relationships between fathers and sons or between brothers often struggled. A notable exception is the Rothschild family, who first benefited the simultaneous presence of five brothers across five international financial centers. In the second generation, 14 out of 18 marriages occurred within the Rothschild family, followed by 13 out of 30 in the subsequent generation. According to another estimate, half of the Rothschild family’s 58 weddings were intermarriages over the 19th century were among family members, ensuring the continuation of

According to another estimate, half of the Rothschild family’s 58 weddings were intermarriages over the 19th century were among family members, ensuring the continuation of their inheritance and lineage. Among Rothschild’s earliest agents, including Mendelssohn in Prussia and Frankel and Gunzburg in Russia, and Samuel Phillips in Brazil, Davidzon in San Francisco, Joseph in New York, Wagg, and d’Worms of Ceylon were descendants and in-laws of the Katzenellenbogen (“Katz”) family. One of Judaism’s holiest dynasties, the Kohanim Katz claim descent from King David. Rosenstein (1976) offers valuable this lineage. Unlike most descendances in Judaism and in this book, Katz-descendancy may be a maternal bloodline as even husbands from esteemed religious and banking families often adopted their wives’ Katz surnames. Moreover, not all Katz are Katzenellenbogen. Per Dietz (1907), “Katz, also Cahn and Cohen, originally not the designation for a specific family, but the tribal designation for every priestly family (Katz = Cohen Zedek = the righteous priest), which is why, for example, the priestly families Gans, Spanier, Straus are also called Katz. However, the family that had the fixed family name Katz around 1800 can be traced back to the butcher (Kazef) Salomon Katz, who lived around 1710.” “Katz” in this work usually refer to the major branches of the Katz family. Such descendancy has been ascertained using Neil Rosenstein or a link to Meir Katz, Maharam of Padua using genealogical website Geni.com. References that note uncertain lineage of Katz are possibly Koehn-Zadeks.) While the Katz lineage is well-documented, the strategic nature of their marriages and relationships is often overlooked without proper historical context. Katz-descendants, aside from their financial acumen, also lent credibility to various ventures. For instance, in inter-war Germany, the founder of Danat, Jakob Goldsmith, initially faced rejection by a converted Jewish banker but later secured a contract with Ludwig Katz. However, a 1929 fraud scandal involving Ludwig raised questions about the ‘unlimited trust in management.’ While the Katz family’s influence waned after the Holocaust, some cousins, including Rothschild, Kuhn Loeb (“Kuhn”), and Lazard, continued shaping finance. The Katz also intermarried with families that were regionally powerful. Meyer’s Goudchaux Berr Wolff Marx clan of Nancy (2016) chronicles some of the many Judeo-French politicians and banking families who trace their descendance to four families of Protected Jews allowed to settle in Nancy following the Panic of 1720, including Rothschild, Lazard, and many others. More esteemed than Protected Jews were the Court Jews, particularly descendants of Imperial Court Jews of Habsburg Austria, Samuel Oppenheim and Samson Wertheim.

More esteemed than Protected Jews were the Court Jews, particularly descendants of Imperial Court Jews of Habsburg Austria, Samuel Oppenheim and Samson Wertheim. Like New York Times wedding announcements and obituaries for America in the 20th century, Wachstein (1912) documents family histories from inscriptions in ornate Viennese graves. Although sources are generally scattered, a few compendia help highlight patters (such as Richter (1994) and Stern (1992)). While literate Jews have long compiled genealogies, endogamous marriages play a crucial role universally in building trust networks, shaping skills, and influencing preferential laws. Historical examples of this practice include the descendants of Confucius in China, upper and trading castes in Hindu India, and the descendants of the family of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad in Yemen. Religion tied together social, commercial, and political law. While Islam tolerated usury more than Christianity, it placed greater restrictions on female entrepreneurship compared to Hindu commercial castes. Although Hinduism promoted widows to commit suicide, Islam allowed remarriage. In Shia Islam, daughters could inherit without sons, while egalitarian Sunnis favored male cousins. While Jews, Christians, Japan, and Germany followed primogeniture, Islam, China, Russia, Vietnam, India, and France practiced partible inheritance. After centuries of development, revolution, and cultural cross-pollination, the attitudes of these societies to capitalism remain similar. From the Middle Ages through the 19th century, Christian moral teachings and social hierarchy shaped distrust toward profit-making and lending. Overtime, lending through merchant banking gained acceptance and status due to its ties to elite families and foreign finance. For centuries, Arabian society was structured into distinct clans and castes, with nobility at the apex. Tribal leaders, known as sheikhs, maintained their elevated status by marrying their daughters to sheikhs of other tribes and only accepting marriages from noble families. This practice broke the customary standards of kin and tribal endogamy. Likewise, Polish Historian Marek Minakowski argues that most Poles of peasant descent are unlikely to have Jewish ancestors, as the two groups historically lived alongside rather than integrated with each other, especially due to cultural and legal barriers. Intermarriage was more plausible among the nobility or intelligentsia. From Ottoman Turkey, across the Mediterranean, and in the leading cities of Europe, Sturdza (1999) traces the how the Rodocanachi and their banking cousinhood descended from the ancient kings of Armenia and Greek Byzantine Imperial Palaiologos family. Among Anglo-American financiers and other plutocrats, descent from Emperor Charlemagne appears so common in genealogical records that it can, in many cases, be reasonably assumed after a generation or two of prominence. Arguably more important is the ability to trace this ancestry than its existence. Along with aristocratic

Despite Anna expulsion of Jews in 1727, Isay Liebman remained Court Jew, facilitating the acquisition of diamonds and jewelry for them, managing the finances of Courland under Biron’s trust, transferring diplomatic funds to Poland in 1733 following the death of Augustus II and the War of the Polish Succession against the former King of Poland Stanislaw Leszczyński and his son-in-law, Louis XV of France. When some Jews built a synagogue and converted to Christianity, Tsarina Anna had them executed. However, Isaac petitioned on behalf of the Jewish community to and obtained permission for Jews to live in Saint-Petersburg and Moscow, despite the general prohibition on Jewish residency. In 1734, he became the official supplier to the court and engaged in various financial activities. The same year, she overturned Peter’s primogeniture law of 1714 into partible inheritance, shrinking estates over time. To gain access to the Black Sea, Russia joined with Austria against Turkey from 1735 and put the order of 1727 banishing Jews went into abeyance. In 1738, when the burning at the stake in Saint-Petersburg of a Jew convicted of heresy placed his fellow Jews in jeopardy, Lipman Cohen-Behrens cousin Isay Liebman imported commodities and negotiated with the Austrian treasury to upkeep Russian auxiliary forces. However, with the end of the Turkish war, reactivating the order banishing the Jews. Following Anna’s death, Biron was banished to Siberia. Isaac was not targeted, and he continued his business under regency of the infant Ivan VI. As former Tsar Peter Romanov’s cousin Elizabeth overthrew Ivan and declared herself Tsarina of Russia in 1741, she expelled Isay Liebman and other Jews by 1744, ending the term of Russia’s first and last unbaptized Court Jew. He died shortly after. But Russia’s growing entrepreneurship boosted trade and eased inflation. While Elizabeth removed internal tariffs with Russian Ukraine, trade remained slow due to rapids and a lack of Black Sea ports. Along with turning over state-owned metal works and alcohol monopolies to the gentry, Elizabeth chartered Commercial Bank to fund enterprise and Noble Bank to monetize estates in 1754. However, there were few laws to secure mortgages. While Russia could not access Dutch capital, the British Russia Co reorganized to take advantage. John Cayley, an Anglican descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, joined Russia Co in 1754 after apprenticing with Napier Hassenfeller. Two years later, he married a daughter of Richard Cozens—Tsar Peter shipbuilder—related to the Raike and Gomm families. Through the Wrangham sisters, the Raikes were related to Russia Co’s Wilberforce and Thornton cousins, who also kinterlinked with Smyth in 1756. In Poland, meanwhile, since Radziwill warred with Lords Pac and Lords Potockis and Czartoryski into the 18th century, a largely marriage-based confederation coalesced. Following centuries of civil war, the Radziwills, Sapiehas, and Czartoryskis families inter-married to control plantations and towns. As Maria Radziwill Czartoryski amassed landholdings, she leveraged Court Jews to shape the political and economic landscape. Likewise, the indebted Mikolaj and Barbara Radziwill controlled Berdichev in Polish Ukraine. One of the most prosperous Radziwill cousins

As Maria Radziwill Czartoryski amassed landholdings, she leveraged Court Jews to shape the political and economic landscape. Likewise, the indebted Mikolaj and Barbara Radziwill controlled Berdichev in Polish Ukraine. One of the most prosperous Radziwill cousins inherited the Neswisch estate in Belarus. While excluded from the Baltic grain trade, Jews traded for the benefit of magnates. Across Poland, plantation-owning lords restricted Jewish activities, controlling taxes, settlement rights, economic activities, synagogue organization. While some royal commissioners defended Jewish rights complaints from Christian burghers about Jewish trade practices, the prevailing trend was a growing intrusion of non-Jewish authorities into Jewish communal affairs. Magnate interests prioritized law and order, commerce, and revenue generation, instead of traditional Jewish rights or autonomy. Like the Radziwills and their agents enforced debt collection among Jews, they intervened on the behalf of Jewish merchants against mistreatment from nobles. In-laws of the Radziwill and Katz families aligned across Poland. Since Tatar attacks nearly destroyed the Church-owned town of Opatow of Little Poland in the 16th century, Bishop Teodoryk sold the town in 1514 to a lord. Divided upon the lord’s death in 1532, Opatow was consolidated by Janusz Ostrogski by 1595, becoming second in size and prestige only to the capital, Krakau. As the Lords allowed Jews to settle, 200 wealthy Jewish families soon populated the town, almost all were violently murdered during the Chmielnicki massacres of the 1650s. By the 1700s, ownership of the town passed along his family to Pawel Sanguszko, whose sister wed Karol Radziwill. As Jews resettled, Opatow became one of a dozen cities with over 2,000 Jews by the 1750s. During fairs in Leipzig, Breslau, and Oder, merchants traded German goods with the local small traders on credit. By the 17th century, the Luria cousin Landau family attained prominence in the Council of Four Lands and rabbinates and kahal across at least 20 other communities. Through strategic marital alliances with Katz Wahl, Halpern, Horowitz, and other families, Landau expanded their reach beyond Opatow to Tykocin, Hamburg, and Prague. Through the late 18th century, Katz-Landau descendants dominated Jewish life in Opatow. The life-long kahal member, Judah Landau was also a deputy of the Council of Four Lands. By the 1720s, Jewish merchants dissented against the Landaus’ control over communal life. While Pawel Sanguszko’s comptroller accused Judah Landau of not being accountable for negotiating loans and mismanaging kahal funds, Judah’s brother Isaac violated the rule against consecutive terms and controlled kahal elections, leading to tensions and violence in 1726. As the rabbi, Landau enjoyed a tax exemption, and expanded commercial activities after resigning, prompting the kahal to demand tax payment or cease

Viennese Court bankers depended on Jean-Baptiste Cogels and Pietro Proli. After their deaths, their widows took over their banks. While the bankers worked with Mathias Nettine, treasurer of Duke Francis of Lorraine, soon surpassed them. Duke Francis sought to marry Charles VI’s daughter, Maria-Theresa, France feared Habsburg proximity. So, following the loss of War of the Polish Succession, Francis traded Lorraine to French King Louis XV’s father-in-law Stanislaw Leszczyński in exchange for Tuscany in 1736 and married the heiress. However, after Charles VI died in 1740, Bavaria challenged Maria-Theresa’s claim to the German throne in the War of the Austrian Succession. Joining Bavaria, Prussia annexed Silesia, referring to Breslau as the ‘Pearl in the Prussian Crown.’ Meanwhile, Gentile bankers grew their networks. In 1729, Leendert-Pieter Neufville a linen merchant descended from Calvinists and Mennonites and related to the Coymans family like Pels, started Neufville bank in Amsterdam. Likewise, Swiss Huguenot merchants established trade links across Europe. As Gontard established in Frankfurt, Bagueret started in Warsaw by 1735, merchants like Ami Dumont and François Leclerc conducted trade in Leipzig. In the War of the Austrian Succession, the British soon called on Johann Fries, the Huguenot son of a Mühlhausen mayor, to supply the troops of Austrian, Dutch, British, and Hanoverian troops in the Netherlands and Belgium. Amidst the global war, Britain called upon her trans-national Jewish bankers. In America, Jacob Franks of New York and his son David of Philadelphia served as contractor agents, supplying British forces in Jamaica in 1740. As his sister wed the American-born James Schuyler DeLancey of Huguenot and Dutch heritage, who was New York’s Chief Justice and soon became Lieutenant-Governor, David Franks married Margaret Evans, the Christian daughter of Pennsylvania’s land deed recorder and sheriff. Since his Hart aunt had died in 1736, another of David’s uncles wed another of Moses Hart’s daughters (a niece of the Chief Rabbi of Britain) in 1743. When France conquered Madras in 1746, Franks’ nephew joined Mordecai Hamburger in loans to EIC. Against the occupiers in 1742, Primator of Bohemian rural Jews Wolf Popper safeguarded the treasury Austria. But as Maria-Theresa ceded most of Silesia, she declared herself Queen of Bohemia and expelled Jews from there in 1745, suspecting some had abetted Prussia. That year, Chief Rabbi of Hungary Bernhard Eskeles married Samson Wertheim’s daughter and retired from Moravia to advocate for Jews. Because Maria-Theresa banned Jews from her Court, Bavarian Court Jew Wolf Wertheim connected Court Jews in other countries to seek diplomatic intervention. As Jacob Frankel of Fürth gained support from the Bishop of Bamberg, Britain’s Moses Hart and Aaron Franks convinced King George II to mobilize his ministers, Christian VI of Denmark wrote personally to the Empress, and representatives of Holland, Turkey’s Sultan, the Chief Bishop of Madrid, and the Elector of Mainz appealed to the Vienna. Delaying until 1746, Vienna, Prague, Buda, and other cities expelled Jews, often using violence and plunder. As war ended two years later, Austria readmitted the Jews to restore public finances.

1741, Tobias managed claims for the creditors of the King of Prussia’s government councilor. Several of Boas’ children kinterlinked with Samuel Symons of Amsterdam and one wed Samson Wertheim’s Kann grandson, from a Frankfurt family serving in banking and religious roles in Frankfurt since the 16th century. While active only in Frankfurt, the Kanns branched to the Hague around 1760, forming what became Lissa Kann. For connected Jews, Frankfurt offered respite on the one hand. When Saxon Göttingen expelled her Jews in 1750, Aaron Hirsch-Göttingen fled to Frankfurt to serve as a rabbi assessor. On the other hand, the crowded ghetto was dangerous. After a smallpox epidemic in the Frankfurt ghetto orphaned Mayer Rothschild in 1755, he apprenticed with a relative, the Hanover Court Jew, Samuel Oppenheim’s grandson Wolf Oppenheim. Learning the collectibles trade during this time, Rothschild began selling coins to Prince Wilhelm of Hesse. Unlike Göttingen, Prussian King Frederick II eased barriers on Court & Protected Jew Act of 1750 to promote Prussian industry, like his father did before him. Frederick’s father, King William I, had hired Daniel Jaffe of Poland, a descendant of Rabbi Jaffe, to supply army horses with the right to live in Berlin around 1714. After his son was born in 1722 in Berlin—before adopting the name Daniel Itzig-Jaffe—he became a Protected Jew in 1727. From 1736, Prussia banned foreign silk imports, forcing Court Jews to reinvest minting profits into local industry. As King William demanded more silver from 1733, Gomperz, Frankel, and Ephraim families competed fiercely, as they did elsewhere in Germany. Third cousins with Gomperz from Fürth, two Frankels—second great-nephews of Koppel Frankel and Joseph Goldschmidt—mined, one sister married the Katz-descendant Rabbi Teomin of Breslau and Wilna, and another sister wed her third cousin Veitel Ephraim of Hamburg (whose grandmother was Frankel). By 1742, the Ephraims surpassed competitors. Between Poland and Prussia, Leipzig funneled silver from Polish Lords through bustling fairs in Oder and Breslau to Berlin and Frankfurt. Since the Wulff family was interlinked with the Fürsts of Hamburg, Jeremias Fürst’s son-in-law Gerd Levis gained the favor of Elector of Saxony, becoming Mint Jew of Saxony in 1710 and gaining the rare privilege of residence in Leipzig. For decades, Levis faced opposition from the merchants and nobility of the city council and Saxon Landtag, resulting in multiple expulsions, but each time he was reinstated by the Elector. After Levis’ daughter married a Frankel in 1735, the Ephraims began coining in Leipzig in 1737. When Levis died in 1739, his son Levis Gerd succeeded him, facing opposition from merchants and goldsmiths, but the royal council upheld his position while restricting trade to fairs. Back in 1731, a Teomin Frankel of Berlin descended from Katz, Samuel Oppenheim’s brother, Joseph Goldschmidt, and Lipman Cohen-Behrens, married Simon Bondi, who descended from the Kings of Judah and the delBanco family—thus a cousin to the Warburgs—of Prague. Following Empress Maria-Theresa’s expulsion of the Jews of Prague in 1745, the Bondis fled to the Dresden with Salomon Duschenes.

a Frankel in 1735, the Ephraims began coining in Leipzig in 1737. When Levis died in 1739, his son Levis Gerd succeeded him, facing opposition from merchants and goldsmiths, but the royal council upheld his position while restricting trade to fairs. Back in 1731, a Teomin Frankel of Berlin descended from Katz, Samuel Oppenheim’s brother, Joseph Goldschmidt, and Lipman Cohen-Behrens, married Simon Bondi, who descended from the Kings of Judah and the delBanco family—thus a cousin to the Warburgs—of Prague. Following Empress Maria-Theresa’s expulsion of the Jews of Prague in 1745, the Bondis fled to the Dresden with Salomon Duschenes. While he descended from the Brandeis brother-in-law of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe’s daughter, Duschenes’ cousin Lobl Duschenes, a descendant of Rabbi Lowe, had married Joachim Popper’s sister. As Duschenes obtained a permit to supply Dresden’s mint with Bondi, the soon rivaled Gerd Levis. Meanwhile, the partners’ brother, Katz-in-law Rabbi of Dessau David Frankel, taught his cousin, Katz-descendant Moses Mendelssohn. Born in Dessau in 1729, the short and misshapen Mendelssohn was a prodigy. After David Frankel became Rabbi of Berlin in 1742, a Berlin silk merchant hired Mendelssohn as a tutor and partner 1750. Over this time, Mendelssohn proselytized non-Torah law acceptance to modernize. As one of the Ephraim partners died in 1748 and Frankel left minting, Marianne, third granddaughter of Joseph Goldschmidt, and a descendant of Katz Wulff Court Jews banished from Berlin to Dessau by the Liebmans, married Daniel Itzig-Jaffe. While the war forced Oppenheim and Schiff-in-law Mozes Gomperz to flee creditors in 1750 to Amsterdam, his nephew—an in-law of Ephraim—remained in Prussia. After the Court & Protected Jew Act of 1750, Prussia’s coin contract expired in 1751. So, King Frederick hired Itzig-Jaffe and Ephraim in-laws to supply the stables and act as Breslau’s Mint Jews to connect to Dutch credit. However, relationships with his Gomperz-in-laws resulted in lawsuits and split families in 1755. By then, King Frederick expanded ironworks and mining of Silesia’s coal with reduced taxation and welfare benefits to attract skilled workers. Holding Austria’s tobacco monopoly from 1725, Sephardi Diego Aguilar met Empress Maria-Theresa. Her prejudice was so intense that she communicated with him from behind a screen rather than meeting him face-to-face. After Aguilar’s monopoly ended in 1747, he abruptly left Vienna in 1749 due to Spanish extradition demands, finding refuge in London. In 1751, the central government, municipalities, and officials under the Empress supported Count Blümegen and Baron Neffzern in founding Moravian Loan Bank in Brünn, the first joint-stock private bank in the Habsburg monarchy. In Austrian Bohemia, meanwhile, Israel Popper Hönig, a Sephardi grandson of Wolf Popper, the Primator of Bohemian rural Jews, innovated a tobacco dying process that German traders had kept secret. Having become wealthy during the War of the Austrian Succession, Hönig earned the right to lease the tobacco monopoly in Prague for ten years from 1752. By 1754, the Empress allowed limited Jewish return to Prague. As Prague invited Katz-descendant Rabbi Ezekiel Landau of Opatow from Yampol

a former Ansbach mint official leased the Leipzig mint for a year in 1752 before passing to merchant banker Christian Frege, the son of a Protestant minister from a Saxon village. Frege expanded into the Polish market against the Frankels. During the Seven Years’ War, the Prussian King Frederick seized the mint and transferred control to Prussian Jewish financiers. After resisting but ultimately losing control, Frege fled and became a war contractor supplying Prussia’s enemies. In 1755, the King of Prussia Frederick began transferring control of the mints in Konigsberg, Breslau, Berlin, Magdeburg, Cleve, and Aurich to private enterprise, spurring competing Mint Jews alliances. A faction led by Frankel and Ephraim vied with the group of Gompertz and Itzig-Jaffe. As an early wartime measure, the Prussian state assumed control of the Leipzig mint, where Ephraim began coining alongside Saxon Court Jew Levis Gerd, his in-law through the Frankels, in January 1757. Following the Battle of Kolin—which destabilized Prussian forces in Saxony—Ephraim fled Leipzig. Along with Berlin, Ephraim branched to Amsterdam. After joining that bank as a bookkeeper in 1755, Naphtali Wessely became a manager. Born in Hamburg, Wessely was a grandson of Issachar Rindskopf of Frankfurt and a cousin of the Oppenheim family. In 1760, he established a bank in Copenhagen. Around then, his Rindskopf cousins of Frankfurt—Simon and Beer Nehm Rindskopf—founded Rindskopf bank that quickly gained prominence through partnerships with Frankel of Fürth, Wertheim in Vienna, Halle in Hamburg, Gomperz and Mendes in Amsterdam, and the Symons and Glogau families. Amidst the war, Prussia’s Court & Protected Jew Act of 1750 and Silesian development fostered German collaborations with neutral Amsterdam and Poland, under the rule of Saxon King Augustus III. In 1758, Boas nephew-in-law Simon Symons of Amsterdam married a daughter of Silesian linen merchant Marx Glogau of Oder. Likewise, Samuel Zbytkower, born near Silesian Czestochowa, moved from Oder to Praga outside of Warsaw by 1757, where he married heiresses from Poland and then Breslau. He initially traded thread, ribbons, and yard goods, later expanding into cattle, grain, and other commodities and becoming Warsaw’s only merchant to serve as the King’s Commissaire in 1766. The Catholic Habsburgs of Austrian depended on Vienna’s Huguenot Court Banker Fries during the Seven Years War, who managed French subsidies and loans totaling amounts unknown since Samuel Oppenheim, soon taking charge of commercializing state mines. Fries’ dominance in government finance was attributed to strong foreign connections, particularly with bank houses in the Austrian Netherlands, Dutch, and Italian correspondents. His relationship with the banking house of Widow Nettine of Brussels played a crucial role in Austrian foreign borrowing from 1756. Around 1757, Nettine’s eldest daughter married General Receiver Adrien Walckiers, who was then promoted to Councilor of State and Robe and Grand Bailiff of Termonde. Although both were ‘working’ overtime during this inflationary period, Barbe Nettine maintained her near monopoly of Belgian lotteries and coin mints by thwarting plans for a public note-issuing Belgian bank. Meanwhile, Nettine saw the rise of another female dealmaker, Jeanne-Antoinette

in 1777. Unlike the private banks, the chartered banks Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland used the clause that gave them the option to suspend convertibility of notes into specie—which saved the banks during the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland and the Panic of 1745. Following the uprising, normalcy resumed, and British Linen Co received a charter in 1746 to develop Scottish industry, soon issuing circulating notes to do so. Before the Earl of Breadalbane’s first cousin once removed married the daughter of Colonel David Barclay in 1756, his niece wed James Coutts in 1755, forming Campbell Coutts London. Coutts’ father, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne was a merchant who founded Coutts in Edinburgh in 1723, later becoming the provost of Montrose and Edinburgh. After William Coutts’ death, his sons became partners of Campbell Coutts, which was renamed Coutts following Campbell’s death. His extended cousin, William Forbes of Monymusk, joined Coutts in 1754. For Ireland, Coutts retained Huguenot Touche as her agent. From another family of Scottish clergy and bankers, merchant Robert Arbuthnot married a Forbes and Campbell cousin before moving to Edinburgh in 1762. He partnered with James Guthrie in banking as Arbuthnot Guthrie and served as a British Linen Co director. The Campbells were also related to Drummond by blood and marriage via the Murrays. Henry Murray Drummond partnered with Richard Cox through the Seven Years’ War. Cox, who began as a clerk to Field Marshal John Ligonier, became an agent for the Grenadier Guards and paymaster to the Royal Artillery. With Scottish noble origins and Stewart cousins, Henry married his cousin, Elizabeth Compton, sister of two earls of Northampton, in 1761 and worked with his uncle’s Drummond in London, which started by 1712 and competed with Child and Hoare. Henry was part of a social club of financiers and politicians that included Paymaster to the Forces Richard Rigby, Lord of the Admiralty Thomas Bradshaw, diplomat Sir Robert Murray Keith, financier and Under-Secretary of State Anthony Chamier, and brother of the Duke of Argyll Lord Frederick Campbell. By 1768, Drummond obtained a contract for paying forces in North America with Thomas Harley, son of the 3rd Earl of Oxford and Mortimer. The Glasgow-West Indies elites often inter-married between Scottish colonial merchant bankers and farming Tobacco Lords. Born in Scotland in 1739, Alex Campbell began his Caribbean career in 1754. He worked under family members in Barbados, Saint-Christopher, and Dutch Saint-Eustatius. Between 1753 and 1759, he traded tobacco in Virginia and North Carolina under his uncles’ supervision. Campbell was a partner in an Antiguan trading firm from 1759 and conducted business with British-occupied Martinique. In a related set of strategic marriages, four of West Indies trader John Campbell’s sons married into other West Indies families. Scotland-born Richard Oswald ventured into trade across North America and the Caribbean during the 1730s. By 1741, he became a partner in his cousins’ firm, and later, with substantial profits from the War of the Austrian Succession, he relocated to London in 1746

and Dutch Saint-Eustatius. Between 1753 and 1759, he traded tobacco in Virginia and North Carolina under his uncles’ supervision. Campbell was a partner in an Antiguan trading firm from 1759 and conducted business with British-occupied Martinique. In a related set of strategic marriages, four of West Indies trader John Campbell’s sons married into other West Indies families. Scotland-born Richard Oswald ventured into trade across North America and the Caribbean during the 1730s. By 1741, he became a partner in his cousins’ firm, and later, with substantial profits from the War of the Austrian Succession, he relocated to London in 1746 to trade tobacco, horses, slaves, and sugar. Co-founding Oswald in London in 1748, he bought the slave trading outpost Bance Island off Sierra Leone. Two years later, Oswald married the daughter of a wealthy Jamaica merchant, while his cousin married a Campbell of unknown lineage. He partnered with family and other correspondents from North Carolina to Grenada, Calcutta, and Europe, including Hope in Amsterdam, Lamb in Paris, and Robert Herries. Herries was born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, to Lord William Herries of Halldykes. Robert’s father faced financial difficulties, and his uncle saved the family’s fortune by securing him an apprenticeship in Rotterdam in 1747. With the assistance of Hope, he moved to Barcelona, starting a wine trade business by 1754 and soon expanding to Montpellier, Valencia, and the Mediterranean. After he met John Coutts in Rotterdam, Herries became Managing Partner of Coutts as the older partners aged out, alongside William in 1762. Following a dispute over control with the Coutts family, Herries withdrew from his other ventures, settled in London, and renamed the London firm Herries in 1766, while Forbes oversaw business in Edinburgh. Likewise, Scots entered Georgia, and, by the mid-1760s, controlled commerce in Savannah, Augusta, and Sunbury’s rice trade. In Savannah the leading export houses included Graham, Gordon, and Baillie. Oswald’s correspondent John Graham was identified by the governor to the Board of Trade as personally known to London officials. Operating Gordon in Savannah and Charleston, John Gordon was related to the Drummond, Forbes, and Barclay families and connected to Lord Adam Gordon, who directed capital into East Florida. Robert Baillie’s father and uncle were Edinburgh businessmen. Samuel McCall’s family linked Virginia to Glasgow as his sons engaged in merchant banking and founded the aristocratic Thistle Bank in 1761. His granddaughter married Glasgow banker George Thomson in 1749, whose daughter married Edinburgh banker Alexander Bonar—son of a minister of Perth—in 1786, and together they established Thomson Bonar in London, focusing on the Russian trade. However, as American colonies issued commodity- and land-backed banknotes, Rhode Island’s Redwood and other merchants again complained about inflated banknotes in 1750. While Parliament began regulating and restricting notes in 1751, she allowed bank notes to continue depreciating and legalized payment in British specie over the Seven Years’ War. Following the war, Parliament delegalized the notes in 1763. As the Treaty of Paris ended the Seven Years’ War in 1763 returned Guadeloupe to France, it

However, as American colonies issued commodity- and land-backed banknotes, Rhode Island’s Redwood and other merchants again complained about inflated banknotes in 1750. While Parliament began regulating and restricting notes in 1751, she allowed bank notes to continue depreciating and legalized payment in British specie over the Seven Years’ War. Following the war, Parliament delegalized the notes in 1763. As the Treaty of Paris ended the Seven Years’ War in 1763 returned Guadeloupe to France, it transferred Indes territories to establish British rule in Canada and commercial domination of India by EIC. With the Treaty of Paris, Britain acquired Grenada, Tobago, Saint-Vincent, and Dominica from France, Britain’s first major Caribbean acquisition in a century. Over the next decade, Grenada planters converted French cocoa and coffee estates into sugar cane, building aqueducts, dams, and mills, which made Grenada Britain’s second largest sugar producer. Unlike in the established colonies, planters took on broader roles, including politics and trades, while relying on Scottish financing. A descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, Alexander Campbell did not descend from the Argylls. While his Gordon fifth great aunt married into the family, his descendants kinterlinked with Middleton Campbell. In the 1750s, he worked in Barbados, Saint-Christopher, and Saint-Eustatius in the Virginia and North Carolina tobacco trade to 1759, as a partner in a firm in Antigua to 1762, and in commerce with British-occupied Martinique after 1762. He later engaged in politics and managed estates in Grenada, Tobago, and Saint-Vincent. His nephew established Bartlet Campbell with offices in London, Grenada, Tobago, and the Grenadines. But as Britain passed temporary acts to assist insolvent debtors in 1755, 1761, and in 1765, merchant councils continued to disallow insolvency and bankruptcy statutes passed in colonial Americas. Since the war drastically increased demand for slaves, America switched from importing out of the West Indies to increase direct voyages to the west coast of Africa in search of slaves. After Rhode Island Quakers outlawed the import of slaves after decades of debate in 1761, slavery remained legal for another decade. While Oswald expanded into government contracting during the war, they partnered with Lamb to buy land after, accumulating extensive properties in the Caribbean and North America from 1762. While a cousin-in-law of the first Earl of Breadalbane started Finlay in 1745 and soon traded cotton with Asia and South America, another Campbell cousin-in-law married the son of Irish Catholic banker George Colebrooke. Colebrooke had married the daughter of an Irish planter in the West Indies and partnered with Irish and Scottish financiers, including Nesbitt in London, Cantillon in Paris, and Hope in Amsterdam. Banking increasingly invested not only in trade finance, but also fixed capital for industry. In Scotland, increased labor competition led collieries to enserf coalers using annual non-competition contracts in 1765. Strikes increased London coal prices by a third, but the system remained. Unlike merchant capitalized banks, Scot

century. While Ephraim and Frankels wed in 1777, several of Itzig-Jaffe’s children married those of his wife’s Wulff and Moses Mendelssohn’s Katz branches. As Itzig-Jaffe became a Parnas of Berlin, he funded his son and Mendelssohn in silk businesses. Although Ephraim Berlin closed in 1776, the Ephraims joined Itzig-Jaffe and Mendelssohn in funding the first modern Jewish school in Europe in 1778. Likewise, Itzig-Jaffe funded Mendelssohn’s translation of the Talmud into German with assistance from Ephraim’s Hartwig Wessely. Despite endorsements from Berlin rabbis and Britain’s Hirschel Levin, Orthodox Katz-descendants like rabbis Ezekiel Landau and Raphael Kohen opposed publication in 1780. Since the 1740s, Kohen held rabbinates in Polish Rakov, Vilkomir, Minsk, and Pinsk before becoming Chief Rabbi of the united communities of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbeck in 1777. While Kohen considered excommunication, the King of Denmark’s subscription prevented such action. While Mendelssohn’s Haskalah aimed for modernization and integration through education and reason, Hasidism, led by charismatic mystics like the Baal Shem Tov, focused on spiritual leadership and emotional devotion. Katz descendant Elijah Solomon—the Wilna Gaon, or the Supreme Authority on Jewish law—condemned Hasidism as heretical and excommunicated its followers in Wilna in 1772. This opposition extended from Brody in Austrian Galicia to Mogilev in Russian Belarus. Instead, the Wilna Gaon . Similarly, Rabbi of Prague Ezekiel Landau’s children married into rabbinical families. His son Samuel married the daughter of Rabbi of Lissa, and led the Rabbinical Board in Prague. Landau’s first daughter married Joseph Hatzaddik, a fellow Katz-descendant, who served as rabbi of Vitkow, Sokol, Jaworow, and, ultimately, Posen. Another daughter married a son of Meir Pressburger of Vienna and his wife, a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim and the Mandl Prefects of Hungarian Jews. Since Rabbi Landau sided against the Frankfurt Rabbis in a divorce case, he and his sons were banned from the Frankfurt Rabbinate in 1769. But since Landau had called on Jews to support Austria during the Seven Years’ War, Maria-Theresa created the post of Chief Rabbi of Galicia in 1776 to help organize Polish Jews of Brody, Lemberg, and the rest of Galicia. As Landau declined the lifetime appointment, the position went to merchant Aryeh Bernstein, son of a Frankfurt Parnas and grandson of a Katz Wulff. By 1779, Austria granted free trade zone status to Brody. But as Mendelssohn preached emancipation from the ghettos, parnasim feared assimilation would lead to loss of their special status, Christian Alsatians argued for rights to Jews as individuals, but not a class. While Landau opposed Hasidism, he refused to endorse Mendelssohn’s translation after Berliners began to question rabbinical authority. Landau was also concerned about its use for learning German. Although Mendelssohn intended to remove mistranslations, the German version accelerated the replacement of Hebrew in Germany and the Haskalah. A year after Empress Maria-Theresa’s death, her son and heir Joseph II revoked old Jewish self-rule in 1781, but retained his grandfather’s restrictions on Jewish marriages. As Vienna relaxed restrictions on Jewish bankers—but requiring identifying dress—Primator of Bohemian rural Jews Joachim Popper soon expanded

for rights to Jews as individuals, but not a class. While Landau opposed Hasidism, he refused to endorse Mendelssohn’s translation after Berliners began to question rabbinical authority. Landau was also concerned about its use for learning German. Although Mendelssohn intended to remove mistranslations, the German version accelerated the replacement of Hebrew in Germany and the Haskalah. A year after Empress Maria-Theresa’s death, her son and heir Joseph II revoked old Jewish self-rule in 1781, but retained his grandfather’s restrictions on Jewish marriages. As Vienna relaxed restrictions on Jewish bankers—but requiring identifying dress—Primator of Bohemian rural Jews Joachim Popper soon expanded his bank into Vienna. Within a year, Isaac Arnstein’s grandson Nathan Arnstein, Bernhard Eskeles, and David Wertheim protested collective financial responsibilities. After the act, Popper,, Landau, and the new Primator of Prague Jews Lobl Duschenes—who was Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe’s third-great-grandson, Popper’s brother-in-law, Simon Bondi’s nephew-in-law—agreed to bring the Haskalah to Austrian Jewry, Popper, as the first Prague Jew to reside outside the ghetto, collaborated with Landau and Duschenes to establish Prague’s first modern Jewish German-language school. By 1782, the Emperor issued the Edict of Toleration for Lower Austria’s Jews, promoting religious tolerance and secular education, allowing Jews to earn doctorates in law and medicine. As Jews feared that such education would distract Jewish youth from the Talmud, Wessely published a pamphlet urged Austrian Jews to establish schools. While Court Jews Isaac Orchel of France, Elia Morpurgo of Trieste, and Mendelssohn of Berlin commissioned the transition of Wessely’s works into French, Italian, and German, rabbis including Ezekiel Landau, Joseph Hatzaddik, Wilna Gaon Elijah, and Britain’s David Schiff and Hirschel Levin opposed this work. Opposing both Hasidism and the widespread use of twisted logic to resolve Talmudic contradictions, the Wilna Gaon championed common sense and rigorous textual analysis in religious study—unlike Mendelssohn’s secular approach. Both the Gaon and Mendelssohn had the support of Russian Prince Potemkin’s Court Advisor Joshua Zeitlin. A descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe like Zeitlin and a Katz and Luria cousin, Schneur Zalman of Liady, founded Chabad, emphasizing intellect over emotion in spiritual practice. By 1784, Zalman faced condemnation from opponents in Mogilev. Although Zalman attempted reconciliation, the Gaon refused to meet with him, worsening the divide. Despite these challenges, Hasidism continued to expand into Wilna, Ukraine, and Hungary, gaining control of the Wilna kahal by the early 1800s. While Huguenot Court banker Johann Fries lent to the 1780s, his wealth continued grew until his death 1785. As he faced public resentment, possibly due to his foreign Protestant background, and there were rumors of suicide in response to this backlash. Still, his children continued marrying into royalty, including his son who later took over Fries. Within a year, Lobl Duschenes’ son married Isaac Arnstein’s daughter, and, through her mother, a granddaughter of Merle Schiff Wertheim and Isaac Liebman, and so a cousin of the Pressburgers who kinterlinked with the British Goldsmid family in 1784, ensuring the gold flow between the two empires.

silk trade, while others, such as Qadir Jabiri, secured long-term rights over textile brokerage. Likewise, the ashraf, such as Mamluk judge descendant Kurani and Sufi mystic Kawakibi were exempt from taxes and held political influence. Throughout the century, these elite groups continued to intermarry. Earlier in Turkey, Ottoman forces slew Dahir Omar in battle in 1775 and installed Jezzar Pasha the Wali of Sidon and later Damascus. Born an Orthodox Christian in Turk Bosnia, Jezzar ran away after raping his sister-in-law, and eventually sold himself into slavery. His conversion to Islam soon freed him and he befriended the future Governor of Egypt. While first preferring Orthodox Christian bankers, Jezzar, soon known as the ‘Butcher’ for his methods, grew suspicions about them and appointed Haim Farhi Court Jew of Syrian Sidon and Damascus. By 1776, Farhi’s Gubbay-in-law marry-partnered with David Sassoon, who soon became Nasi of Baghdad. To develop the Galilee, Jezzar offered Farhi and other Jews tax reductions and customs duty benefits. While Christians and Muslims could turn to religious and political leaders, Jews had less recourse. Following a failed Mamluk coup, Jazzar’s paranoia fueled his determination to eliminate Farhi. In 1794, while Jazzar was away in Hejaz, his officers coordinated the imprisonment and torture of Farhi’s family. While Farhi’s uncle met a gruesome death, Haim had his eye gouged out and parts of his nose and ear cut. Despite the horrors he endured, Haim made a comeback. Following Jazzar’s return, he appointed Haim as his economic advisor, allowing Haim to aiding Galilee’s Jewish community. The winds of change blew once again when French General Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Syria in 1799. As the French plundered Armenian monasteries and occupied Gaza, Ramle, and Jaffa, the Muslims of Jerusalem imprisoned 2,000 Christians, suspecting French sympathy. Despite the chaos and uncertainty, Haim remained unwavering in his allegiance to Jazzar, who defeated Napoleon’s occupation forces with British assistance. Since Abu Merak became tyrant of Jerusalem, Christians in Damascus faced heavy taxes, under Abdullah the Ottomans reassigned Jerusalem to Jezzar, who rebelled and expelled Damascus Governor Abdullah Pasha. However, when Jezzar passed away in 1804, Haim found himself imprisoned once more. He was eventually released and entrusted with managing Jazzar’s estate and accounts by his successor. However, Armenian churches continued plagued by problems from Napoleon’s invasion and illicit exactions. While occupying Egypt, Napoleon appointed Ahmad Mahruqi as the shāhbandar, responsible for endorsing French-administered laws. Mahruqi, along with another merchant, served on a permanent council established by the French to convey orders to the city’s inhabitants and address their grievances. He also facilitated communication between the French, other merchants, and the influential court banker of Hejaz. Akin to the ‘Pope’ of Sunni Islam, the Ottoman Sultan maintained control over the lucrative trade routes in Hijaz, including the pilgrimage site of Mecca. Governing Mecca since the 10th century, the Hashemite Sharifs, who claimed descent from Prophet Muhammad’s family, were protected first by the Mamluks and later by the Ottoman Sultanate. Allied since 1744, the Saud family, emirs

before looking east. Meanwhile, Haim’s correspondent and likely in-law, Ezekiel Gubbay, thrived in Turkey. When the Mamluk revolt in Baghdad, Gubbay funded Halet Efendi, who was Sultan’s Mahmud II favorite vizier and connected to the Janissaries, in restoring order and submitting the province to direct Ottoman control in 1810. As a reward, the Sultan appointed Gubbay his personal banker in 1811. As Gubbay became a Court Jew in Constantinople alongside Janissary Paymaster Isaiah Aciman and Chief Tax Collector Isaac Carmona, his brother was appointed nasi in Baghdad in 1817. Gubbay also developed good relations with the Queen Mother. When Armenian bankers lobbied to get the Jews out of the Court, Gubbay convinced the Queen Mother to have three of the Armenians executed. Unlike Aciman, Carmona was first a banker for Esma, sister of the reigning Sultan Mahmud. Carmona inherited the family bank from his grandfather, who had been a textile importer of Salonica who moved to Constantinople, where he established a bank and advised Sultan Selim III, Mahmud’s cousin who was assassinated in 1807. As conditions improved for Jews in Turkey, they worsened in Syria. While Haim was at the zenith of his power, his patron died, and the successor, Abd-Allah Pasha, allowed a servant of Jezzar’s son to assassinate Haim in 1820. Seeking revenge against Abd-Allah, Farhi’s brothers received aid from Carmona. However, their siege failed, and one of them died in the process. Conditions soon deteriorated turned in Turkey too. When Gubbay and Efendi accused the Mint Armenian Artun Kazzaz of irregularities in purchasing gold, the Sultan expelled Kazzaz. However, Carmona convinced him to reconsider. Still, the Court Jew Ibn Rahel brothers continued to oppose Kazzaz. As the reformist movement gained momentum, the Sultan dismissed Efendi before executing him in 1823. As the Sultan secretly created of new Westernized troops, he was convinced that the Court Jews were conspiring with the Janissaries. Confiscating the fortunes of twenty-three Jewish banking families, Mahmud also assassinated Gubbay and Aciman. Kazzaz also convinced him to have the Ibn Rahel brothers executed and Carmona strangled during a family dinner. Upon learning about the new Western troops, the Janissaries revolted. Mahmud declared war on the rebels and ordered cannons to attack their barracks when they refused to surrender. Janissaries that were captured alive, were executed after. To court Christian and French favor, Pasha Muhammad Ali also recruited Armenian banker Yeghiazar from Constantinople. When Yeghiazar passed away in 1825, Muhammad Ali invited Yeghiazar’s nephews, Aleksan and Hagop Missakian, from western Armenia to continue their uncle’s banking activities in Egypt. As Armenians ascended as court financiers and pashas in Constantinople, Syria, and Egypt, Muhammad Ali invaded Syria in 1831 but was expelled from Anatolia in 1832 with British and Russian intervention. In 1833, Ali’s son abolished the special poll tax paid by Christians and Jews and imposed new taxes on all Syrians. While Haim’s brother, Raphael, lost his treasurer position in Damascus, Gubbay-in-law David Sassoon came under a death sentence in Baghdad and fled persecution by

passed away in 1825, Muhammad Ali invited Yeghiazar’s nephews, Aleksan and Hagop Missakian, from western Armenia to continue their uncle’s banking activities in Egypt. As Armenians ascended as court financiers and pashas in Constantinople, Syria, and Egypt, Muhammad Ali invaded Syria in 1831 but was expelled from Anatolia in 1832 with British and Russian intervention. In 1833, Ali’s son abolished the special poll tax paid by Christians and Jews and imposed new taxes on all Syrians. While Haim’s brother, Raphael, lost his treasurer position in Damascus, Gubbay-in-law David Sassoon came under a death sentence in Baghdad and fled persecution by 1833. Elsewhere in the Empire, Jews engaged in less risky commerce. In the Ottoman Empire, the opium trade flourished in cities like Izmir and Constantinople. Izmir, near the opium-producing fields of western Anatolia, served as a primary port for exports. Turkish opium, valued for its quality, reached China and other international markets, despite British attempts to monopolize the trade. While Armenian merchants sourced opium from Muslim peasants in Anatolia in the early 1800s, opium examiners in Izmir were Jews included Bochor Taranto of Rhodes, Ishak Abulafia of Tiberias, and Haim Gubbay of Baghdad. In 1831, the Ottoman government centralized the opium monopoly in Istanbul, appointing Taranto as inspector. By 1843, Taranto kinterlinked with the Crespins, descended of Chief Rabbi of Rhodes Moshe Israel. Leading innovations in opium refinement, the Tarantos soon dominated Constantinople’s opium trade. Abdulmejid became the Ottoman Sultan upon the death of his father Mahmud II in 1839. As Pasha Muhammad Ali set his eyes on Constantinople, Russia worried about access to the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. Amidst the Pasha’s ambitions for independence, Europe sought to prevent his dominance. After an Italian friar and his servant disappeared in Damascus in 1840, the French Consul suspected Jews and arrest a barber who falsely accused prominent merchants under torture. As Raphael Farhi and other Jewish leaders were arrested and tortured, Jewish communities worldwide—along with allies like Thomas Baring—advocated for support, led by Sephardi banker Moses Montefiore of London. By 1840, with the support of Austria, Prussia, and Russia, British warships bombarded Beirut. In exchange for the hereditary rule of Egypt, Muhammad Ali relinquished his control over Syria, Arabia, and the Aegean. Likewise, he abolished land monopolization, rapidly growing transactions. Until WWI, Muhammad Ali and his descendants minted Ottoman coins in Egypt, featuring only the names of their suzerains, the sultans. Starting from 1846, land laws legalized land lets, sales, mortgages, and inheritance. But the government retained the right to expropriate for decades and serfdom continued, as it did along with slavery across Turkey. Also that year, Sultan Abdulmejid proclaimed that Jews would enjoy the same advantages and privileges as others the same year, Raphael Farhi became the senior banker of Damascus and was also appointed to the new provincial council of the empire. Within two years, Sephardi Turks started Valero Bank in Jerusalem. In Syria, the Safras built a banking network trading in gold and currency for the caravan trade.

Lutheran families established trading empires, including Baring, Kleinwort, and Schröder. By 1779, John Baring’s son Francis joined EIC’s board and in 1784 became the first of his family to serve in Parliament. As Francis’ son Alex, trained with Hope in Amsterdam, where his co-apprentice, Pierre Labouchere, the son of a Huguenot clothmaker, married Francis’ daughter. Following the death Joachim Kleinwort, his estate was equally divided per the prevailing law, which his youngest son, Hinrich, used to start importing British goods into Hamburg by 1786 and Amsterdam soon after. Like North German Lutherans, Swiss Huguenots held numerous high offices and engaged in commerce. In the 1730’s, Eschers installed northeast Switzerland’s first hydraulic motor-powered silk spinning mill. Eschers also joined other Swiss families to fund loans for Scandinavians to buy colonies in the West Indies by 1760. After his Huguenot father fled France in 1730 for London and married a Dutch expatriate, their London born son Isaac Panchaud engaged in the Indies trade before moving to Paris in 1763 to bank with cousin in Switzerland. By 1767, Laborde established Caisse d’Escompte with Louis XV’s support to intermediate advances to the King. But as Issac Thellusson’s partner, the Swiss Huguenot Jacques Necker, quarreled with Panchaud about fusing state debt with Indes, Necker convinced France to separate Indes’ commercial and royal functions by 1768, and France abolished Caisse d’Escompte. After reorganizing Indes, Necker utilized Swiss bankers to create a market for Indes debt. By 1772, Panchaud married a deceased Indes official’s daughter. Before dying in 1764, French Court Banker Jean-Paris Montmartel’s heiress and King Louis XV’s mistress Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson financed Pierre DuPont’s essay on landed capitalism. DuPont was born to Anne Monchanin, of a formerly wealthy French family impoverished by their commitment to the Huguenot faith, and Samuel DuPont, a Rouen watchmaker and one of eleven children from a modest home. With Poisson’s blessing, baron-turned-financier Jacques Turgot guided DuPont to the role of editor of the King’s Journal of Agriculture, Commerce, & Finance. By 1771, Turgot became the godfather of Pierre’s son Irénée. And as Louis XVI was crowned King in 1774 with his wife Marie-Antoinette, daughter of the Habsburg Empress Maria-Theresa, Turgot became Controller General of Finances and Pierre became Inspector General of Commerce. While Turgot organized a new Caisse d’Escompte with support from DuPont, he was dismissed in 1776. As Louis XVI sought a Treasury Controller but created a post for Necker due to concern about appointing a foreign Huguenot as Controller General. But while Panchaud formed a new Caisse d’Escompte with Mallet, Lessert, other Huguenots that year, Necker soon evicted him. By 1780, Catholic DuPont became an honorary knight in the Bureau of Finances. As some Huguenot Cazenoves returned to France from Switzerland, others moved to Amsterdam, and James Cazenove emigrated to London, where he wed a French pastor’s daughter. From 1781, Huguenot Dublin-born banker and MP David Touche negotiated to found a national bank. In 1783, Parliament granted Bank of Ireland’s charter, which excluded Catholics and Quakers from the board

due to concern about appointing a foreign Huguenot as Controller General. But while Panchaud formed a new Caisse d’Escompte with Mallet, Lessert, other Huguenots that year, Necker soon evicted him. By 1780, Catholic DuPont became an honorary knight in the Bureau of Finances. As some Huguenot Cazenoves returned to France from Switzerland, others moved to Amsterdam, and James Cazenove emigrated to London, where he wed a French pastor’s daughter. From 1781, Huguenot Dublin-born banker and MP David Touche negotiated to found a national bank. In 1783, Parliament granted Bank of Ireland’s charter, which excluded Catholics and Quakers from the board and was allowed to have more than six shareholders. Touche became the bank’s Governor, and his brothers joined as directors. As his cousin William returned from EIC service, he married the daughter of co-religionist London banker John Puget, who became Bank of Ireland’s London correspondent. Refining gold from the 1750s, Puget transferred Irish Treasury Bills for Bank of Ireland and became Governor of BOE from 1790. Like the Haskalah spread for Jews in German lands, the power of the Catholic Church waned in France, promoting secularization from the 1760s, and decreasing family sizes against Church doctrine. France followed Germany in limiting the autonomy of Jewish courts in 1777. As false receipts flooded Jewish loans in Alsace amidst anti-Jewish propaganda, Cerf Berr sought Moses Mendelssohn’s aid. To bridge Christian and Jewish perspectives, Mendelssohn enlisted Christian Wilhelm Dohm to advocate for Jewish civil rights in a 1781 pamphlet. Despite limited distribution in France, ideas of emancipation from the ghettos spread. But that same year, without Jewish Courts, Rabbi Lehmann outbid Cerf Berr for an army delivery contract. As the bidding war attracted a Gentile, both Jews lost the contract. While Berr’s brother-in-law Rabbi Sinzheim excommunicated Lehmann, Frankfurt’s rabbinical college intervened and lifted the ban in favor of Lehmann. Likewise, Berr’s agent Isaac Orchel, tobacco manufacturing banker of Nancy, promoted assimilation and refuted the conflict between religious and civic duties, commissioning the transition of Hattwig Wessely’s Haskalah works into French by 1782. Although Dutch Christian banks continued to discriminate again Jews in their large state loans issued to Poland and other governments, Boas became the sole Dutch Jewish state financier. Starting in 1780, they lent to Gustav III of Sweden. In 1781, Boas loaned 1,000,000 florins to Habsburg Emperor Joseph II. Between 1781 and 1786, they loaned over 500,000 florins to the Prince of Waldeck. They also loaned 200,000 florins to Hessen-Homburg, 450,000 florins to Nuremberg, 350,000 florins to British Princes, and 2,000,000 florins to Liège. Additionally, Boas managed debts for Copenhagen’s Royal Exchange Bank, the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, and the Duke of Brunswick, extending financial support to these entities during this period. By 1781, Anglo-Dutch Levi Cohen-Barent became London’s leading trader of Brazilian diamonds, that he consigned to Hope. That year, Barent-Coehn’s Boas descendant niece married Mozes Nijmegen Ezechiels—a brother-in-law of Abraham Goldsmid through the Vries family—who founded Ezechiels in Rotterdam that year. Since Abraham’s father Aaron Goldsmid arrived in London in

Robert Herries and his countryman Walter Boyd. Particulière invested in Nettine, which contracted a ship for the Angola slave trade. Establishing Belgium Assurance in 1782, Particulière expanded to Brussels, Ostend, Ghent, and Bruges by 1783. Walckiers became the Belgian Receiver General of Finance in 1784 and worked with Ezechiels of Rotterdam for two years. After briefly serving in Parliament, Herries expanded into colonial maritime insurance and privateering with Herries Keith out of Ostend. In 1784, Herries appointed his brother to lead Herries, with James Drummond joining as a partner. Within a year, Herries became London intermediary and maritime insurer for Indes. For tobacco contracts, Herries collaborated with Boyd Ker as Boyd split to co-found a Parisian correspondent. Working with Hope and Baring, Boyd Ker failed to monopolize cochineal dye in 1787. Along with servicing American Minister Thomas Jefferson, Boyd Ker acted as Herries’ agent in bidding for a contract to supply Virginia tobacco to France. Along with holding Indes stock, Lamb Head Jean Lamb became a director of Caisse d’Escompte until selling Lamb to a Dutch refugee banker. Likewise, Swiss Huguenot bankers returned to Paris to fund Indes and other trade. Among the oldest was started by the Rougemonts, who received the hereditary viscountship of Besançon in 1030, where they produced three archbishops and were granted nobility in 1683. Since trader François Rougemont declined Prussian ennoblement, his son Jean-Jacques founded a Parisian banking house. As Rougemont partnered with Jean-Conrad Hottinguer to form Rougemont Hottinguer with several other patricians, they hired Henri Escher, whose father formed a bank by 1787. But although Louis XVI allowed Huguenots to live in France, follow any profession, and marry before civil justices, the French Treasury dwindled. As Swiss bankruptcies spread, Jean Escher shuttered his bank and joined the Russian military. At the same time, Russian Court Banker Friedrichs organized more loans from DeSmeth, driven partly by the political unrest in Holland and unsuccessful attempts to secure loans from Britain. By 1783, Catherine awarded Ukrainian Moshe Pernas—possibly a Sephardi shipbuilder—with the surname Rafalovich. His descendants dominated Russian grain. British merchant bankers, such as the evangelical Anglican Thornton, also lived in Russia and kinterlinked with descendants of Tsar Peter’s English shipbuilders, Wilberforce Baltic traders, and Smyth bankers. By 1784, the cousins established Baltic merchants Wilberforce Smyth. (As a Thornton wed a metal merchant’s daughter, a Smyth married merchant William Manning, the son of a Saint-Kitts planter who settled in London in the 1760s. William’s sister had married Huguenot slave trader Henry Laurens’ son, Oswald’s partner in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1776.) Grigory Potemkin was born in a village near Smolensk. His family owned a modest estate with 430 male serfs and claimed descent from Italian and Dalmatian princes. Catherine II noticed Potemkin for his wit in 1762 and made him her lover during her rise to power. After their affair ended, he remained her trusted advisor and de facto co-ruler. Potemkin founded the Black Sea Fleet and the cities of Sebastopol and Odessa, annexed Crimea, and led

settled in London in the 1760s. William’s sister had married Huguenot slave trader Henry Laurens’ son, Oswald’s partner in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1776.) Grigory Potemkin was born in a village near Smolensk. His family owned a modest estate with 430 male serfs and claimed descent from Italian and Dalmatian princes. Catherine II noticed Potemkin for his wit in 1762 and made him her lover during her rise to power. After their affair ended, he remained her trusted advisor and de facto co-ruler. Potemkin founded the Black Sea Fleet and the cities of Sebastopol and Odessa, annexed Crimea, and led Russia to victory in the Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774). In 1772, the First Partition of Poland incorporated approximately 45,000 Jews into the Russian Empire. In 1776, Tsarina Catherine awarded the Krichev district to Prince Potemkin and granted the Shklov district to another lover, General Semion Zorich. Both men managed these estates and interacted with local Jews. Inviting Jewish settlers to move to southern Russia, Potemkin permitted Jews to settle in areas left vacant by the Cossacks in 1777, provided they brought Gentile Poles and invested capital. Potemkin offered them seven years of tax exemption, permission to trade in wines and spirits, and protection from soldiers. From 1780, Russia opened fifteen note-issuing branch banks, mainly in newly annexed areas. More generally, Russia sought to economically integrate Jews, allowing them to engage banking and trade with the same taxes as Christians. As his brother became Zorich’s import-export agent in Riga, Shklov-born Joshua Zeitlin, a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, managed Potemkin’s, organized military supplies, and ran the mint at Kaffa in Crimea. Zeitlin, who frequently traveled with Potemkin, was made a Court Advisor, thereby allowing him to be a noble status and own the Mordvinov estates with 910 serfs. A promoter of Haskalah against Hasidism, Zeitlin maintained connections with the Wilna Gaon and Moses Mendelssohn, and his daughter married the Chief Rabbi of Berlin’s Katz-descendant nephew, Abram Peretz. Zorich’s contractor Mogilev-born merchant Natan Nota served Polish Lords before moving to Shklov and supplying Potemkin. Later serving Zorich, Nota wed the daughter of the Katz-descendant Rabbi of Metz. For international finance, Prince Potemkin depended upon Richard Sutherland, a third generation Russian-Scot shipbuilder affiliated with Russia Co, was instrumental in managing finances. Sutherland facilitated significant financial transactions, including arranging a loan in 1784 to support Potemkin’s colonization efforts of Mennonites from Danzig to New Russia. He also funded infrastructure, such as the construction of the town of Ekaterinoslav. Throughout their financial dealings, Sutherland faced challenges due to Potemkin’s erratic borrowing patterns and frequent defaults. By 1784, Russia Catherine annexed the Crimea of the Ottoman-allied Giray Khanate. With the death of Friedrichs, Tsarina Catherine appointed Sutherland the Court Banker. While Russia consolidated her note issuing banks and printed more notes, rumors about Sutherland spread in 1786, leading DeSmeth and other banks to decline his drafts. Although Russian initially negotiated with the Dutch and Danish for troop transport ships, British Thornton became the primary

Booker Washington—and founded Johnson Publishing a year later. While America courted decolonized nations, New Deal institutions from TVA to TBTA discriminated against Black labor, credit, and housing. Unlike Robert Moses, TVA’s David Lilienthal was less racist than Tennessee. So did federally regulated cartels—such as ICC’s trucking certificates—by favoring political patronage over market competition. As unions proliferated after 1937, White unions sought Black support to prevent Blacks from becoming strike-breakers. Ceasing cheap labor practices Black union workers grew from 56,000 in 1930 to 600,000 by 1940 and 1,250,000 during WWII. Like the members of labor unions, leaders themselves spurred dynasties, included the Reuther brothers of UAW, John Lewis and his family in the United Mine Workers, and so on. However, majority-Black and Hispanic roles remained un-unionized and under-paid. TransAmerica was one of the few to service migrant farmworkers. By 1947, GE chaired Truman’s Civil Rights Committee. Likewise, Truman appointed Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer in 1949 in appreciation for her campaigning in Republican Kansas. While the UST Secretary post continued to be held exclusively by White men for decades, the Treasurer role was reserved for women and focused on promoting economic development in underprivileged areas. Ralph Bunche, graduating from UCLA in 1927, earned a PhD from Harvard, and became Chair of Political Science at Howard. By 1950, he became the first Black to win the Nobel Peace Prize for his mediation efforts in Israel. Bunche also made history as the first Black appointed to Harvard’s Faculty of Arts & Sciences and served as an Overseer starting from 1959. By 1951, the number of Blacks in high-trust positions ranging from banks managers to board directors, particularly in New York City and Los Angeles, grew to nearly 500, with over half in Manhattan and sixteen in TransAmerica on the West Coast. In Africa, skin color and gender were less important than culture. While West African markets continued to explicitly ban the sale of human flesh, Yoruba women gained wealth and status through their business acumen in trade. Some held capital exceeding £20,000, with one woman’s annual turnover with a major European trading firm reaching six figures. Other women secured credit lines for $9,000 of American tobacco. (In 1961, Governor Rockefeller’s son Michael disappeared while exploring Guinea’s Asmat region. Through the family attributed death to drowning, stories that the actual cause was cannibalism continued for decades.) Although western women had been relegated to homemaking, they soon became entered the labor market in force. Austro-Hungarian Jews deserve special mention. Hedwig Kiesler, born in Vienna to a Wiener manager (and possible Katz-descendant), fled to America in the 1930s, where she thrived in Hollywood as Hedy LaMarr and innovated radio signals. Around the same time, Josephine Mentzer, the niece of a Hungarian chemist, marketed face creams at Saks 5th Ave as Estée Lauder, which she later incorporated. And George Rosenkranz, who fled Nazism to Mexico, helped invent birth control. After five years of safety trails, his company, Syntex, faced difficulty getting to market because of opposition from

expertise. Since Lehman actively opposed another natural gas bill in 1956, concerned about its impact on consumer costs and profits for gas companies, President Eisenhower vetoed the bill and FPC trapped gas in the Southwest. So America and her bankers looked to Canada. After diversifying Seagram from whiskey into other spirts in the 1940s, President Samuel Bronfman invested in the Alberta oil company Royalite by 1950. After selling his interest in Gulf Oil and buying Frankfort Oil, Seagram acquired Texas Pacific Coal & Oil in 1963, subsequently merging Frankfort and Texas Pacific to form Texas Pacific Oil. By this time, Loeb became a major securities financier. After Carl Loeb married Adeline Moses and took over Metallgesellschaft America during WWI to form AMAX, his son married a Lehman in the 1920s, gaining in-laws at Kuhn and other banks. Carl sold his interests at the height of 1929 to start Loeb. Before Carl’s sons took over after he died in 1955, his daughter married Samuel Bronfman’s son in 1953. The same year, Samuel Bronfman’s daughter of married Katz-descendant Alain Gunzburg, who had graduated Harvard who inherited management of Louis-Hirsch in Paris. By 1957, Samuel Bronfman stepped aside, and his son Charles became Seagram President, marrying the granddaughter of former Speyer and Lazard New York partner Paul Baerwald by 1962. Bronfman was then appointed to Bank of Montreal’s board. Moreover, Samuel Bronfman also helped Meyer develop a protégé. The Vienna-born Katz-descendant and grandson of a Vienna banker, Felix Rohatyn fled to France with his mother on false papers, where his stepfather met Katz-descendant André Meyer. But as free France fell Felix traveled to Oran, Casablanca, Lisbon, and Rio de Janeiro before arriving in New York at fourteen in 1942. After graduating Middlebury College in 1949, Rohatyn took a job at Lazard New York per his stepfather’s connection. Content as a FX specialist initially, Rohatyn shifted to mergers and corporate finance after Seagram President Samuel Bronfman advised him that was the only way to impress Meyer. Despite Meyer’s initial skepticism, Rohatyn committed to business school at night, taking a one-third salary cut. He became Meyer’s protégé, handling major deals in mergers and corporate finance. Likewise, Lehman hired rabbinical descendants. Eli Blachowitz “Black” born in Lublin, Poland, came from a long line of rabbis. His father was the first in the family to leave post-WWI Poland to New York in 1920s. Black graduated from Yeshiva Uni in 1940 and became a rabbi in Long Island. Discontent with his role, he transitioned into business, joining Lehman in 1946 and later American Securities Corp. In 1954, he became Chair and CEO of American Seal-Kap. High energy prices also incentivized Rockefeller-, Stone Webster-, and Boston Brahmin-affiliated White Weld and Montreal’s Nesbitt, which controlled Canadian Power, and banked British Columbia Power, Canada Steamships Lines, Canadian Celanese, Bathurst Power & Paper, and Canadian Oil by 1940.

In 1957, Nesbitt issued debt for Trans-Canada Pipelines to pipe natural gas from Alberta to Montreal. Nesbitt coordinated with New York investment bank White Weld, advising a deal with Tennessee Gas Transmission and her subsidiary Midwestern Gas Transmission. White Weld also organized LIC financing while Lehman led another group with an option to buy Quebec’s gas assets. Through years of regulatory uncertainty until FTC and Canadian regulators approved gas exports to America by 1960, Nesbitt continued floating issues and senior partners soon joined Trans-Canada’s board. Amidst dumping allegations, Japan textiles cartelized in 1957. Also that year, the Treaty of Rome replaced ECSC with the European Economic Community (“EEC”) to reducing barriers to trade and increasing competition. At the same time, created Euratom for a single market for nuclear materials and technology. The new regime allowed the three regional Deutsche banks to re-merge into Deutsche, with Abs at the helm. But as Europe grew closer, her colonies broke apart. While Indonesia nationalized Shell’s oil, the Soviets aided Egypt, bauxite-rich Ghana, and others following the Sinai War and recession. After Ghana supported democracy, Congress and Israel financed her. So, Eisenhower promoted Dillon under the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs to unify foreign aid policies and to re-negotiate the General Agreement on Tariffs & Trade (“GATT”). Moreover, Congress promoted North American trade with import quotas on overseas oil, subsidizing independent refiners at the cost of integrated majors in 1959. As America paid above market prices, Saudi Arabia cartelized producers into Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”). With the decline of the British Empire and rationalization of British companies, Mercantile Bank and British Bank of the Middle East (“BBME”) were insolvent. Since acquiring P&O Bank before WWII, HSBC’s main rival, Chartered Bank, added the Eastern Bank and the Cyprus branches of Ionian Bank in 1957. HSBC became the largest foreign bank in many countries from the Far East to Southwest Asia as she invested in BBME and reconnected with Morgan Grenfell by acquiring Mercantile Bank in 1959, which had strong connections to Yule Catto. When acquiring BBME, HSBC asked Sassoon-cousin Lawrence Kadoorie to resign as a Director due to his being Jewish. As head of Chase International Ventures since 1958, Meyer co-founded Iran Development Bank with former-Chase VP and Chair of BANK Eugene Black Jr, followed by similar ventures in South Africa by 1960 as Citi, Morgan, and other American commercial banks branched overseas.

she established a large interest in BBME and renewed her connection with Morgan Grenfell by acquiring Mercantile Bank in 1959, which had strong connections to Yule Catto. When acquiring BBME, HSBC asked Sassoon-cousin Lawrence Kadoorie to resign as a Director due to his being Jewish. As head of Chase International Ventures since 1958, Meyer co-founded Iran Development Bank with former-Chase VP and Chair of BANK Eugene Black Jr, followed by similar ventures in South Africa by 1960 as Citi, Morgan, and other American commercial banks branched overseas. In British East Africa, meanwhile, marriage united disparate ethnicities and politics. Since migrating into Kiambu during the 19th century, Kikuyu families claimed land by clearing and cultivating it, often negotiating with the indigenous Wandorobo. Some Kikuyu families established large estates, including Magana in Ngenda. One of Magana’s wives was a Maasai, and his daughter married a Maasai chief, with whom Magana’s grandson, Jomo “Kenyatta” Ngengi, spent time. Kenyatta joined Kikuyu Central Association (“KCA”), he moved to London to lobby the British government regarding Kikuyu land grievances in 1929. Although married, he moved to London, later marrying Edna Clarke, a White Briton, in 1942. After the colonial government suppressed KCA, the ethnically diverse Kenya African Union (“KAU”) emerged, which Kenyatta joined upon his return to Kenya in 1946. He strengthened ties with Kikuyu elites by marrying the daughter of Senior Chief Koinange. Following her death, he married the aristocratic daughter of Chief Muhoho. As the Mau Mau Uprising against British land policies escalated, Kenyatta’s leadership came under scrutiny while radicals took over Kikuyu politics, and assassinated Senior Chief Waruhiu Kungu. While Evelyn Baring governed British South Africa since the 1940s, he became Governor of Kenya following the murder. With Kenyatta convicted and imprisoned, the escalating violence, Baring declared a state of emergency and appointed General George Erskine to lead military operations in East Africa. To address land policies, Baring focused on economic agricultural development and fostered Black farmers. Since America’s State Department pressured Bolivia to limit German influence in its oil and tin industries during WWII, Bolivia’s Revolutionary Nationalist Movement formed in 1942 to represent working-class and indigenous interests. Despite winning elections in 1951, military intervention led to the armed rebellion in 1952, followed by the expropriation and nationalization of tin mining, and agrarian reform by 1953. The fervor infected Chile, where former military dictator Carlos Ibáñez capitalized on anti-party sentiment, emphasizing his ability to address corruption and economic crises. Amidst Chilean hyperinflation in 1955, former Morgan Paris apprentice Augustin Edwards IV influenced the Chilean government to engage America’s former Assistant Secretary of Commerce. Along with reducing copper profit taxes, Edwards commissioned a study to reform Chile’s financial system. The resulting reforms stabilized the currency and spurred growth by 1956. While Bank of Syria & Lebanon oversaw finances since 1924, Lebanon’s separation in 1948 split the bank and currency. As Syria formed Central Bank of Syria, a currency board took over Lebanon’s currency. As Syria, enduring two military coups in 1949, Adib Shishakli orchestrated

to Jordan by 1957, and started his career at Phillips Petroleum, becoming President of Phillips Algeria by 1963 and subsequently COO of Phillips Middle East. During those years, Munib established an oil and gas engineering services company in Jordan that later became EDGO and, like his cousins, became close with PLO Chair Yasser Arafat. Likewise, Hikmat’s brother Sabih moved to Saudi Arabia, where he became close to the ruling family and started Arab Supply & Trading Corp (“ASTRA”) in 1967, soon becoming the food caterer of the Saudi military. As more decolonized nations embraced Marxism, Communists seized control of Belgian Congo in 1965, Mobutu Sese Seko declared a new government and established the single-party rule in 1967. Enforcing Africanization and renaming the country Zaire, Mobutu later aligned with Maoist China and consolidated power through state patronage and suppressed dissent and Communism. Through Africa, Soviet ideals spread to America. Malcolm X closely observed the spread of Marxism and decolonization, and he called on African Americans not to align themselves solely with White liberals. As Black grassroots organizers planned a radical protest in DC in 1963, the Kennedy Administration sought to moderate it. Working with Taconic Foundation—led by Andrew Mellon’s granddaughter, her Warburg-related Prue husband, and their attorney founder of Paul Weiss—directed funds to NAACP, Urban League, and other civil rights groups willing to coordinate with federal officials, leading Malcolm X to accuse them of emasculation. Instead, he urged them to identify with other oppressed people. Malcolm believed in elevating the struggle for Black freedom to an international level, aligning with movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America against ‘American neocolonialism.’ In addition to advocating for a rejection of capitalism, Malcolm X converted to Islam and drew attention to the plight of Palestinians starting in the late 1950s. He visited Gaza refugee camps months before his assassination in 1965. After North Rhodesia gained independence from Britain as Black-led Zambia by 1965, Southern Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence as White-led Rhodesia under PM Ian Smith. UN’s Security Council authorized Britain’s Royal Navy to prevent oil from South Africa from reaching apartheid Rhodesia via Mozambique from 1966. Through this time, Ethel Katz continued to shape public opinion against apartheid. Engaging in underground work for ANC and aiding activists’ escape from the country, Katz became executive secretary of Anti-Apartheid Movement in 1967, and masterminded campaigns to reshape Labour Party policy to align with the southern African liberation movements. Organizing protests during the Springbok rugby tour of 1969, Ethel’s efforts blocked arm sales to Ian Smith’s apartheid regime in Rhodesia. That year, Smith updated the Land Apportionment Act of 1930, reduced national parks lands by 33% to increase the land allocated to the Black majority by 2%, while maintaining most of the land for the European White minority. Over the same time, former British imperial banks consolidated.

liberation movements. Organizing protests during the Springbok rugby tour of 1969, Ethel’s efforts blocked arm sales to Ian Smith’s apartheid regime in Rhodesia. That year, Smith updated the Land Apportionment Act of 1930, reduced national parks lands by 33% to increase the land allocated to the Black majority by 2%, while maintaining most of the land for the European White minority. Over the same time, former British imperial banks consolidated. After Africa-focused Standard acquired BBWA in 1965, HSBC’s rival East Asia-focused Chartered Bank broke her Africa-sharing contract with Chase, merging with Standard in 1969. In the gold capital of the Middle East, Lebanon’s largest banker, Yusuf Beidas of Intra, did not have the close ties to the state of the rival political banker oligarchy. So, amidst the Panic of 1966, the new Central Bank of Lebanon withheld liquidity from Intra. As accusations of fraud were levied against Intra’s board, New York regulators seized Intra New York for receivership, but Bank of America and Chase refused to hand over deposits. Weeks after graduating Harvard Business and joining Kidder, Roger Tamraz, convinced Chair Albert Gordon to invest in Intra by 1967. As small depositors received refunds, the New York branch entered receivership and was sold. Following this, assets were allocated among Intra and Marchek Bank, the JV of Morgan and Lebanese financiers. Soon after reorganizing Intra, Kidder facilitated a bond issue for EgyptAir. While Fouad Chehab became Governor of Central Bank of Lebanon from 1966 until becoming President of Lebanon in 1976, the son of Michel Chiha’s sister and former President Khouri served as Governor of Central Bank of Lebanon from 1977 to 1984 and 1991 to 1994. Likewise, Sunni banker Salim Hoss chaired the Banking Control Commission from 1967 to 1976 and served as PM of Lebanon four times between 1976 and 2000. Likewise, the Soviet Union remained committed to Lebanon. Since joining Vneshtorg in 1962, Viktor Gerashchenko moved to Narodny London in 1965, and to Narodny Beirut by 1967. Since Narodny London left the gold market in 1965, Narodny Zurich opened in 1966, allowing the Soviets to buy gold from Switzerland instead. Soon establishing a Tehran branch, Narodny sought to branch to Tokyo. Meanwhile, Islamist radicalism increasingly spread in Northern Nigeria against Westernization and the Christian South. In 1962, Kano authorities deported Muhammadu Marwa for his anti-establishment activities. Despite preaching Islam, Marwa used charms and amulets, including human body parts, and was imprisoned in 1973 for inciting violence. Instead of reforming him, these events made Marwa and his followers more defiant, leading to further legal clashes. Similarly, in Bedde, a man named Yusuf rejected Western education. The Bedde Emirate gained prominence in 1825 after colonization by the Muslim Bade tribe, originally from the Kanem and Lake Chad region, ruled by the Dugum dynasty since then and continued under British governance. In 1945, Umar Suleiman, educated in both Western and Islamic traditions, inherited the emirate. Although he banished Yusuf in the 1960s, Yusuf’s son, Mohammed, continued his father’s activities and formed

In 1945, Umar Suleiman, educated in both Western and Islamic traditions, inherited the emirate. Although he banished Yusuf in the 1960s, Yusuf’s son, Mohammed, continued his father’s activities and formed Boko Haram in the early 2000s. Despite rejecting Western education and technology, Mohammed Yusuf continued to use mobile phones and cars, reflecting the hypocrisy of Marwa. Amidst the riots, a faction of military officers initiated a coup against Nigeria’s corrupt and nepotistic politicians in early 1966. This coup resulted in the deaths of key political figures from Nigeria’s inaugural republic, including the PM, Finance Minister, Northern Region Premier, and Western Region Premier. This instability led to a retaliation coup, a series of pogroms against Igbo civilians. By May 1967, the declaration of Biafra’s independence, precipitating Nigeria’s Civil War. Also in 1966, Iran announced its intention to abrogate an agreement had governed shipping on the Shatt Arab River on the Iran-Iraq border since 1937. Though Iraq’s Arif regime defused the situation, Baath continued to gain power. Since Syrian Baath sidelined Aflaq in 1963, he waged a coup by 1966, leading Jadid to purge 400 officials and officers and promote fellow Alawite Hafez Asad to Defense Minister. In June 1967, the Soviets aided Egypt, Syria, and Jordan with support from Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia to invade Israel in the Six Day War. After Israel won, Egypt closed Suez Canal and Arab oil exporters embargoed oil against America, Britain, and West Germany for nearly a decade. But as TRC raised production limits, unlike in 1957, oil prices did not spike. In America, the Black Power activists divisively aligned with Arabs. As Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank, Palestine Electric Co was renamed Israel Electric Corp and became the primary electricity provider in the region. Nonetheless, in line with Palestinian initiatives from the 1930s, the Palestinian territories established their own electricity distribution companies. After failing to gain a UN government in the West Bank, Mohammed Jabari of Hebron developed the local Islamic sharia college into Hebron Uni in 1971. He was subsequently elected as Mayor of Hebron. Soon after Mohammed died in 1980, his son became President of Hebron Uni in 1983. By then his Jabari clan grew to 30,000 people. With the Suez Canal blockade, Britain was desperate to maintain oil imports and supported a ‘One Nigeria’ solution was largely motivated by its economic interests in Nigerian oil, notably through Shell-British Petroleum, and the need to ensure oil-related stability. While Britain and Nigeria blockaded Biafra, resulting in severe malnutrition and disease among civilians, France, seeking to diminish

provided a line of credit for Chile’s steel industry. By 1972, Allende nationalized Anaconda and Kennecott copper companies with the cooperation of copper companies and America to prevent the Socialist Party from exploiting the issue in the elections. In Africa, meanwhile, race continued to intertwine domestic and international politics. In 1969, Ghana’s new PM Kofi Busia required illegal foreigners to obtain work permits or leave. This policy led to the expulsion of between 20,000 and 500,000 Nigerians within three months. To destabilize Sudan, Israel supported General Idi Amin’s coup in Uganda in 1971 by supporting a regime in Uganda that would counteract Sudanese influence. Citing economic malpractice and corruption, Amin soon expelled over 80,000 Indians from Uganda to promote Black African commerce. Soon after, Amin oversaw mass killings carried out by death squads targeting farmers, students, bankers, and politicians from different tribes. In July 1971, Sudan’s military coup ousted Nimeiri, but Egypt and Libya reinstated him. As the Soviet Union refrained from congratulating Nimeiri upon his return, Sudan’s execution of fourteen Communists fueled East European propaganda. While the Soviet press ignored Nimeiri’s notice to cease attacks on his regime, he expelled the Soviet consul and Bulgarian ambassador, and executed Communist leaders and banned the Communist Party. Despite criticism from Cairo, Nimeiri renewed relations with America and granted South Sudan more autonomy in 1972. While America extended EXIM loans and materials for a cotton factory, relations slowed as Khartoum handed Palestinians convicted of murdering American diplomats to PLO. Likewise, Egyptian President Sadat initiated a series of purges to remove pro-Soviet elements from Egypt and, in July 1972, expelled as many as 20,000 Soviet military advisers, while continuing to receive Soviet military supplies. Despite making multiple promises of imminent decisive action, the international community remained skeptical of Sadat’s intentions, while discussions between Israel’s PM Meir and Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu hinted at the possibility of Israeli-Egyptian meetings on a diplomatic level. However, his expectations of support from America and the West were not met. Consequently, in 1973, Sadat made the explicit decision to go to war with Israel as a deliberate strategy to create a crisis that would change the prevailing attitudes and potentially pave the way for negotiations. Also in 1972, another bad Soviet harvest led Narodny to buy record grain with gold via MMEU for the first time since 1965, with plans to open a Canadian branch. With American oil imports and inflation growing in 1973, BHCs hedged FX risk with MMEU and depositors ran from banks. So, President Nixon floated the dollar from gold, quelling inflation and ending Bretton Woods. FRS suspended Reg Q for large CDs. In April, Nixon replaced 1959’s oil import quotas—that led to OPEC—with tariffs for domestic production. After Jamaica led neighbors in hiking aluminum taxes in June, the nonaligned summit in Algiers crystallized the ideological legitimacy of the movement of Third World economic nationalism in September, and OPEC shocked global energy in October. On Judaism’s holiest days, Yom Kippur, Soviet-financed Egypt and Syria invaded

Coleman Young in 1973, he proposed a 50/50 partnership between Black and majority businesses and professionals who had been previously excluded from city work. As urban America elected Black mayors since the 1970s, they mirrored these policies in cities like Cleveland (Carl Stokes, since 1967), Los Angeles (Tom Bradley, 1973), Atlanta (Maynard Jackson, 1974), Washington DC (Marion Barry, 1979), Chicago (Harold Washington, 1983), and NYC (David Dinkins, 1990). So, minorities grew in public finance banking. While American Express Shearson Loeb hired Napoleon Brandford as a VP in 1982, he left to form Grigsby Brandford, the premier Black-owned investment bank, by 1985. And after Clarence Otis started at Kidder in 1984, he left to become a CSFB VP in 1987. Having reorganized New York City, Rohatyn hired New York City’s Budget Office’s general counsel, Eugene Keilin—who was White, but whose father represented poor and Black clients in Texan courts after WWII—to advise Cleveland, Detroit, and the United Steelworkers Union. Rohatyn also hired OMB Associate Director Frank Raines after Carter’s defeat to reorg debt in DC, Chicago, Iowa, and Texas. A year after Raines became the first Black big broker partner at Lazard in 1985, Goldman promoted Garland Wood, who had graduated Columbia Business in 1972 and then advised municipal bond refunding for California, Kentucky, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. After graduating Harvard in 1971, Puerto Rican Aida Alvarez reported news for seven years before served as VP of New York’s Health & Hospitals Corp in 1984. Within a year, she became a Public Finance VP at Bear until 1988, when she moved to do the same job at CSFB. While Rohatyn built support for a new RFC, Reagan listened to OMB’s Stockman and economist Alan Greenspan that it would crowd out private investment and continued to oppose it. Likewise, CSFB hired Ron Gault as a public finance director. The Chicago-born Grinnell College graduate worked with Urban League until joining federal service in 1964—including USAID, State Department, and DOJ—until 1969, when he joined the Ford Foundation until 1978 and advised Mayor Ed Koch afterward. Blacks also broke into dealmaking. Born to a roofer and maid in Virginia, William Lewis—unrelated to Reginald—earned subsidies to attend Andover and Harvard before joining Morgan Stanley in 1982. By 1987, Lewis helped open Morgan Stanley’s Chicago office. Similarly, a social worker mother raised Raymond McGuire in Ohio before he attended Hotchkiss and Harvard and joined CSFB in 1982. So did Black women. The daughter of a Brooklyn minister from South Carolina, Deborah Wright graduated Harvard, Harvard Business, and Harvard Law by the age of 26 in 1984. Joining CSFB in corporate finance, she left in 1987 to become an affordable home ownership advocate in Harlem. (While her relationship to Citizens & Southern’s Richard Wright is unclear, her grandfather was a reverend in South Carolina and her aunt, Marian, was a civil rights advocate, Yale Law graduate, and founder of Children’s Defense Fund in 1973. Like the wives of Vernon Jordan, Kenneth Chenault, and other Black elites, Marian

left after opposing the merger that created Credit Suisse First Boston in 1978. After stints with Warburg and Merrill Lynch, he founded Phoenix. Meanwhile, the Guinness family no longer led the family brewer and kinterlinked with the Jewish Samuel of Hill Samuel in 1980. That following year, Guinness hired consultancy Bain to grow via acquisition to avoid becoming a takeover target. In 1982, Bain’s Olivier Roux joined Guinness as a consultant and became Director of Financial Strategy in 1984, advising Ernest Saunders. Saunders became CEO, sold 160 companies, focused on retail and brewing, and acquired specialty foods, publishing, and 7-Eleven stores. By mid-1985, profits and share price increased. Saunders led the takeover of Distillers Co and coordinated with Ivan Boesky and Morgan Grenfell. Guinness auditors discovered invoices for services from investors. An investigation by the British Department of Trade & Industry led Saunders to resign. Roux resigned in 1987. While Roux resigned, Bain’s tarnished reputation led her to reduce 10% of her workforce. As Morgan Grenfell resigned as Guinness’ merchant banker, BOE pressured Morgan Grenfell Chair Stephen Catto to remove Chris Reeves. Following the scandal, Phoenix’s John Craven became CEO of Morgan Grenfell in 1987, arranging the acquisition of Phoenix as part of the move. In 1988 he shuttered the lossmaking Morgan Grenfell Securities. As BOE restricted Reeves from executive roles, Merrill Lynch’s Michael Clemm recruited him as Senior Adviser in 1988. In America, meanwhile, managements lobbied Congress to revive TA69 hybrid debt limits and remove HYB tax shields from hostile LBOs. As Congress debated, courts allowed management to employ poison pills against raiders in 1985, and firms lobbied states to codify management rights to shield themselves with this device. Indian companies had already employed such techniques in 1929. By 1985, as India’s State Bank of India grew merchant banking services, Lazard expanded into India. After holding key positions in Asia-Pacific with Grindlay and Deutsche, Udayan Bose became Chair of a new a joint-venture with Lazard London by 1985, forming create India’s first multinational investment bank, Credit Capital (“Lazard India”). While Bose chaired Kolkata Stock Exchange to modernize and attract foreign investors, he also made deals, advising on Marwari R.P. Goenka’s acquisition of HMV. While Lehman Kuhn Chair Pete Peterson named Lewis Glucksman co-CEO in 1983, they had different goals in mind, with Peterson wanting to sell the firm and Glucksman to grow it. As Glucksman sought to oust Peterson, most of the board supported him, but Peterson allies like Stephen Schwarzman and the sole outside director, Enrico Braggiotti of Banca Commercial Italiana. As Peterson left without a fight, Glucksman became more tyrannical and mortally wounded Lehman Kuhn. After buying Safra’s Trade Development Bank of Switzerland in 1983, American Express Shearson Loeb acquired Lehman Kuhn in 1984 and forced Glucksman out. Only briefly considering joining Lazard, Peter Peterson and Stephen Schwarzman took their winnings to start Blackstone to focus on LBOs Like Peterson derived from the Greek word for stone, Schwarzman’s surname came from the German word for black. While

16.5% from 1995 to 2011. Since TA86’s health inflation pushed middle class consumers to credit cards for liquidity. Since the Court unchained credit card interest rates from state usury laws in 1978, creditors increasingly lent to subprime borrowers. The legislation of the 1970s prohibited merchants from imposing surcharges on credit card transactions to offset the interchange fees charged to them directly. However, it permitted merchants to offer discounts for cash purchases. As credit cards enticed consumers with rewards, this law forced consumers with lower education, income, predictable cash flows, or credit scores to pay for the rewards in a ‘reverse Robin Hood’ situation. With growing health expenses and other expense burdens, consumers—primarily single women—filed for bankruptcy to discharge their debt in historic numbers after the Panic of 1989. And as unemployment grants and out-of-wedlock births peaked, Clinton stabilized UST budget deficits, Congress replaced Great Society grants with poor law-like earned income tax credits, collapsing out-of-wedlock births. Although Black securities financiers suffered, most soon recovered. Underwriting muni deals for Lehman, Charles Bell’s earnings soared by 1992 along with issuance. As Lazard exited the business due to allegations of misconduct, Bell left Lehman to start Bell in 1996. Within 2 months, Bell became advisor to Los Angeles and Compton, California, soon after. But as munis collapsed in the Panic of 1997, Bell shifted to asset management. Like with Lazard, misconduct allegations felled Calvin Grigsby. So, Muriel Siebert took Siebert public and merged with Napoleon Branford and another partner from Grigsby Brandford, Suzzane Shank, to create the largest MWO-securities firm by 1997. As Clinton appointed her Head of SBA in 1997, Aida Alvarez became the first Latina and Puerto Rican to serve in the Cabinet, and increased loans to MWO small businesses. After an overspending scandal led Hazel O’Leary to resign from DOE in early 1997, she joined her husband’s consulting firm and later served as president and COO at Blaylock, a Black investment bank, briefly before returning to lead Fisk Uni. Perhaps the most successful was Robert Smith’s technology private equity firm. After advising Apple and Hewlett-Packard at Goldman, Smith co-founded Vista Equity Partners in Austin, Texas, in 2000. Benefiting from MWO allocations and the Panic of 2000, Vista sucsesfully acquired struggling technology firms with pension dollars. Instead of hiring elites for government and bank contacts, Vista recruit people from diverse backgrounds, which helped lower costand turnover. MWO contracts had even greater impact outside of finance, transferring tax funds into private hands rather than larger public corporations. David Steward grew up in a segregated Clinton, Missouri, in a working-class family. After graduating from Central Missouri Uni, Steward began his career in sales at railroads and FedEx. In 1983, he acquired an auditing firm for the transportation industry that he developed into World Wide Technology (“WWT”). Focusing on government contracts for minority suppliers, he served state and federal governments. A significant contract to supply American troops in Bosnia in 1995 became available when General Electric lost the deal due to its failure to

Credit Suisse before founding Trident Investment Management. Their sister, Indra Nooyi, joined Boston Consulting Group after Yale, and then Pepsi in 1994. She became President in 2001, CEO in 2006, and Chair soon after. Nooyi became the 11th woman running a S&P 500 company, along with Patricia Woertz at Archer Daniels Midland and Irene Rosenfeld at Kraft Foods. Still, female corporate officers barely budged since 2002. Under John Mack, Nigerian-born and Justice Thurgood Marshall’s onetime clerk Bayo Ogunlesi rose to head CSFB’s global investment banking department and joined the executive committee in 2002. By 2004, CSFB appointed Ogunlesi to Vice Chair and Chief Client Officer to manage global corporate and sovereign clients. Likewise, fellow French West Africans prospered. After inheriting plantations in Ivory Coast in the 1920s, Félix Houphouet-Boigny united Black landowners to oust while colonists and become Africa’s longest serving President from 1960 until his death in 1997. Since Houphouet-Boigny established his first plantation in 1926, his family expanded into various sectors including agroindustry, insurance, retail trade, electronics, telecommunications, and transportation. This family occupied the central role among Ivory Coast political-economic elite. Houphouet-Boigny’s niece, Henriette Diabaté, married Amadou Thiam, a real estate developer. Amadou’s son Tidjane had attended elite Parisian schools and worked for eight-years at McKinsey before returning to Ivory Coast to lead development initiatives from 1993. In the early 18th century, Sekou Ouattara’s coup in Kong, within modern-day Ivory Coast, established the Ouattara Empire, safeguarding the independence of Kong States amidst competition with Ghana’s Ashanti. Since Houphouet-Boigny’s Baoulé ancestors were from Ghana, regional boundaries changed, Sekou’s descendant, Alassane Ouattara, was born to a father from Ivory Coast and mother from Burkina Faso. Earning a doctorate from Uni of Pennsylvania in 1972, Alassane joined Central Bank of French West Africa in 1973, and soon became special adviser to Governor Abdoulaye Fadiga. When Burkina Faso’s turn to promote a Vice-Governor in 1982, Houphouet-Boigny negotiated with the head of that government to appoint Alassane. Soon after, Alassane Ouattara rose to Governor for two-years before Houphouet-Boigny appointed him the PM and Finance Minister of Ivory Coast in 1990. However, as Houphouet-Boigny died in 1993, leadership transitioned to Henry Bedie, with Baoulé cocoa planter origins tracing back to Ghana. As legal changes required presidential candidates to have both parents born in Ivory Coast, Alassane left to be IMF Deputy Director General from 1994 to 1997. With a low 0.5% growth rate in West African Monetary Union since 1990, Central Bank of French West Africa halved the currency in 1994 to fuel exports. That year, West African Monetary Union transformed into West African Economic & Monetary Union to include economic integration. Through reforms, competitiveness improved, and the growth rate surged by 1997, and Guinea-Bissau joined the union. But during Ivory Coast’s government coup in 1999, Thiam fled to France, where he became a partner at McKinsey in 2000. After two years, he left McKinsey for the newly formed Aviva insurer in Britain. For non-protected dimensions of identity, discrimination was even more brazen. From

period. Around 650 Black churches filed for bankruptcy as creditors charged higher credit rates and rejected loan modifications. With fewer church resources, Black communities lost credit resources. Unlike Black and Native American peers, Asian and Hispanic banks benefited from strong foreign demand to invest in America. Among the largest MWO banks were Cathay Bank and BBCN of California, International Bank of Commerce (“IBC”) of Texas, Lumbee Guaranty Bank of North Carolina, being the largest among banks owned by Chinese, Korean, Hispanic, and Native Americans, respectively. By this point, only one president nominated a Protestant to the Court since 1985. As Sandra Day O’Connor retired in 2006 and Samuel Alito replaced her, Catholics formed a majority on the Court for the first time. This Catholic majority was then bolstered by the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor in 2009. By the time Elena Kagan joined the Court in 2010, there were no Protestant justices left. Republicans turned to a Mormon. Since 2003, Bain’s Mitt Romney had been Governor of Massachusetts until 2007. He was the Republican nominee for the presidential election in 2012 and ran against the incumbent President, Obama. Although Mitt lost that race, Utah elected him to the Senate in 2018. Before that, Black communities in the industrial state of Michigan, which Mitt’s father governed in the 1960s, deteriorated. As calls for public water control grew, American municipalities stopped privatizing. Despite the increase of private equity assets, American cities and courts continued to limit the ability of private equity to trade water investments, which drove global private equity infrastructure. After UST bailed out automotive manufacturers using the bankruptcy process in 2009, Michigan applied a similar approach to Detroit before providing state aid in 2013. Within months, Detroit exited the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history through an $816 million deal involving major philanthropic foundations. Judge Gerald Rosen led efforts to secure funds from foundations, the State of Michigan, and Detroit Institute of Arts to protect city retirees’ pensions and the art collection. The ‘grand bargain’ allowed Detroit to shed $7 B in debt and invest $1.7 B in services and repairs. Key contributors included Ford Foundation, which pledged $125 million, Knight Foundation, which contributed $30 million, and Kresge Foundation, which pledged $100 million. The State of Michigan provided $350 million over 20 years. While Michigan did not allow the surrounding municipalities to file for bankruptcy, the emergency oversight extended to them. One of these, Flint, was heavily indebted to Detroit for treated drinking water. So, Flint’s emergency and local government leadership agreed with the municipal water utility to switch to cheaper sources, resulting in lead poisoning outbreaks in 2014. To manage budgets, some municipalities continued to subvert the criminal justice system, increasing civil fines and penalties against minorities. Gas advances revived the automotive sector, stimulated American growth, and reduced trade deficits. Amidst revolutions across the energy-subsidy-reforming petrostates and Japan’s nuclear catastrophe inflated oil—and the gap with gas—the White House released Strategic Petroleum Reserves. Even though TXU generated power from coal, her

with Adani’s December deal to build drones in Israel. Following Modi’s June 2018 meeting with Singapore’s PM, a Singaporean firm invested 1,000 crores in Adani ports that July. In February 2020, Modi met Sri Lanka’s PM, and Adani was involved in a port project by July. While ArcelorMittal and Tata struggled with European steel, another Hindu steel baron came to their rescue. Born in 1971 in Ludhiana, India, Sanjeev Gupta’s grandfather owned steel mills, and his father built a bicycle manufacturing business in Britain. While Gupta focused on commodities trading from 1993, he expanded into steel and metals, acquiring assets globally over the next two decades. From invested in steel plants in South Wales in 2013, Gupta gained wider attention by buying Tata’s British steel assets in 2016, followed by ArcelorMittal’s plants in Romania, Czechia, and several other European countries in 2019. By 2022, Indians—ranging from multigenerational residents to international investors—were the largest property owners in London, followed by White Britons and Pakistanis. Along with corporations, Indian technology powered global real estate. After earning an engineering masters from SUNY Stony Brook and an MBA from Eastern Michigan Uni, Mohan Asnani co-founded CompuWave and BMAK Computer Systems for engineering and construction-related services by the 1980s and then expanded to buying, developing, and selling real estate in California. While Asnani’s son started at Morgan Stanley, the pair founded Mumbai-based knowledge process outsourcing company Prothious Engineering Services by 2002 and soon served clients across six continents contributed. Along with projects such as rebuilding World Trade Center in New York City in the 2010s, the Asnani family launched REITs and other ventures. Promotion of the new elite was strong in government-owned Citi. On Citi’s board since 1996 and advisor to Obama in 2008, Richard Parsons became Citi’s first Black Chair in 2009. At the same time, he became Senior Advisor to Providence Equity Partners, a media and entertainment focused LBO, while remaining on the boards of Estée Lauder and Madison Square Garden. The same year, his co-racial, Raymond McGuire rose from co-Head of Citi’s investment banking to Head of global banking. Fathered by a Black man who died when he was young, Robert Reffkin was raised by his Israeli immigrant mother cast out by her Jewish family. Graduating from Columbia Uni in just over two years, Reffkin joined McKinsey as the youngest Analyst and then Lazard, where he founded the firm’s minority professional internship program. Later, he became a VP at Goldman, where he served as Chief of Staff to Gary Cohn. Along with founding mentorship to first-generation college students, Reffkin co-founded tech-driven real estate Compass in 2012, among the Fortune 500’s first Black founders. Peter Orszag, mentored by Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers and previously overseeing Brookings Institute’s Hamilton Project, concentrated on healthcare policy and climate change as Obama’s OMB Director from 2007, helping enact the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“ACA”). In 2010, he married the daughter of the CIO for BHP Billiton’s petroleum unit. By 2012, the partially nationalized Citi made

appointees were family of powerful politicians. To push his ambitious infrastructure agenda, he named Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s wife Taiwanese-born Elaine Chao. While the first and highest Asian American woman in the federal government, her sister and Lazard’s Bruce Wasserstein’s widow, Angela, was Head of China iron shipping Foremost and ascended to Bank of China’s board in in 2017. While appointing Mitt Romney’s niece to Chair the Republican National Committee, Trump named Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee’s daughter as White House Press Secretary. Goldman Managing Director and Coptic Egyptian Dina Habib became Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, advising on foreign policy, with an emphasis on the Middle East. Bypassing anti-nepotism law, Trump mirrored his family business as he appointed his children and in-laws as senior White House advisory ‘consultants’ and appointed his son-in-law to lead DOE’s climate policy. Amidst numerous potential conflicts of interest and possible violations of the Emoluments Clause during his presidency, Trump’s golf and hotel properties garnered $7.8 million from 20 foreign governments, notably $5.5 million from China and $615,000 from Saudi Arabia. Notably, the Chinese payments included a pre-existing 2008 lease with Industrial & Commercial Bank of China. Additionally, Trump secured 67 trademarks from foreign governments during his presidency, with 46 originating from China. While Trump’s businesses faced accusations of offering overpriced goods or services, they were distinguished from Hunter Biden and others who allegedly facilitated access to influential politicians. Although Rudy Giuliani was initially favored to be Secretary of State, his business ties led him to remove himself from consideration for cabinet positions and to serve as a personal lawyer to President Trump and later helped secure a pardon for Michael Milken. In January 2017, President Trump began efforts to reduce illegal immigration by reallocating resources to border detention facilities and directing the hiring of 10,000 new ICE officers. McKinsey, previously contracted in 2015 under the Obama administration to help reorganize ICE’s Enforcement & Removal Operations division, was redirected to assist with these new policies. The firm proposed reducing expenses on detainee food and medical care, which concerned ICE employees who feared these cuts would harm detainees. McKinsey also recommended speeding up deportations, raising alarms about potential violations of due process for migrants. Tensions surfaced in meetings between McKinsey consultants and ICE staff, with the latter questioning the human cost of these measures. Since Republican Congressman Eric Cantor became the first Jew to lead a chamber of Congress in 2011, New York Senator Charles Schumer became the first Jew to be the Senate Minority Leader in 2016. While Trump’s son-in-law was Jewish, Trump’s campaign aired an ad mocking Lloyd Blankfein, Janet Yellen, and George Soros, emboldening White supremacists. After demonstrators in Charlottesville chanted antisemitic and anti-Black slogans while carrying torches in August 2017, the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue claiming eleven lives in 2018, and a San Diego synagogue was attacked, resulting in one death and several injuries, including a rabbi, during Passover the following year.

Prior to the Pittsburgh massacre, the attacker had subscribed to antisemitic, White nationalist conspiracy theories that Jews incite ‘hatred against Whites’ and support minority immigration to alter Western demographics. But as left-wing Israel divestment protests spread through colleges, Trump reaffirmed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against antisemitism in 2019. Meanwhile, as four Black Congressmen called on Yellen for identity diversity in 2017, Obama’s housing policy official Raphael Bostic became the first Black and openly gay person to lead a regional FRS bank when he was appointed as the president of FRS Atlanta. The following year, Mary Daly, who had been with FRS San Francisco since 1996, became the first openly gay woman to lead a regional FRS bank. After Theresa May became Britain’s second female and first Anglo-Catholic PM in 2017, her successor, Boris Johnson, became the first baptized Roman Catholic to hold the office. After Bulgarian-born daughter of a civil engineer, Kristalina Georgieva, took charge of the EU budget at the European Commission, she left to become CEO of BANK’s International Bank for Reconstruction & Development in 2017. Becoming the first female (interim) president of BANK in 2019, Georgieva left to become the first person from an emerging market to lead IMF as Christine Lagarde became ECB’s first female lead. But all 19 euro country governors were men. After appointing Indian-born Harvard Professor Gita Gopinath to be IMF’s first Chief Economist in 2019, Georgieva promoted Gopinath as her First Deputy in 2022. As Britons voted to leave the EU in 2019 in Brexit, RBS promoted Alison Rose to CEO and the first woman to lead a large British bank. Since acquiring NatWest in 2000 and ABN Amro in 2007, RBS required a £45 billion Exchequer bailout during the Panic of 2007. In response, RBS downsized from 109,000 employees in 2013 to 66,600 by 2019, and exited 26 of the 28 countries she operated in. Unlike in America, Exchequer incurred massive losses after reducing her RBS stake, including £2.1 billion loss when selling from 70.1 to 62.4% in 2018 and another £1.1 billion from 61.7% to 59.8% in 2021. Over this period, Rose oversaw RBS’ rebranding to NatWest in 2020 and introduced policies, such as paternity leave and halting new financing for oil and gas companies without credible climate transition plans. Accepting an invitation from Exchequer to review barriers to female entrepreneurship, Rose collaborated with McKinsey to develop the report. Since Stephanie Cohen became Goldman Partner in

banner of ‘effective altruism.’ One was Caroline Ellison, the Catholic daughter of an MIT economics professor (where SEC Chair Gary Gensler had once taught a blockchain course), studied math at Stanford. She gained experience through internships at Jane Street before joining Alameda as a trader and Sam’s girlfriend, became its CEO by late 2021. (Despite Sam’s insistence to hedge Alameda investments, Caroline did not.) While entertainer private investors like Kevin O’Leary accepted these family links as proof of compliance in the unregulated crypto market, less informed celebrities hawked cryptos for profited (like social media allowed them to do with public policy generally.) While Sam donated $40 to Democrats, FTX COO Ryan Salame donated $24 million to Republicans, including over-limits to his wife Michelle Bond’s run for Congress, after she led lobbying firm Association for Digital Assets Markets in DC with FTX support. Gary Wang and Nishad Singh rounded out FTX’s diverse leadership. Meanwhile, Black banks continued to disappear. Although FRS had launched the Partnership for Progress to support and preserve minority-owned banks in 2008, the number of Black-owned banks fell from 48 in 2001 to 18 in 2020. Although Tri-State Bank of Memphis survived, Jesse Turner sold the headquarters in exchange for equity and deposits and resigned having led for three decades after taking over from his father. Despite constituting America’s largest minority (16%), Black’s share of MWO deposit equity capital collapsed. Before long, the split was Asian (55.2%), Hispanic (40.4%), Native American (2.4%), Black (2.0%), and Multiracial (0.1%). Moreover, Asian banks became more power as Cathay Bank bought SinoPac Far East NB in 2017. While Asian trade stimulated Asian banks, Tri-State Bank and other Black banks had made loans to Black churches for decades. But in late 2017, the Congressionally-chartered non-profit National Trust for Historic Preservation launched its African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund with partners including Open Society Foundation, Ford Foundation, and Picower Foundation (run by the widow of Madoff’s accountant) to protect Black cultural heritage sites. Raising over $91 million within five years, the fund supported 242 preservation projects, including churches, colleges, artwork, and other historic monuments of pride and resistance. Along with Black-owned banks, banks generally decreased in majority-Black neighborhoods by 14.6% since 2010. Morgan reduced its branch presence in these areas by 22.8% from 2010 to 2018, compared to a 0.2% decline in the rest of America. Although FA10 had mandated SEC, UST’s OCC, FRS, FDIC, CFPB, and National Credit Union Administration establish Offices of Minority & Women Inclusion (“OMWIs”) to oversee diversity matters and develop standards for assessing diversity policies of entities regulated by them, FA10 steered big banks away from majority-Black exurban areas and other risky investments by capping big bank debit card fee profits to protect consumers. As small banks credit constricted, Black business switched to fintech nonbanks to meet liquidity. Joining Koch in lobbying against taxes, Soros’ Open Society Foundation funded criminal justice reform at the municipal election level from 2015. Pivoting from national elections, Soros directed millions of dollars into

Goldman Marcus-Apple card relied on another partner, MasterCard. Not wanting to wait for Vikram Pandit to retire from Citi in 2012, the son of a Sikh lieutenant general, Ajay Banga left to lead MasterCard in 2010. Following his brother, Manvinder left Unilever to join Clayton Dubilier Rice LBO. By 2018, Facebook’s Instagram hired Ajay’s daughter as Media Product Strategist. While MasterCard and Visa backed Facebook’s Libra crypto project in 2020, regulatory and public pressure folded Libra by 2019. As MasterCard brought crypto on to their network in early 2021, Facebook’s Instagram promoted Aditi Banga from Head of Shopping Partnerships to Creator Monetization & Innovation Partnerships. Leaving MasterCard, Ajay became an advisor to General Atlantic’s climate fund and served on the boards of American Red Cross, Kraft Foods, and Dow. Like with fintechs, talent and capital fled banks to less regulated entities. In 2013, Deutsche real estate private equity executives Justin Kennedy and Tobin Cobb left to form a private real estate investment trust and development corporation. Even hedge funds and private equity faced competition from family offices. Among the largest offices were Michael Dell’s MSD Capital, Bill Gates’ Cascade Investment, and Bloomberg-founder and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s Willett Advisors. MSD Capital’s successful ventures include the acquisition of IndyMac Bank during the Panic of 2007. Once seen as a successor to Morgan Stanley’s Gorman, Greg Fleming left in 2017 to form Rockefeller multi-family office. By 2021, more women led family offices than corporations or other investment vehicles. Sergey Brin hired Marie Young as CIO in January 2022. Melinda Lewison managed Jeff Bezos’ office. Suzi Kwon Cohen oversaw investments for Chanel heirs. Hedge fund investor Dan Och chose Mira Muhtadie. Wendy Craft manages the family office of real estate heir Kent Swig. Women also managed family offices for Oprah Winfrey as well as the Hershey and Heinz families. In 2023, Lazard formed Lazard Family Office Partners by buying the female-owned Truvvo. Within months, the daughter of Reginald Lewis, the first Black to take over a billion dollar corporation, formed Beatrice, the first multi-family office led by a Black woman. As Jamie Dimon planned retirement, he continued grooming possibly successors. Back in 2009, Lazard Chicago’s Mary Callahan rose from Head of Morgan Private Bank replaced him, becoming head of Asset & Wealth Management and joining the Operating Committee. By 2013, Morgan promoted British-born Marianne Lake to CFO. The daughter of an IBM programmer and an airline ticketing agent, Lake studied physics at Uni of Reading and worked as a chartered accountant at Pricewaterhouse Cooper before joining Morgan in 1999. She served as Global Controller of the Investment Bank from 2007 to 2009 and CFO of Consumer & Community Banking from 2009 to 2012, dealing with the Panic of 2007 and trading scandals. Unmarried, she had three children via surrogate. Another powerful Morgan woman was Jennifer O’Connor Piepszak. Joining Morgan in 1994 after graduating Fairfield Uni, Piepszak served as CEO of the card services and business banking units, CFO of the

UBS, Credit Suisse did not require a bailout after the Panic of 2007. After Swiss lawyer Urs Rohner became General Counsel of Banking in 2004, he rose to Banking COO and Vice Chair by 2009. In 2011, Credit Suisse named Swiss lawyer Urs Rohner as Chair, having impressed management by delaying investigation payouts to boost profits. While fellow board directors included a Harvard professor studying workplace gender equality and a Google inventor, Rohner’s Vice Chair was the CEO of drugmaker Roche. Other similarly qualified highly paid directors included Qatari royal and the son of a former Credit Suisse Chair. By 2013, Rohner and his CEO, Brady Dougan, hired Iqbal Khan as CFO Private Banking & Wealth Management. Born to a Swiss mother and likely a cousin of Pakistan’s political Khan dynasty, Khan moved from Karachi to Switzerland in 1982, where he held various positions at Ernst Young and became the Managing Partner of Assurance & Advisory Services for Financial Services in 2011. Under Rohner, Credit Suisse became a proponent of gender diversity, striving to elevate women to key positions within the bank. While surveys concluded that better female representation leads to higher share price valuation, female executives continued departing. Along with a project to re-engage women, Dougan formed a ‘super-department’ including communication, marketing, talent development, branding, and personnel, hiring Pamela Thomas, McKinsey’s first Black female partner and former CEO of CNBC and Liz Claiborne. Although Thomas did not move from New York for Switzerland, Dougan appointed her Chair of Credit Suisse New Markets to build the bank’s market share with women, Blacks, and LGBT by 2014. In 2015, Rohner replaced Dougan with Tidjane Thiam, a nonbanker from Prudential, leading Thomas to resign after losing her overarching role and Executive Board seat. As Thiam bolstered domestic operations to create a new ‘Swiss Universal Bank’, escalating competition led UBS to hire Martin Blessing, a fellow McKinsey alum who formed CEO Commerzbank Dresdner, to lead its Swiss operations (while his wife Dorothee served as Morgan’s Vice Chair of international investment banking and investment banking head in Israel, German-speaking, and Nordic countries.) By 2018, UBS consolidated global wealth management under Blessing. To execute his vision, Thiam continued Dougan’s project with Rohner’s support. As both believed that competent people could succeed without experience, they promoted investment banker Lara Warner Chief Compliance and Regulatory Affairs Officer with a seat on the Executive Board. By 2019, she became Chief Risk Officer, reporting directly to Thiam, alongside Lydie Hudson, whom he promoted from COO of Global Markets to Chief Compliance Officer with an Executive Board seat. Warner soon sidelined risk expertise to promote front office sales by removing senior risk managers, changing reporting structures, and impeding the implementation of risk tools. Also in 2015, UST’s clampdown on tax evasion led Thiam to shift from volatile trading to stable wealth management. With a strategy of issue stock to buy Swiss banks and expand to Russia, the Middle East, Brazil, and Mexico, Thiam promoted Khan to CEO of International Wealth

American political power. While Indian-American Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy lost in the Republican presidential election to Donald Trump, the latter selected JD Vance—the White husband of Usha Chilukuri—for his running mate after Biden dropped out. Even as Trump proposed to lower taxes and Harris committed to increasing them for corporations and the wealthy, Harris’ supporters included the Soros family, Blackstone’s Jonathan Gray, Bill Gates, Lazard’s Peter Orszag and Ray McGuire, Roger Altman, who led investment banking at Lehman before founding Evercore; and Robert Rubin, former co-Chair of Goldman and UST Secretary. Of the over 90 other corporate executives and heirs backing Harris were the Pritzkers, Waltons, and Microsoft’s Reid Hoffman, who urged her to replace Lina Khan at FTC. Trump’s wealthy backers included Paulson’s John Paulson, Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman, Soros alum Scott Bessent, Elon Musk, and both co-founders of Andreessen Horwitz. While the tide turned against DEI, corporations continued coordinating visible executives. Both Ernst Young and Pricewaterhouse Cooper appointed the Big Four’s first non-White male chairs at the same time in late 2023 to start on the same day in 2024. While Ernst Young named CPA Janet Truncale as the first female chair, Pricewaterhouse Cooper selected Mohamed Kande, an electrical engineer from Ivory Coast who transitioned into consulting, as their first Black chair. Morgan also positioned women to succeed Jamie Dimon. Since naming Jennifer Piepszak and Marianne Lake co-heads of Morgan’s retail bank, Piepszak became co-head of the firm’s commercial and investment bank, leaving as the sole CEO. Likewise, Dorothee Blessing became global co-head of investment banking and Anu Aiyengar head of advisory as Mary Callahan remained head of Asset & Wealth Management. Recent International Panics of Eurasia In the mid-19th century, Friedrich Raiffeisen developed cooperative banking in Germany to provide credit to Christian farmers and craftsmen and exclude Jews. The Raiffeisen banking movement rapidly expanded beyond local areas, and by the early 1870s, the first regional cooperative credit union was established. Unlike unrestrained (Jewish) capitalism or state-run socialist bank, private regional auditing clearinghouses oversaw the cooperatives. During WWII, Germany nationalized Austrian banks, including Raiffeisen cooperatives. After the war, Rothschild Vienna and Frankfurt did not reopen, but Vienna-based Raiffeisen was able to reprivatize by 1955 and grew nationally. From 1970, Raiffeisen expanded into corporate and trade finance, with offices in Hong Kong, New York, Singapore, and London. Herbert Stepic grew Raiffeisen’s bank network to trade sugar, cocoa, and non-ferrous metals. In Japan, Nobusuke Kishi served as PM from 1957 to 1960. His son Eisaku Sato, served as PM from 1964 to 1972. As the streak ended, another family prospered. Takeo Fukuda was born in Japan’s Gumma district into a Samurai family. His grandfather co-founded Tokyo Stock Exchange, and his wife’s family owned a private gold mine in Japan. In 1929, Takeo joined the Ministry of Finance, where he rose through the ranks to become the Deputy Vice-Minister and lead the banking and budget bureaus after WWII. He left the Civil Service in 1952 to become a Diet member for

trade unions, including the National Union of Mineworkers. In June 1983, NUM secured wage increases for 6,000 employees on 41 gold mines. While remaining an Anti-Apartheid Movement executive, Ethel Katz became the director of British Defense & Aid Fund for Southern Africa by 1981, establishing a trust to train South African and Namibian exiles in Britain to contribute to democratic governance upon liberation. As BCCI broke British Barclay and Standard duopoly in Botswana, acted as Swaziland’s central bank, and was one of the few Zimbabwe allowed. Having nationalized oil and banks by 1971, Nigeria’s military turned to BCCI over IMF. While oil-rich shareholders had limited liability, BCCI paid bribes for Third World central bank deposits, exclusive handling of a country’s use of US commodity credits, and preferential treatment on the processing of money coming in and out of the country. Instead of recognizing losses, they bribed auditors and regulators for forbearance. As African debt default soared as droughts in the early 1980s stunted agriculture and hydroelectricity. So, Egypt used Aswan Dam water reserves, Ghana eliminated price control subsidies, and Zimbabwe developed coal with BANK aid. The drought of the Nile Valley also spurred religious tensions. After Sassoon and Cattaui created Bank of Cairo shortly before Nasser nationalized it in 1952, they partnered again in the 1970s and Solomon Menasche Sassoon married Josephine Cattaui in 1971. As Egypt became more market oriented and the Sudan gave autonomy to the non-Muslim South Sudan, Ethiopia continued to tolerate the Falasha—Black Jews—as the royalty claimed descent from King Solomon, antisemitism roared after a coup overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974. By 1975, Israel decided that the Falasha had the right to emigrate according to the religious ‘law of return.’ However, migration remained insignificant. As antisemitism accelerated with droughts from 1980, Falasha and other Ethiopians fled to the Sudan. With the influx of migrants and their own drought, Sudan was unable to service foreign debt and pay crony capitalist military officers at the same time. In 1983, President Nimeiri repartitioned the South, and imposed Sharia law nationwide, which soon escalated into a full-scale civil war. While Nimeiri allowed American and Israeli forces to airlift the famished Falasha, Solomon Sassoon participated as a doctor, he was captured and killed as an alleged spy. Amidst Nimeiri’s shifting political allegiances and maneuvers led to his removal from power by the military in 1985, followed by the election of Ahmed Mirghani. While Mali sought to stabilize by joining fellow Francophone agricultural-based economies in the West African Monetary Union in 1984, Ivory Coast and fellow members tried to diversify, but cocoa and coffee remained primary exports. As oil prices crashed in 1985, African exporter defaults spiked without drought amidst falling commodity prices in 1986. Although Cuba’s Fidel Castro called for a debtor’s cartel in 1982, BCCI’s Abedi called for an inter-national private-public Third World Bank in 1983. By 1985, Deutsche’s Herrhausen advocated a Third World debt pardon, but American bankers resisted. Within two years, most came around to conditional debt

Co retained ESKOM-linked thermal coal operations, they committed to focusing on mining from 2005, while buying back depressed shares. Meanwhile, Nigeria continued subsidizing electricity for the privileged while thieves pillaged oil meant for export. Following the Panic of 2007 collapsed foreign trade, capital flows, and tourism in West African Economic & Monetary Union, GDP slowed until food production expanded and Burkina Faso opened a large gold mine in 2010. That year, Ivory Coast removed the electoral requirement that both parents be Ivorian, allowing Ouattara to contest the election of incumbent Laurent Gbagbo. Although Houphouet-Boigny had imprisoned Gbagbo in the 1980s for public protests, Gbagbo refused to concede alleging foreign influence, to trigger civil war against the United Nations-backed Ouattara. As GDP fell and inflation soared across West African Economic & Monetary Union in 2011, instability arose with coups in Mali and Guinea-Bissau. After months amidst fierce fighting amidst Gbagbo’s death squads, Ouattara removed Gbagbo. Thiam, meanwhile, joined Prudential Insurance as CFO in 2008 before a promotion made him the first Black executive to head one of the London Stock Exchange’s hundred largest firms, and Credit Suisse soon after. Following his ouster from Credit Suisse after the Panic of 2020, Thiam ran against Outtara again in 2025, but the latter secured a fourth term as Thiam and Ghagbo had been banned. Meanwhile, the collusion between political and economic authority was rampant across the (Jewless) Islamic Middle East and North Africa. Since the 1950s, Masri was Palestine’s largest employer. After Sabih Masri’s brother Hikmat founded Palestine Liberation Organization (“PLO”) in 1964 with Yasser Arafat, his cousins formed Jordanian Vegetable Oils Co at year later. While Hikmat founded An-Najah Uni in Nalbus and held influential positions in Jordan’s government, his nephew Taher joined Jordan’s central bank. Sabih’s cousin Munib established EDGO, one of the region’s first privately owned engineering companies, to support oil and gas industry in the Gulf while working at Phillip Petroleum. By 1970, at King Hussein’s request, Munib served as Jordan’s Minister of Public Works and building road and water infrastructure. Along with developing the Saudi navy, EDGO supported Western companies as America invested in Gulf-wide naval defense from 1974. Likewise, Sabih’s Saudi-domiciled ASTRA expanded from catering contracts into construction from 1976, and soon fertilizer, telecommunications, and manufacturing prefabricated steel buildings, plastics, irrigation systems, and bedding). Also in 1976, Sabih’s brother Zafer joined Nablus’ Municipal Council after chairing the Chamber of Commerce. While Sabih Masri’s nephew Taher became Jordan’s Foreign Minister in 1984, Israel labeled PLO a terrorist organization, and appointed Sabih’s politically moderate brother Zafer Masri as the mayor of Nablus in 1985. As Zafer encouraged PLO to engage in diplomacy, pro-Syrian Palestinian groups assassinated him months for accommodating Israel and Jordan. Blaming Israel, Palestinian leaders founded Hamas in a secret meeting in Hebron in 1986. They included Muhammad Natsheh of Hebron, Jamal Mansour of Nablus, Mahmud Muslih of Ramallah, Jamil Hamami of Jerusalem, Ayman Abu Taha of Gaza, and Sheikhs Ahmed Yassin and Hassan Yousef. Yassin, later Hamas’

Bank, Goldman, Morgan Stanley, Morgan, HSBC. Re-entering Saudi Arabia, Citi appointed Khatib CEO of Citi Saudi Arabia by 2021, as Citi lent to the Kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund and worked on IPOs on Saudi Stock Exchange and Acwa Power. As Suhaimi joined the boards of Saudi Airlines and Saudi Telecom, Lazard hired her as Chair of Lazard MENA in 2022 and soon recruited Khatib as CEO. Celebrating her 175th anniversary in 2023, Lazard almost sold herself to Abu Dhabi, which invested in the management buyout of Fortress. Like fellow emirate Dubai, Abu Dhabi saw an influx of high-net-worth individuals and asset managers from Switzerland, Hong Kong, and New York due to lower taxes and access to the region, including Saudi Arabia, as global governments increased taxes on wealthy residents to address fiscal gaps after COVID. This trend included prominent asset managers like BlackRock, PGIM, Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and Schröder. Additionally, family offices, including Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio and Apollo’s Leon Black, established operations in the UAE. In response to this run to the Emirates, HSBC, Morgan Chase, and Morgan Stanley expanded their private banking teams and created dedicated units in the region. Meanwhile since the Arab nationalizations and wars against Israel, Jewish populations declined across Israel’s neighbors. Between 1947 and 2019 in Morocco (from 265,000 to 2,100), Algeria (from 140,000 to 200), Tunisia (from 105,000 to 1,000), Libya (from 38,000 to 0), Egypt (from 75,000 to 100), Iraq (from 135,000 to 7), Syria (from 30,000 to 100), Lebanon (from 5,000 to 100), and Yemen (from 63,000 to 50). Likewise, many Christians fled violence and persecution in the Middle East from 2000. While Iraq’s Christian population fell in half to 3% following the 2003 invasion, tens of thousands of Christians fled the Syrian civil war from 2011. By 2013, Christians in Lebanon accounted for 35% of the population, down from a previous majority. In Egypt, Christians made up about 10% of the population before the election of Mohamed Morsi in 2012, which fueled anti-Christian sentiment as clerics incited violence, resulting in church burnings and attacks. In Israel, however, Muslim Arabs grew to comprise over 20% of the population with full civil rights. Haj Yehia of Tayibe was Israel most prominent Arab tribe. Born to a landowner, Mohammed Yehia was one of the first Arab students at Tel Aviv Uni. While one of his sons was a finance attorney in Tayibe and headed Jordan Gateway Free Zone & Industrial Park, another headed Scotland’s heart transplant program. A third son accrued five degrees by the age of 30, including an MIT PhD, and served as VP of Fidelity in Boston and lectured in Harvard. Other relatives included a pharmacology professor in Uni of South Carolina and a senior United Nations official. Returning to Tayibe in 2012, Samer resisted political pressures, choosing instead to contribute to the family’s success. In 2019, he became the first Arab Chair of Bank Leumi’s Board. Against Trump-style border walls, Open Society, Tides, and similar Democrat grassroot voting campaigns funded
