Vernon Jordan was born in the segregated housing projects of Atlanta's west side. While a student at DePaul University, he worked as a chauffeur for the Maddox family of *First NB of Atlanta*. Following his graduation from Howard Law, a historically Black university, Jordan returned to Atlanta and began his career as a civil rights lawyer.

In the 1960s, Jordan played a crucial role in the desegregation of the University of Georgia, escorting the first Black student onto campus. During this decade, he collaborated with Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and other prominent figures in the civil rights movement, further cementing his commitment to racial equality.

After serving as Executive Director of the United Negro College Fund, Jordan succeeded Whitney Young as Executive Director of the Urban League in 1971. During his tenure at the Urban League, Jordan focused on promoting Black economic empowerment. He cultivated relationships within the business community, becoming known for connecting Black professionals with corporate leaders. This led to board service on several major companies including *Bankers Trust*, *Celanese*, *JC Penney*, *Union Carbide*, and *Rockefeller Foundation*.

In 1981, after Robert Strauss had difficulty securing endorsements from the Urban League and Black leaders for President Carter in 1976, Strauss hired Jordan to join the law firm *Akin Gump*. The aim was to leverage Jordan's extensive network for business development.
