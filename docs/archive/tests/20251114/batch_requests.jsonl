Although the founding Warner family continued to control Warner, Paramount sold Columbia Broadcasting System (\u201cCBS\u201d) to GE, Lehman, Brown Harriman by 1932. As CBS, RCA\u2019s National Broadcasting Co (\u201cNBC\u201d), GE, and Westinghouse led national stations chains, the airwaves were crowded were independents. While Jewish David Sarnoff of GE\u2019s RCA led NBC, his co-religionists led Columbia. However, most local stations outside New York lack Jewish ownership. But that was a long time off. Rather than ease funding, risk and term premia increased with growing regulation. Industrials had relied on bank loans for working capital and capital markets for capital expenditures, but security issuance deflated in early 1930. Businesses contracted trade credit for inventories and capital projects. Rising unemployment and falling tax revenues in the nation\u2019s automobile hub, Detroit, led to fiscal tightening. In Toledo, the founder of Willys-Overland sold control to a Chicago BIHC and Toledo bankers as he received a political appointment. As inventory liquidity fell, the new owners idled the plants to maintain dividends. By 1930, most Toledanos were unemployed and lost equity to banks after defaulting on mortgages loans. Following international peers, the unemployed empowered Congress to enact the Smoot-Hawley tariff on June 14. With less credit, the Security-Home SB further consolidated\u2014without write-downs\u2014to form Toledo\u2019s third-largest depository on June 30. Although Continental IHC\u2019s Eaton sought collaboration, Insull feared losing his control to Morgan\u2019s United PUIHC. To maintain independence, Insull bought Eaton\u2019s voting shares in June. Insull\u2019s PUIHC financed the transaction using intra-system loans and used remaining voting shares as collateral to refinance with loans from New York SBs. Soon, Eaton supported FDR for President against Morgan. Back in 1929, to assure full subscription to new UST bond issues with less market-making, UST allowed holders to earn above-market rates by attaching privileges for old issues to be exchanged for new at par. In addition, while interest income would be exempt from all taxes, gains upon sale before maturity were subject to capital gains. UST eliminated the latter provision in mid-June 1930. At the same time, UST prohibited NBs from pledging assets for state funds. Since Caldwell depended on pledging assets for NBs funds to market tax-exempt municipal bonds, this law made municipal bonds less attractive tax-exempt options relative to UST bonds. Although Caldwell had consolidated for survival in May 1930 with BancoKentucky, a Kentucky BHC, she continued losing liquidity as stocks depreciated and depositors ran, likely due to Tennessee\u2019s 1877 domestic creditor preference. While Nashville\u2019s clearinghouse and FRS Saint-Louis deemed Caldwell\u2019s loans well secured, they supported the state banking regulator in placing Caldwell\u2019s affiliated NB into receivership in November. At that point, Tennessee\u2019s governor vowed to protect state funds. As merger talks with TransAmerica broke down, receivers took over Caldwell, Banco claimed her merger never consummated, and both banks\u2019 correspondents lost liquidity to satisfy depositor demands without their market-makers.

Like in most states, regulators could only liquidate banks. So, inter-state regulators and bank managers fire sold securities and spun off stabilizing insurance subsidiaries. Municipalities persuaded banks to extend financing as lower tax revenues and growing required outlays to support unemployed laborers. So, banks shortened terms and required expenditure reductions. As banks substituted from private security collateral loans to UST and municipal debt investments, borrowers ran from private securities. FRS neither increased discounts nor could legally discount NYSE securities or MMSEC loans. Since NYSE securities were collateral, MMSEC matched rates for short-seller funds placed as collateral. Brokers used the low stock borrowing rates to balance NYSE. But as states sought to abolish short selling, stock borrowing developed a premium over MMSEC. As brokers could not balance NYSE, NYSE deflated as MMSEC contracted, inflating debt burdens. By September 1930, Hoover appointed WFC\u2019s Eugene Meyer as the first Jewish Governor of FRS to spur the leaderless system\u2014since FRS New York Governor Strong died in 1928\u2014into action. Still, deflating NYSE collateral squeezed Cyrus Eaton and other brokers in October. While NYSE prevented him from using existing Continental IHC funds to buy a private IHC he owned, Continental IHC pledged portfolio securities to borrow money from his IHC. Like with SBs prior to the Panic of 1907, NYCH refused to extend membership to BIHCs. As share prices fell, BOUS attempted to stabilize prices. Although most bank failures of late 1930 were related to Caldwell, rumors sparked a run from one of BOUS\u2019 branches. In the last quarter of 1930, deposits of Jewish BOUS and Manufactures Trust BIHCs fell by a third as those of Morgan\u2019s Guaranty Trust and Rockefeller-affiliated Citi and Chase rose rapidly. As New York City\u2019s mayor sued to protect city money, FRS New York refused to discount mortgages and sought to merge BOUS, Manufactures Trust, and two other Jewish bankers. Possibly still blaming Jews for the death of his father, John Morgan Jr refused to extend aid through NYCH. After BOUS\u2019 BIHC filed for voluntary equity receivership, BOUS paid out over 80% of deposits, with losses falling on Jewish merchants in New York and European, and several executives were imprisoned. And as her IHC flopped, Goldman sold Manufacturers Trust to Morgan and Rockefeller, who replaced the founder with Irish Catholic Horace Flanigan as VP, who had married a Busch of the Saint-Louis brewer Anheuser Busch family.

As Weinberg rebuilt the firm, he hired Bernard Baruch\u2019s cousin Edgar Baruch, who built up the firm\u2019s trading arbitrage practice with Gustave Levy. As Kidder struggled, Edwin Webster\u2014son Kidder\u2019s former CEO and scion of Boston Brahmin Stone Webster electric engineering consultants\u2014appealed to Morgan\u2019s George Whitney to reorg the firm. By March 1931, Morgan and Webster injected equity. Along with Webster, his Harvard classmate Albert Gordon joined Kidder\u2019s board from Goldman. Although there were more Black banks in Virginia and the South, the Northern Black banks in Chicago and Philadelphia were much larger. Since the Panic of 1925, Richard Wright\u2019s Citizens & Southern became the only Black bank in Philadelphia. And as Binga turned to fraudulent credit in Chicago, the Chicago bank clearinghouse refused to lend to his insolvent bank, and the Illinois\u2019 bank examiner closed Binga in November 1930, leaving Douglass NB as Chicago\u2019s sole Black bank. Binga was imprisoned for embezzlement. Against competition from White Richmond banks, Maggie Walker consolidated her bank with two other Black-owned banks in 1930. By 1931, she became board Chair of the combined bank until her death in 1934.

In January 1931, however, the Court revoked this decision and allowed UST to tax dividends paid out.

Still, Chicago\u2019s foreclosures accelerated. Meanwhile, Philadelphia stockbroker Henry Kirkbride liquidated via a voluntary bankruptcy after the founder died. Using the land mortgage decision, the district court prevented Morgan and other secured lenders from selling the pledged collateral without her permission on June 10th. As loan collateral risk increased, NYSE issued more rules against shorting. Although depositors ran from Chatham Phenix NB and BOUS-type banks affiliated with depreciating BIHCs, two-thirds of American bank suspensions and deposits remained in Toledo and Chicago between April and August. Despite IHC share prices depreciating faster and below their underlying stock values, few IHCs failed as other IHCs and investors bought their shares. The most important of these purchasers was Floyd Odlum\u2019s Atlas, which bought the BIHC controlling the Empire State Building from Chatham Phenix NB in August. Likewise, Atlas acquired Hayden Stone affiliated Sterling IHC. Likewise, Atlas\u2019 invested Becker\u2019s IHC in return for investment. As Atlas and other firms exchanged stock for shares in funds trading at significant discounts, she underwrote securities and reorganized debt and management. Similarly, BIHC and PUIHC continued to reinforce one another.

In the coal entrep\u00f4t of Toledo, Security-Home SB stockholders\u2019 equity was wiped out by June, even though the excess liabilities were half of the shrinkage allowance. So, Ohio\u2019s banking regulator placed the FRS-nonmember SB\u2014without assistance from the WFC, Toledo\u2019s bank clearinghouse, or more mergers\u2014into receivership. This decision precipitated a run from similar banks, forcing them to close after failing to merge within the 60-day stay\u2014and accelerated the local deflation. As bankruptcies negated bank mortgage assets, B&Ls and other nonbanks took over as real estate creditors. While Texas\u2019 antitrust law of 1889 blocked OIL and prohibited natural gas burning, ruinous competition hordes resumed consolidations and output controls. After Texas courts struck down TRC\u2019s pools in late July 1931, Oklahoma\u2019s governor used state troops to limit oil production and burn gas in August. As he moved to seize PUHCs\u2019 pipes, Tri Utilities filed for receivership. Upon the failure, FTC resumed investigations, and state regulation grew. New York Governor FDR established PUHC restrictions and federal PUs in his election platform, increasing appropriation risks. As operating PUs decreased dividends, PUHC securities deflated, forcing Insull and other PUHCs to meet margin calls. So, the PUHCs pledged additional operating company shares as bank loan collateral to peg share prices, pay dividends, and support weaker segments.

That same year, Wistar\u2019s daughter married William Morrow Roosevelt, nephew of Roosevelt\u2019s Nicholas Roosevelt. Concluding that short-term pound liabilities exceeded assets in July, the Macmillan Report recommended devaluation and tariffs, starting the European Panic of 1931.

That same year, Wistar\u2019s daughter married William Morrow Roosevelt, nephew of Roosevelt\u2019s Nicholas Roosevelt. Concluding that short-term pound liabilities exceeded assets in July, the Macmillan Report recommended devaluation and tariffs, starting the European Panic of 1931. As German creditors repatriated gold from London following the Standstill Agreement, Parliament sought to increase already high taxes on September 11th. Fearing similar taxes as bankers and Congress blamed the Panic of 1929 on capital gains, Americans sold securities to realize capital losses while they could. As Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general allowed solvent banks to secure public funds deposits with pledged assets the same day, UST allowed banks to account for investment-grade debt at cost the following day. UST bond yields increased as Europeans sold American assets to repatriate gold after the British suspension on September 20th. Although NYSE opened unlike most exchanges, she instituted a complete short-selling ban for two days. As the prohibition included brokers, stock prices inflated. After international exchanges reopened, NYSE increasingly limited short starting from October. Still, gold outflows continued pushing up inflation and UST debt yields. While FRS hiked interest rates, pressure on UST to increase taxes grew. With debt markets collapsing, corporate defaults increased. Without assistance from FRS Cleveland, Pittsburgh NBs chose receivership after inter-state correspondents ran from them. As with banks, the receivers\u2019 fire sales of brokers\u2019 loans secured with illiquid Curb collateral spread margin calls to borrowers with similar collateral. Starting in September, bank runs spread from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago through October. Amidst the runs, Union Trust of Cleveland sold repurchase agreements to New York\u2019s Guaranty Trust, Citi, and Bankers Trust. While President Hoover and FRS Governor Meyer encouraged NYCH and other major banks to organize a bank consortium National Credit Corp (\u201cNCC\u201d) and broaden discounts and increase liquidity, fears of exchange suspension accelerated a cycle of security sales and collateral loan margin calls, forcing HC reorgs. TransAmerica\u2019s Giannini made Elisha Walk Chair and his friend Jean Monnet board Vice Chair after buying Blair and Hellman\u2019s banks in California in 1930. Unable to monetize their mortgage assets, Walk and Monnet tried to sell Bank of America to Citi in 1931 and liquidate TransAmerica BIHC in early 1932, Giannini forced them to resign after winning the proxy fight. Since short-selling stocks in 1929, Texan Robert Young acquired a controlling interest in Morgan\u2019s Alleghany RIHC, including Chesapeake & Ohio RR, in 1931. Refusing to share his plans with Morgan and accused the firm of manipulating railroad sales to their benefit. Young retained Lehman as his banker. But as railroad financing fell, so did sales, leading Pittsburgh\u2019s steel industry relied on Detroit automobiles. In November, the Court reverberated that UST could tax payouts\u2014including insolvent company reorgs\u2014unlike Kerbaugh-Empire. Even HC reorgs from 1928 and 1929 may have been taxable with this decision. The same month, NYCH taxed nonbank corporations to force them out of MMSEC.

FA32 temporarily expanded FRS discountable securities to include UST bonds and promissory notes. But while New York SBs lent the receipts from FRS New York\u2019s purchases to Chicago on stock collateral, FRS New York sunset purchases by April as her gold depleted. Kreuger sold Swedish Ericsson telephony to IT&T, but IT&T withdrew after an audit. Ivar Kreuger turned to Swedish banks but died in March 1932. While possibly murdered, most assumed suicide. Swedish receivers left little for the IHC as they fire sold assets. Having paid scrip since 1931, Chicago suspended payments to city workers indefinitely. PUs and banks advanced taxes. Still, FRS Chicago could not afford to increase discounts. As New York declared a moratorium for solvent railroads from bond downgrades retroactive to 1930, allowing banks and insurance companies to invest unless the railroad firms defaulted. So, insurers bought more railroad and UST bonds. Although PU operators had some protections like railroads, PUHCs did not. They suffered as capital market yields spiked amid falling UST bond and money market yields. While banks sold collateral when a Boston-based PUIHC defaulted, the IHC survived. Others forced investors to subscribe to debt reorgs. However, as Insull\u2019s PUIHC pledged voting shares, banks forced them into receivership after the PUIHC failed to meet margin calls on May 15, 1932. Some blamed Morgan. The Court reiterated her stance against non-railroad receiverships instead of liquidation the next day in a separate case. Despite RFC\u2019s rescue attempt, Anthony Overton\u2019s Douglass NB of Chicago, the first Black-controlled institution to become a NB, failed on May 26. While investment banks oversaw receiverships, they hired management consultants to assist them in reorgs and strategy. Starting in the 1920s, McKinsey, Booz, and Arthur Anderson remained small. By May 28, Insull\u2019s operating PU boards called on James Simpson to lead them through the crisis. Simpson had chaired and owned retailer Marshall Field, an affiliate of Chicago\u2019s main bank, Continental Illinois NB. As Simpson left, Marshall Field hired James McKinsey, Head of McKinsey, as Chair until his death in 1937. Around the same time, Sewell Avery\u2014an extended cousin of the Morgan and Rockefeller families\u2014of SB & Trust Co in Evanston, Illinois, helped fund Booz, which conducted surveys for Avery\u2014including his bank, Gypsum, and Montgomery Ward\u2014and other Chicago businesses. Also on May 28th, Illinois\u2019 district court shocked bankers by prohibiting New York SBs from selling collateral in the bankruptcy of Insull\u2019s PUIHC. While Chicago defaulted on her June 1st bond obligations, local banks covered the payment. Within days, Atlas bid on a dozen BIHC minority investments. One of her purchases was the Chicago-domiciled PUIHC that held London\u2019s PU, Britain\u2019s largest. Although UST yields fell in March, Congress enacted TA32 on June 6, limiting NOCs, capping capital losses to offset gains, and taxing intra-HC dividends. Since debt interest remained tax-exempt, investors ran from equity to debt. And as TA32 taxed bank checks, depositors ran from banks to transact with untaxed currency.
