Names of people are not italicized, but firm names are and do not use definite articles. Some other institutional proper nouns are also italicized. Acronyms are generally not italicized. Descendancy is usually direct. Cousinhood is often of the first order, unless a surname, then usually implies several marriages between the surnamed families. Middle names are either maternal or maiden surnames. Some surnames have been changed for differentiation from others (e.g., Smith to Smyth).

The terminology of panics is imprecise for various reasons. Robert Rubin, reflecting on his experience as Secretary of United States Treasury (“UST”) after co-chairing Goldman Sachs, said that “I avoided using words such as ‘panic’ and ‘meltdown’, preferring less vivid terms such as ‘contagion’ and ‘loss of confidence.’ I’d learned while working in the White House as director of the National Economic Council (NEC) that the words public officials use can make an enormous difference, and that was even truer at the Treasury.” (Rubin, 2003). In the foundational work in quantitative economic history, Conrad and Meyer (1964) observe that: “In much of our literature, the preconceptions about variations in growth rates are obvious in the terminology. 19th century economists spoke

In the foundational work in quantitative economic history, Conrad and Meyer (1964) observe that: “In much of our literature, the preconceptions about variations in growth rates are obvious in the terminology. 19th century economists spoke of panics and crises. Few people in the ‘30s, however, wrote about the ‘panic of 1929’; by then, the profession had learned that it was studying cycles. Since WWII we have changed our focus once again. We are concerned with the problems of development and sustained growth; we tend to look for ‘breakthroughs’, ‘takeoffs’, and ‘big pushes.’” Does this theory imply that ‘panics’ often occur alongside technological advancements and are of secondary importance to other government objectives? That is probably not the case. There have always been and will always be panics in the financial markets. For example, Allen (1887) chronicles a 33 CE bankruptcy law that collapsed Rome’s money market, which had little to do with technological advance. Panics encompass a range of events, from bank crises to credit crunches, housing busts, and stock market crashes. While the economic cost of panics may increase debt defaults, unemployment, and tax defaults, the impact of economic crises varies. As credit and housing busts can extend recessions, bank panics may destabilize the political order. Given the lack of consensus available immediately on the cause of panics, politicians typically appeal to emotions, rather than facts. The allegories that grow out of panics are the main factors molding political and social systems. It is often easier to blame bankers and politicians. So, voter preferences shift to greater state control after panics. Though production drops are usually short-lived, the cycle of political extremism continues to reshape legislation for a considerably longer period. Several of the seminal studies exploring the causes and consequences of panics include Friedman and Schwartz’s Monetary History (1963), Kindleberger’s Manias, Panics, & Crashes (1975), and Reinhart’s This Time is Different (2011). These works alternately attribute panics to monetary policy, banker greed, or market irrationality. One reason for this is that information about banks only becomes public and interesting enough for the media during panics. But if bad or irrational business decisions are omnipresent, monetary policy is the central factor of panics for otherwise functional markets. According to Friedman in 1963, “Inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon.” And again in 1978, saying “the political establishment tried to prolong the happy glow by attributing the acceleration of inflation to special events—bad weather, food shortages, labor union intransigence, corporate greed, the OPEC cartel, or any straw at which they could grasp.” While monetary policy can contract economies to end inflation, panics often have

banks only becomes public and interesting enough for the media during panics. But if bad or irrational business decisions are omnipresent, monetary policy is the central factor of panics for otherwise functional markets. According to Friedman in 1963, “Inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon.” And again in 1978, saying “the political establishment tried to prolong the happy glow by attributing the acceleration of inflation to special events—bad weather, food shortages, labor union intransigence, corporate greed, the OPEC cartel, or any straw at which they could grasp.” While monetary policy can contract economies to end inflation, panics often have different root causes. Under the gold standard, for example, central banks increased interest rates to prevent gold outflows following panics. Similarly, policies implemented after the initial panic can either exacerbate the crisis or redirect economic activity. These policy shifts are sensitive to disruption and contribute to a continuous regulatory cycle. For its role in panics, monetary policy holds a unique place in democracy. To prevent political interference, most countries have established a separation between central bank monetary policy and executive government control. Few agencies can challenge the party in power as much as central banks. This differentiates credit from other public interests such as climate, health, and trade. Like coal regions support mining to increase low-skill jobs, high capital and low labor oil and gas investments cut prices. While scientists continue to debate whether hydro-carbons cause climate change or politics manufacture climate emergencies, private energy always competes on the political and social stage. While there have been numerous books written on the Panic of 2007, relatively few years have passed compared to when the Panic of 1929 was covered by Galbreath (1980), Wigmore (1985), and Wicker (1996). Surprisingly, most of the latter do not discuss law, energy policy, or any demographic or geographic factors. While Wigmore’s study on American securities markets in the four years from 1929 investigated industries, it was only for 6 out of 760 pages. Over six decades after the event, Wicker’s academic work was the first to identify bank failures with just three regions. Unfortunately, much of the panic literature focuses on the effects and responses to panics without providing historical or legal context. Part of this has to do with how academia and publishers compartmentalize disciplines, fracturing our understanding of panics and society. But while policymakers use the law & economics approach to curb inflationary protectionism, economists often ignore the difficult-to-quantify law. Monetary policy seems to clearly have been to blame for the inflation of 1624. Speaking of Habsburg Spanish Emperor Philip IV, Earl Hamilton, (1934) notes “In the first five years after his accession, the output was enormous. But, as has almost always happened in similar cases, the resultant monetary disorder was attributed to malfeasance, particularly by foreigners, rather than to defective monetary policy.” The ‘foreigners’ were mostly Jews and Protestants, such as the Dutch, who were at war with Spain. However, investigating economic crises across the Long 17th century, Parker and Smith (1985)

IT may allow those who know most to refocus operations and reduce equity research, accounting, and legal expenses by outside investors. Perhaps the most likely reason for enforcement, as a DBL executive said in 1985, points to profits: ‘[IT is] a real problem... the premature moves in stocks... can screw up deals and cause them to be canceled.” As IT slowed deals, SEC required outsider disclosure until the Court stopped it in 1980. Although IT presented no harm to either sellers or bidders, SEC upheld the public interest principle that investor trust would keep the 1930s from reoccurring. While a viable theory of harm would not be invented until 1988, IT remained legal for policy makers, including members of Congress and FRS, for many decades. But while DBL dominated takeovers in the 1980s, they faced competition from bankers like Lazard and Goldman, where junior bankers also engaged in IT with insider lawyers from Sullivan Cromwell, with outsider investors. While most attorney generals and media outlets could benefit from apprehending culprits, mistakes are not necessarily illegal, and courts often find it challenging to establish fraudulent wrongdoing. The dividing line between acceptable and inexcusable behavior is difficult to define, particularly when it comes to fraud. Even successful attempts to hold wrongdoers accountable, like the prosecutions of trusts and electric utilities in the 1930s or DBL’s Milken and inside traders in the 1980s, ultimately ended with exculpation. Companies may not always follow legislative intentions, but Congress can quickly amend laws to address loopholes and unintended consequences. As private interests often influence public policy, raising questions about the motivations behind different policy approaches. Is it corruption that drives one approach over another? Enron’s political connections, for example, did not shield them from regulators or the ability to offload toxic investments in the Panic of 2001. Despite their political power and dominance of funding LBO takeovers, Milken resigned after aggressively pursuing IT at DBL, precipitating the Panic of 1989. Giuliani became Mayor of New York and the country slid into a recession; the courts exculpated Milken. Likewise, Americans were furious after the Panic of 2007. While the right refused to bail out borrowers, the left demanded appropriation of ill-gotten gains and imprisonment of bankers. Was there dishonesty and fraud in banks in the years before 2007? Did they differ from other periods or industries? Perhaps pay packages attracted sociopaths. However, police departments and politics still attract sociopaths without pay. Keeping greed out of banking concentrates sociopathy in the unregulated sector—private equity and technology—or, worse yet, public policy. While Giuliani secure a pardon for Milken as President Trump’s personal lawyer in 2020, both Giuliani and Trump were indicted in 2023 alleging criminal conspiracy to keep Trump in office. Beyond irony, political capitalism drives policy volatility. Sociology “So long as Isaac of York trusted his brother Jacob of Marseilles”, one historian wrote of Jews of the Middle Ages, “and both of them trusted their cousin Joseph of Jerusalem, all three stood to make a profit.” Like nepotism

While Giuliani secure a pardon for Milken as President Trump’s personal lawyer in 2020, both Giuliani and Trump were indicted in 2023 alleging criminal conspiracy to keep Trump in office. Beyond irony, political capitalism drives policy volatility. Sociology “So long as Isaac of York trusted his brother Jacob of Marseilles”, one historian wrote of Jews of the Middle Ages, “and both of them trusted their cousin Joseph of Jerusalem, all three stood to make a profit.” Like nepotism in private transactions, “crony capitalism” centralizes informal relationships in government dealings can ensure trust and align long term interests. But like fraudsters can exploit trust for greed or to conceal mistakes, so can politicians label informal arrangements as sinister and corrupt. Corruption is a natural result when panics follow policy actions under political bias. The customary understanding of corruption confines it within strict legal definitions, predominantly associating it with the state and public sectors, failing to recognize its broader entrenchment within cultural norms and its pervasive presence across both public and private domains (Rocha et al., 2011). Elites play a significant role in policy making. Traditional perspectives often portray society as a hierarchical pyramid, presenting a straightforward structure with elites perched at the summit and the general populace relegated to the base. This oversimplification disregards the intricate interplay and dynamic nature of social relationships and networks (Woods, 1998). As such relationships are often familial, conventional views similarly cast nepotism in a uniformly negative light, neglecting to acknowledge potential variations between beneficial and detrimental instances (Bellow, 2004). Indeed, Bellow emphasizes the continued prevalence in America of familial traditions and nepotism across different societal spheres such as the military, religious institutions, and labor unions. Unlike the entertainment industry, where celebrities are widely recognized, few voters can readily name current or historical minority bankers and industrialists. “As Ferguson [2010] warns in his introduction, it is hard to write about bankers and financiers. For all their importance, what they do on a day-to-day basis is rarely good raw material for drama except, of course, during crises like the one we have just lived through—and nothing dates faster or reads more dryly than financial coups of previous decades.” (New York Times Book Review, 2010). To avoid perpetuating stereotypes and potential political backlash, authors often omit discussions about the backgrounds of policymakers, financiers, and industrialists. Nevertheless, these omissions lead to incomplete accounts and may obscure the underlying historical context and policy decisions. A gender-focused perspective, for example, sheds light on the unique role of women in finance and investment, differentiating performance from cultural and policy influences. Similarly, examining other minority lenses can enhance our understanding of economic developments, better prepare us for the future, and humanize minority capitalists as an alternative narrative to the rising anti-capitalist sentiments. Throughout history, religions have often bound dominant social groups to the land as serfs or, in regions without cattle,

with many bearers of rabbinical surnames remaining unaware of their names’ historical connections to their professions. Beyond the second generation, relationships between fathers and sons or between brothers often struggled. A notable exception is the Rothschild family, who first benefited the simultaneous presence of five brothers across five international financial centers. In the second generation, 14 out of 18 marriages occurred within the Rothschild family, followed by 13 out of 30 in the subsequent generation. According to another estimate, half of the Rothschild family’s 58 weddings were intermarriages over the 19th century were among family members, ensuring the continuation of their inheritance and lineage. Among Rothschild’s earliest agents, including Mendelssohn in Prussia and Frankel and Gunzburg in Russia, and Samuel Phillips in Brazil, Davidzon in San Francisco, Joseph in New York, Wagg, and d’Worms of Ceylon were descendants and in-laws of the Katzenellenbogen (“Katz”) family. One of Judaism’s holiest dynasties, the Kohanim Katz claim descent from King David. Rosenstein (1976) offers valuable this lineage. Unlike most descendances in Judaism and in this book, Katz-descendancy may be a maternal bloodline as even husbands from esteemed religious and banking families often adopted their wives’ Katz surnames. Moreover, not all Katz are Katzenellenbogen. Per Dietz (1907), “Katz, also Cahn and Cohen, originally not the designation for a specific family, but the tribal designation for every priestly family (Katz = Cohen Zedek = the righteous priest), which is why, for example, the priestly families Gans, Spanier, Straus are also called Katz. However, the family that had the fixed family name Katz around 1800 can be traced back to the butcher (Kazef) Salomon Katz, who lived around 1710.” “Katz” in this work usually refer to the major branches of the Katz family. Such descendancy has been ascertained using Neil Rosenstein or a link to Meir Katz, Maharam of Padua using genealogical website Geni.com. References that note uncertain lineage of Katz are possibly Koehn-Zadeks.) While the Katz lineage is well-documented, the strategic nature of their marriages and relationships is often overlooked without proper historical context. Katz-descendants, aside from their financial acumen, also lent credibility to various ventures. For instance, in inter-war Germany, the founder of Danat, Jakob Goldsmith, initially faced rejection by a converted Jewish banker but later secured a contract with Ludwig Katz. However, a 1929 fraud scandal involving Ludwig raised questions about the ‘unlimited trust in management.’ While the Katz family’s influence waned after the Holocaust, some cousins, including Rothschild, Kuhn Loeb (“Kuhn”), and Lazard, continued shaping finance. The Katz also intermarried with families that were regionally powerful. Meyer’s Goudchaux Berr Wolff Marx clan of Nancy (2016) chronicles some of the many Judeo-French politicians and banking families who trace their descendance to four families of Protected Jews allowed to settle in Nancy following the Panic of 1720, including Rothschild, Lazard, and many others. More esteemed than Protected Jews were the Court Jews, particularly descendants of Imperial Court Jews of Habsburg Austria, Samuel Oppenheim and Samson Wertheim.

More esteemed than Protected Jews were the Court Jews, particularly descendants of Imperial Court Jews of Habsburg Austria, Samuel Oppenheim and Samson Wertheim. Like New York Times wedding announcements and obituaries for America in the 20th century, Wachstein (1912) documents family histories from inscriptions in ornate Viennese graves. Although sources are generally scattered, a few compendia help highlight patters (such as Richter (1994) and Stern (1992)). While literate Jews have long compiled genealogies, endogamous marriages play a crucial role universally in building trust networks, shaping skills, and influencing preferential laws. Historical examples of this practice include the descendants of Confucius in China, upper and trading castes in Hindu India, and the descendants of the family of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad in Yemen. Religion tied together social, commercial, and political law. While Islam tolerated usury more than Christianity, it placed greater restrictions on female entrepreneurship compared to Hindu commercial castes. Although Hinduism promoted widows to commit suicide, Islam allowed remarriage. In Shia Islam, daughters could inherit without sons, while egalitarian Sunnis favored male cousins. While Jews, Christians, Japan, and Germany followed primogeniture, Islam, China, Russia, Vietnam, India, and France practiced partible inheritance. After centuries of development, revolution, and cultural cross-pollination, the attitudes of these societies to capitalism remain similar. From the Middle Ages through the 19th century, Christian moral teachings and social hierarchy shaped distrust toward profit-making and lending. Overtime, lending through merchant banking gained acceptance and status due to its ties to elite families and foreign finance. For centuries, Arabian society was structured into distinct clans and castes, with nobility at the apex. Tribal leaders, known as sheikhs, maintained their elevated status by marrying their daughters to sheikhs of other tribes and only accepting marriages from noble families. This practice broke the customary standards of kin and tribal endogamy. Likewise, Polish Historian Marek Minakowski argues that most Poles of peasant descent are unlikely to have Jewish ancestors, as the two groups historically lived alongside rather than integrated with each other, especially due to cultural and legal barriers. Intermarriage was more plausible among the nobility or intelligentsia. From Ottoman Turkey, across the Mediterranean, and in the leading cities of Europe, Sturdza (1999) traces the how the Rodocanachi and their banking cousinhood descended from the ancient kings of Armenia and Greek Byzantine Imperial Palaiologos family. Among Anglo-American financiers and other plutocrats, descent from Emperor Charlemagne appears so common in genealogical records that it can, in many cases, be reasonably assumed after a generation or two of prominence. Arguably more important is the ability to trace this ancestry than its existence. Along with aristocratic

Among Anglo-American financiers and other plutocrats, descent from Emperor Charlemagne appears so common in genealogical records that it can, in many cases, be reasonably assumed after a generation or two of prominence. Arguably more important is the ability to trace this ancestry than its existence. Along with aristocratic descendancy, non-conformist religion united bankers. In Britain, Quakers played a pivotal role in driving banking and industrialization during the Napoleonic Wars. Despite the subsequent success of American Quakers, Baltzell (1979) concludes that Boston replaced Philadelphia as America’s financial center. Notable figures in this transition were Jay Gould and John Morgan. One of Morgan’s ancestors, Reverend Thomas Hooker, founded Connecticut Colony. His granddaughter married James Pierpont, a descendant of Charlemagne, who became the Pastor of New Haven, Connecticut, and one of the three ministers who co-founded Yale. Their grandson began lawyering in the 1810s but ordained in the clergy. His daughter later married banker Junius Morgan, the grandson of a Unitarian minister. Before John Davison Rockefeller founded Standard Oil (“OIL”), his third great-grandfather, Solomon Morgan Avery, a descendant of Charlemagne, was a grantee of Chiswick, New Hampshire, and a proprietor of Susquehanna Land Co, which settled the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania after America’s Revolution. While Solomon married the daughter of the Reverend of New Haven, her sister wed a Pierpont, the brother-in-law of Reverend Hooker’s second great-granddaughter. Solomon’s son inherited over 1,000 acres along Tunkhannock Creek and served as justice of the peace and colonel of militia. A daughter of Solomon’s other son married the great-grandson of Johann Rockefeller, who immigrated from Germany around 1723 and acquired large landholdings in New Jersey. It was thought that Solomon’s second great granduncle was John Morgan’s forefather, but this relationship may be more distant. Morgan soon joined other Protestants to organize Bankers Trust in 1903. The driving force was Henry Pomeroy Davison, an extended cousin of the Avery family and John Davison Rockefeller. Born to a family of bankers and Presbyterian clergy. Bankers Trust became a ‘bankers’ bank,’ with a board comprised of 12 men from large New York commercial banks, four from out-of-town commercial banks, and three from investment banks. Bankers Trust was led President Edmund Converse, the grandson of a Congregationalist reverend, alongside directors including George Perkins of Morgan, James Blair of Blair, Barton Hepburn of Chase NB, William Porter of Chemical NB, Davison and Thomas Lamont of Liberty NB/First NB of New York, and First NB director William Moore. While William Porter descended from Reverend Hooker, William Moore descended from bankers and Reverend Hooker’s associate, Colonial Connecticut’s Governor John Webster. As Lamont was the son of a Scotch-Irish Methodist minister, Blair had a heritage spanning over six centuries in Scotland, engaged

commercial banks, and three from investment banks. Bankers Trust was led President Edmund Converse, the grandson of a Congregationalist reverend, alongside directors including George Perkins of Morgan, James Blair of Blair, Barton Hepburn of Chase NB, William Porter of Chemical NB, Davison and Thomas Lamont of Liberty NB/First NB of New York, and First NB director William Moore. While William Porter descended from Reverend Hooker, William Moore descended from bankers and Reverend Hooker’s associate, Colonial Connecticut’s Governor John Webster. As Lamont was the son of a Scotch-Irish Methodist minister, Blair had a heritage spanning over six centuries in Scotland, engaged in preaching, teaching, and landownership in America. Davison soon hired Benjamin Strong, who descended from Elder John Strong, who migrated from England to Massachusetts in 1630 and became as a tanner and Puritan church elder. Benjamin Strong’s mother was born to an influential Presbyterian minister. As Hepburn descended from an old Scotch military family and served as Comptroller of the Currency, he soon hired Albert Wiggin, the son of a Unitarian reverend. With Elder Strong as an ancestor, John Morgan descended from of a Unitarian minister and Reverend John Cotton, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne. Morgan’s private bank partners (“Morgan”) operated as family units per Pak (2013). Relying on the support and alliances of the Puritan ‘Boston Brahmin’ community, Morgan did not add partners of Jewish heritage until several decades after WWII. Instead, Morgan’s most prominent partner—Anthony Drexel—had converted to Episcopalism from Catholicism. After becoming a Morgan a Partner, Edward Whitney recruited his nephews, George and Richard. When the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 (“FA13”) mandated bankers and brokers separate, George became a Morgan Partner, while Richard served as Morgan’s primary stockbroker. Although Morgan advocated a discretion as a family partnership, another Morgan Partner had an affair with his neighbor. When her husband found out, he killed the wife and committed suicide in 1915. However, media reports did not link Morgan. And when Richard Whitney became mired in scandal for pilfering from Morgan in the 1930s, George remained a Morgan Partner for many more years. While corporations have supplanted many traditional partnerships, familial bonds continue to underpin the worlds of banking and industry. In some cases, these relationships are intricately woven. For instance, after acquiring Kidder Peabody in Boston, Albert Gordon married Mary Rousmaniere in 1934. Her sister, Frances, wed Richard Storrs in 1938, who would later become the Head of securities at the premier law firm Sullivan Cromwell. In Britain, intermarriages between bankers and the aristocracy date back to before World War I, leading to a web of connections that extended across various institutions, including Bank of England, the Conservative party, the Foreign Office, merchant banks, industry, and the media. Although family linkages used to be prominent, with weddings announced in newspapers, the growing sentiment against dynasties and oligarchs has fostered privacy. Privacy of even celebrities is now guarded. However, these interconnections and relationships persist, among long settled and new immigrant communities.

Although family linkages used to be prominent, with weddings announced in newspapers, the growing sentiment against dynasties and oligarchs has fostered privacy. Privacy of even celebrities is now guarded. However, these interconnections and relationships persist, among long settled and new immigrant communities. The ‘bamboo’ network, which has connected Overseas Chinese across Southeast Asia for centuries, continues to link Chinese businesses. James Chao, who fled Chinese Communism to America, maintained a close friendship with his schoolmate Jiang Zemin, who later became the Chinese President in 1989. Chao’s Foremost Shipping utilized ships from Chinese state-owned shipyards with government financing to transport iron ore for state-owned steel makers. Meanwhile, his daughter, Elaine, married Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, serving as the Secretary of Labor in President Bush II’s cabinet in 2001 and becoming the first Asian American woman to hold the position. Jiang’s son Mianheng played a significant role in state-backed investment ventures, including collaborations with companies like Microsoft and Nokia. His other son, Alvin, helped create Boyu Capital, a private equity firm by 2011. McConnell eventually ascended to the role of Senate Republican Majority Leader by 2015. The interplay of familial and business ties extends to various cultural and religious groups. Devout Jains Anshu and Ajit pursued complementary careers, with Ajit heading Berkshire Reinsurance and Anshu marketed derivatives before leading Deutsche Bank. The Sheik Banga family similarly followed a strategic trajectory, with Manvinder Banga leading Unilever before transitioning to a private equity firm, while his brother Ajay worked as a Citi executive before becoming the head of MasterCard in 2010. The family connections continued when Ajay’s daughter was hired by Facebook’s Instagram to lead monetization, and MasterCard formed partnerships with Goldman and Apple in retail banking ventures. Hindu marriages are influenced by caste dynamics, and high-caste Indians have played prominent roles in leading global corporations such as Barclay, Citi, Google, Microsoft, Pepsi, IBM, Adobe, and McKinsey. Notably, by 2020, Kamala Harris, a half-Indian Brahmin, became President Biden’s VP as a Democrat. These networks not only bolster Indian firms like Adani but also influence American investment policies, including Environmental, Social, & Governance (“ESG”) initiatives and alliances across Asia. Amidst the Panic of 2009, European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes attracted attention for her repeated but misguided assertion that ‘Lehman Sisters would not have failed.” She advocated for greater gender diversity on predominantly male corporate boards to reduce risk. (After her term, Kroes became a Special Advisor for Bank of America by 2015). Around the same time, the collapse of Black banks and churches in America laid the groundwork for unprecedented civil rights movements that steer politics and business. These societal shifts carry substantial implications for financial stability and economic development. For instance, the

(After her term, Kroes became a Special Advisor for Bank of America by 2015). Around the same time, the collapse of Black banks and churches in America laid the groundwork for unprecedented civil rights movements that steer politics and business. These societal shifts carry substantial implications for financial stability and economic development. For instance, the shift towards pro-consumer credit policies and regulatory changes have prompted creditors to redirect their focus from retail customers to private capital and family offices. Many of the affluent depositors departing traditional banks are part of global networks of ‘middlemen minorities.’ Newer institutions and associations, such as elite universities like Harvard and Stanford, have attracted students and investors, creating a bridge from the Boston Brahmin to Silicon Valley. But while Sam Bankman-Fried benefited from his family’s connections with these universities and engaged them in his political capitalism, his collapse systemically spread disrepute to his family and other associates. Such risks became evident in the aftermath of the downfall of Indonesia’s dictator, Suharto, as investors ran from associated businesses. Perhaps the most important financial association of this era is McKinsey. Since the 1930s, regulatory changes limiting bank oversight over industry have paved the way for the dominance of consulting firms, particularly McKinsey. While McKinsey itself does not accept deposits, it operates trust networks that significantly impact the global economy. A long list of companies led by McKinsey alumni includes American Express, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Swiss Bank Corp Warburg, Lehman Brothers, HSBC, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch, Lazard, Credit Suisse, Unicredito, Enron, Johnson & Johnson, Viant, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, and Alphabet. Despite these associations, it’s essential to delve deeper to understand the role of financial panics in shaping these changes. Energy Throughout history, societies transformed energy sources. From primitive dependence on human and animal labor to the eventual discovery of novel energy sources, such as natural gas, the journey of energy’s role in human progress is an intriguing one. The story of energy cannot be told without the enigmatic natural gas. The word ‘gas’ itself, with etymological connections to the spectral and supernatural, is emblematic of its mysterious origins. In ancient times, the province of Sichuan in China harnessed natural gas for heating purposes. This early utilization of natural gas in Sichuan is believed to have played a role in potentially delaying China’s industrial revolution, raising questions about the profound influence of energy choices on societal progress. The allure of gas extends to mythology and ancient practices. It intoxicated the Pythia of Delphia, the oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece, and inspired the fire-breathing Chimera of Lycia. Furthermore, the gas flares of Baku in Persia captivated Zoroaster to establish a religious cult. Byzantium employed it as the secret ingredient for Greek

Merle’s daughter with Isaac, Judith, married Mayer Hirschel, who continued being Mint Jews of Breslau, the thriving trade capital of feudal Catholic Silesia. After the deaths of Isaac Arnstein’s wife in 1723 and Samson Wertheim a year later, Arnstein’s daughter married Emmanuel and Judith Oppenheim’s son in 1725. Arnstein later married the daughter of Merle and Isaac Liebman. Emmanuel’s nephew Moses Oppenheim married Lea Hirschel of Breslau. As successor to Wertheim as Chief Rabbi of Hungary, the Emperor appointed Bernhard Eskeles. Samson Wertheim’s son Wolf became Court Jew of Bavaria and moved to the Imperial City of Augsburg. As Wolf’s sister had wed Lipman Cohen-Behrens’ son, her cousin-in-law was Glikl Goldschmidt’s son had married a daughter of the Court Jew of the Margrave of Bayreuth around northern Bavaria, himself becoming a Court Jew and Land Rabbi of Bayreuth by 1728. And in 1729, Arnstein became Habsburg’s Imperial Court Jew. Over the following decades, his children married his niece-in-law Veronika Pressburger, Samuel Oppenheim’s grandson Emanuel Oppenheim, Benedikt Gomperz’s daughter, and Frankfurt banking heirs Moses Beyfus, Lema Hahn, and Moses Scheuer. Winning the Northern War by 1721, Russian Tsar Peter Romanov monopolized the authority to designate successors. As Isay Liebman moved to Saint-Petersburg, Peter’s niece Anna of Courland retained Court Junker Ernst Biron and coupled with Maurice of Saxony, an illegitimate son of Augustus II of Poland, who claimed Tobago. However, Saint-Petersburg intervened and voided the election, leading Russia’s expedition to shift from the Caribbean to Alaska. After Peter death, his widow Catherine ruled for two years until her death in 1725. As Anna seized the throne, she expelled Jews in 1727 to deflect attention from the growth of Lutherans. Since Liebman gained exemption, silver supplier Zundel Girsh petitioned to stay to honor his contract with Old Believer merchant Andrei Simonov. The Court allowed Girsh to stay until the contract ended. While legalizing a Russian form of bills of exchange, veksels, for merchants in 1729, specifically prohibiting serfs. Blaming Poland for dumping copper coins, the government stopped accepting it as tax payment as early as 1730. But like serfs continued to use veksels, so did low quality coin inflation. Anna’s ascension to the throne in 1730 also redirected focus towards naval power and expansion. Collaborative efforts with Britain in America challenged Spain’s empire, resulting in Russian advances in Alaska, British exploration in the Caribbean and Rio de la Plata in Portuguese Brazil. Despite Anna expulsion of Jews in 1727, Isay Liebman remained Court Jew, facilitating the acquisition of diamonds and jewelry for them, managing the finances of Courland under Biron’s trust, transferring diplomatic funds to Poland in 1733 following the death of Augustus II and the War of the Polish Succession against the former King of Poland Stanislaw Leszczyński and his son-in-law, Louis XV of France. When some Jews built a synagogue and converted to Christianity, Tsarina Anna had them executed. However, Isaac petitioned on behalf of the Jewish community to and obtained permission for Jews to live in Saint-Petersburg and Moscow,

late 18th century, Katz-Landau descendants dominated Jewish life in Opatow. The life-long kahal member, Judah Landau was also a deputy of the Council of Four Lands. By the 1720s, Jewish merchants dissented against the Landaus’ control over communal life. While Pawel Sanguszko’s comptroller accused Judah Landau of not being accountable for negotiating loans and mismanaging kahal funds, Judah’s brother Isaac violated the rule against consecutive terms and controlled kahal elections, leading to tensions and violence in 1726. As the rabbi, Landau enjoyed a tax exemption, and expanded commercial activities after resigning, prompting the kahal to demand tax payment or cease trade. In the kahal election of 1728, critics attempted to curb Landau’s influence, leading Pawel Sanguszko to order a rerun of election, mandate Isaac pay taxes, and restrict Judah’s participation in the regional council. Judah’s death in 1738 triggered a conflict over his son-in-law, whom Sanguszko banished. However, after another violent conflict erupted stemming from Landau’s control of kahal offices and tax distribution in 1744, Sanguszko supported the Landau power monopoly and punished several of their critics. While Landaus remained in power, Judah’s son Ezekiel left to become Rabbi of Yampol. When Karol Radziwill died in 1719, his bequeathed most of his estates to his son Michal and several to his widow, Pawel’s sister Anna Sanguszko Radziwill. Many of Anna’s estates were around Belarus, including Mir, Biala Podlaska, and Sluzk. While Lithuania’s Jewish council separated from Poland in 1623, a council formed with three main communities: Brest, Grodno, and Pinsk. Wilna became the fourth in 1670, and Sluzk joined as the fifth main community in 1691. By then, Katz Wahl-in-law Naftali Gunzburg died after over a decade of service and was replaced by Yitzchak Teomin Frankel, a Katz Wahl descendant and relative of Court Jew Koppel Frankel, who had served as Rabbi of Żolkow before leaving for Pinsk. Teomin Frankel was followed by a Luria-Epstein cousin of the Benveniste-Mendes and a succession of short terms until Yehuda Enzel, whose mother descended from Lemberg’s Rabbi Abraham Rappaport’s cousin. Marrying a Katz-Rappaport, Yehuda served for over a decade until 1722. Following two more short term rabbis, Haim Rappaport, Yehuda’s uncle-once removed and a husband of Luria-Epstein, became Sluzk’s Rabbi from 1730. While Haim’s sons became Rabbi of Glogau and Head of Lemberg’s yeshiva, his daughters married into the Katz and Gunzburg families. As Haim departed Sluzk to be Rabbi of Lemberg in 1740, Yitzhak Teomin Frankel’s grandnephew Isaak took over with the aid of his father-in-law, Shmuel Ickowicz. At the time, Landau and other elite rabbinical families faced competition from Hasidism, started by Katz descendant Rabbi Israel Eliezer (“Baal Shem Tov”), a charismatic miracle worker. Following the destruction of the Northern War, Anna sought to rebuild by leasing Mir and Biala Podlaska in 1726 to brothers Shmuel and Gdal Ickowicz, who left their father’s leasehold in the Radziwill estates of Volhynia. After expanding leases, Shmuel is said to have been inspired by Baal Shem Tov to relocate to Sluzk in 1733, where

1740, Yitzhak Teomin Frankel’s grandnephew Isaak took over with the aid of his father-in-law, Shmuel Ickowicz. At the time, Landau and other elite rabbinical families faced competition from Hasidism, started by Katz descendant Rabbi Israel Eliezer (“Baal Shem Tov”), a charismatic miracle worker. Following the destruction of the Northern War, Anna sought to rebuild by leasing Mir and Biala Podlaska in 1726 to brothers Shmuel and Gdal Ickowicz, who left their father’s leasehold in the Radziwill estates of Volhynia. After expanding leases, Shmuel is said to have been inspired by Baal Shem Tov to relocate to Sluzk in 1733, where he became the Cashier in 1736 and his brother a factor and distillation and mill manager. For trade with Saint-Petersburg, the brothers corresponded directly with Isay Liebman, the Court Jew of Russia. Like Anna, Jewish women played an important role. For example, Michal’s wife had a female agent Malka who sourced kitchen and other supplies for her. During business trips, Shmuel’s entrusted his wife Henia with full authority to negotiate and disburse funds. While Gdal’s wife negotiated and contracted with Jewish merchants of eastern Belarus, his daughter commercially corresponded from Valozhyn. Upon Anna’s retirement in 1740, the brothers worked for her son, Hieronim, eventually leasing all his estates. Along with funding Hieronim’s army training school in Sluzk, the brothers secured rabbinic roles for their family. While Shmuel’s new son-in-law Isaak Teomin Frankel became Rabbi of Sluzk in 1740, a more prestigious post opened in 1741. Upon the baptism of his brother in 1741, prominent Jews called for the resignation of the Rabbi of Krakau, including Chaskiel Landau of Tarnow, Ezekiel Landau of Opatow, and three of the four Jewish leaders of Krakau. While the Landaus claimed the post based on their historical contributions to the leadership of the Jewish community in the region and the lineage of rabbis within their family, Shmuel Ickowicz acquired the post for Teomin Frankel. By 1743, Gdal bought the Wilna rabbinate for his son-in-law Nahman Katz (of unknown lineage). By then, Gdal became Court Jew of Königsberg, Shmuel with Prussian Court Jew Ephraim, and betrothed his daughter to one of Ephraim’s sons. However, Russia’s expulsion of Court Jew Isay Liebman cut off ties with Saint-Petersburg in 1744. Facing mounting debts, Hieronim Radziwill accused the Ickowicz family of embezzlement and seized their Ephraim dowery and Polish and Prussian assets with support from the Landaus. With backing from the King of Prussia, Ephraim paralyzed trade between Hieronim’s estates and the Port of Königsberg with a lien. From Vienna, Isay Liebman called for the release of the Ickowiczs. Despite compromising, Shmuel and his father died after a year in prison. Rabbi Nahman Katz was dismissed from Wilna. Isaak Teomin Frankel, having lost the Sluzk and Krakau rabbinates—the former to a Katz-descendant who wed Haim Rappaport’s niece and the latter to Ezekiel Landau’s cousin—settled in Breslau and later became the Chief Rabbi of Silesia. However, Sluzk’s revenues plummeted. Hieronim’s debts pressed on until he inherited the assets of a

on Jewish marriages. Since the 17th century, Wolf Popper served as the Lords’ Jew for Count Kollowrat of Bresnitz, collecting the Jewish Leibmaut, or body tax, from rural Bohemian Jews. By the late 1720s, he had become Primator of Bohemian rural Jews, granting him residency privileges in Prague’s ghetto. Likewise, Sephardi Diego Aguilar leased Austria’s tobacco monopoly for decades from 1725. After severing as Court Jew for various German states, Wolf Schlesinger’s son took over the Spanish crown debt in 1726. But he died in a year. His brother Marx, meanwhile, parlayed lead, copper, tin, and gunpowder from Poland to Austria via Polish Jewish merchants. As a Court Jew of many princes simultaneously, Samson Wertheim’s son Wolf became the first Court Jew of Bavaria, but faced challenges as the Emperor forced him to lend money and threatened to confiscate Wertheim’s house in 1726. While the loan drove him into insolvency, Wolf continued banking until Bavaria defaulted in 1733 and liquidated loans for two decades. In 1733, the Catholic Duke Karl Alexander took control of Württemberg and hired Court Jew Joseph-Süss Oppenheim—Samuel Oppenheim’s great-nephew and Samson Wertheim’s cousin—who was at that time Chief Minister of Finance & War for the Palatinate and Treasury Agent for spiritual princes of Cologne. To furnish material and grain during Polish-French War, Joseph-Süss ran the Mint of Stuttgart. Likewise, his half-brother converted to Christianity and worked as a Hessian Court factor in Darmstadt. By 1736, Württemberg granted rights for Jewish residents in Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg in 1736 under Joseph-Süss’ authority. However, when Duke Alexander suffered a stroke in 1737, Joseph-Süss’ debtors accused him of embezzlement and fraud. Through four months of arrest and daily interrogations, he refused to convert, and so was hung on the gallows in front of 12,000 onlookers. The same year, Genoa expelled her Jews. Months later, in Vienna, Joseph-Süss’ cousin-in-law Emmanuel Oppenheim’s widow Judith Gomperz died in relative poverty. So did Isaac Oppenheim and his Hirschel wife by 1741. As Isaac Liebman and Merle Schiff Wertheim’s daughter Judith died in 1737, her husband Mayer Hirschel fled Vienna. Hirschel disappeared from Vienna finances. Despite marrying the Court Jew of Saxony Behrend Lehmann’s daughter, another Hirschel left Vienna for Moravia across the Danube River. Likewise, Schlesinger shifted to Berlin as their Vienna lease expired. Since the War of the Spanish Succession, Charles VI’s sister, Archduchess Maria led Belgium and Protestant bankers replaced Court Jews. Viennese Court bankers depended on Jean-Baptiste Cogels and Pietro Proli. After their deaths, their widows took over their banks. While the bankers worked with Mathias Nettine, treasurer of Duke Francis of Lorraine, soon surpassed them. Duke Francis sought to marry Charles VI’s daughter, Maria-Theresa, France feared Habsburg proximity. So, following the loss of War of the Polish Succession, Francis traded Lorraine to French King Louis XV’s father-in-law Stanislaw Leszczyński in exchange for Tuscany in 1736 and married the heiress. However, after Charles VI died in 1740, Bavaria challenged Maria-Theresa’s claim to the German throne in the War of the Austrian

So, following the loss of War of the Polish Succession, Francis traded Lorraine to French King Louis XV’s father-in-law Stanislaw Leszczyński in exchange for Tuscany in 1736 and married the heiress. However, after Charles VI died in 1740, Bavaria challenged Maria-Theresa’s claim to the German throne in the War of the Austrian Succession. Joining Bavaria, Prussia annexed Silesia, referring to Breslau as the ‘Pearl in the Prussian Crown.’ Meanwhile, Gentile bankers grew their networks. In 1729, Leendert-Pieter Neufville a linen merchant descended from Calvinists and Mennonites and related to the Coymans family like Pels, started Neufville bank in Amsterdam. Likewise, Swiss Huguenot merchants established trade links across Europe. As Gontard established in Frankfurt, Bagueret started in Warsaw by 1735, merchants like Ami Dumont and François Leclerc conducted trade in Leipzig. In the War of the Austrian Succession, the British soon called on Johann Fries, the Huguenot son of a Mühlhausen mayor, to supply the troops of Austrian, Dutch, British, and Hanoverian troops in the Netherlands and Belgium. Amidst the global war, Britain called upon her trans-national Jewish bankers. In America, Jacob Franks of New York and his son David of Philadelphia served as contractor agents, supplying British forces in Jamaica in 1740. As his sister wed the American-born James Schuyler DeLancey of Huguenot and Dutch heritage, who was New York’s Chief Justice and soon became Lieutenant-Governor, David Franks married Margaret Evans, the Christian daughter of Pennsylvania’s land deed recorder and sheriff. Since his Hart aunt had died in 1736, another of David’s uncles wed another of Moses Hart’s daughters (a niece of the Chief Rabbi of Britain) in 1743. When France conquered Madras in 1746, Franks’ nephew joined Mordecai Hamburger in loans to EIC. Against the occupiers in 1742, Primator of Bohemian rural Jews Wolf Popper safeguarded the treasury Austria. But as Maria-Theresa ceded most of Silesia, she declared herself Queen of Bohemia and expelled Jews from there in 1745, suspecting some had abetted Prussia. That year, Chief Rabbi of Hungary Bernhard Eskeles married Samson Wertheim’s daughter and retired from Moravia to advocate for Jews. Because Maria-Theresa banned Jews from her Court, Bavarian Court Jew Wolf Wertheim connected Court Jews in other countries to seek diplomatic intervention. As Jacob Frankel of Fürth gained support from the Bishop of Bamberg, Britain’s Moses Hart and Aaron Franks convinced King George II to mobilize his ministers, Christian VI of Denmark wrote personally to the Empress, and representatives of Holland, Turkey’s Sultan, the Chief Bishop of Madrid, and the Elector of Mainz appealed to the Vienna. Delaying until 1746, Vienna, Prague, Buda, and other cities expelled Jews, often using violence and plunder. As war ended two years later, Austria readmitted the Jews to restore public finances.

Delaying until 1746, Vienna, Prague, Buda, and other cities expelled Jews, often using violence and plunder. As war ended two years later, Austria readmitted the Jews to restore public finances. Instead, the Empress Maria-Theresa extended her father’s Free Port of Trieste with legislation specifically attracting Jews from 1746. David Luzzatto and Grassin Levi led the Morpurgo, Parente, Porto, Treves, and Stella families to incorporate with governing statutes and tax collection authority. While Austria collected the Jewish Trieste tax, Sephardi Diego Aguilar saw his Austrian tobacco monopoly from 1725 end before he abruptly left Vienna in 1749 due to Spanish extradition demands, finding refuge in London. In 1751, the central government, municipalities, and officials under the Empress supported Count Blümegen and Baron Neffzern in founding Moravian Loan Bank in Brünn, the first joint-stock private bank in the Habsburg monarchy. The War of the Austrian Succession ended soon after the Austro-French alliance cemented in 1747 with the marriage of the Crown Prince of France and the daughter of Empress Maria-Theresa’s cousin and Saxon Elector Augustus III, who had married in 1719. Instead of Jews, Protestants banked Austria. After Mathias died in 1749, his widow, Barbe Nettine, took over as Belgium’s dominant banker. Within a year, Empress Maria-Theresa summoned Fries to Vienna. Although Fries was Protestant in Catholic Vienna, Fries shifted Austrian finance from Jews. By 1752, Fries marketed a significant portion of the state’s silver thalers. Prohibiting importation of foreign goods, the Empress promoted industrialization of Bohemia. Like her father, she sought to break tradition by promoting Austrian Catholic nobility to invest in industry. Instead of relying on public debt, Britain financed the war by borrowing from BOE, SSC, and EIC. While Smyth subscribed to these issues cautiously, John Smyth served as a director of both SSC and EIC around this time. To participate in this market, West Indies-born Sephardi Samson Gideon married a British Gentile in 1745 to secure his position in British society and financial markets. married a British Gentile in 1745, enhancing his social standing and facilitating his integration into British financial markets. Around the same time, Charles Edward Stuart, grandson of the deposed King James II, gained support from French forces and Jacobite Scottish bankers like Drummond. He landed in Scotland in mid-1745, launching the Jacobite Rebellion. After an initial success, Stuart advanced as far as Derby before retreating to Scotland. He was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, which resulted in panic in London and a run from BOE notes in the Panic of 1745. In response, Mocatta, Gideon, and Dutch financier Theodore Janssen and

He landed in Scotland in mid-1745, launching the Jacobite Rebellion. After an initial success, Stuart advanced as far as Derby before retreating to Scotland. He was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, which resulted in panic in London and a run from BOE notes in the Panic of 1745. In response, Mocatta, Gideon, and Dutch financier Theodore Janssen and British banker John Barnard, worked to stabilize the British credit system by securing Dutch and German capital. Surpassing Continental Court Jews in wealth and influence, providing £1 million to a loan and proposing a subscription for circulating BOE notes in 1747, as Theodore Janssen’s Gentile cousin-in-law married Gideon-allied DaCosta Villareal cousin of the Suassos. Similarly, having linked London’s Dutch and Huguenot communities since marrying the widow of Huguenot financier, Dutch Protestant Gerard Neck banked the East Indies trade until his death in 1750. That year, Gerard’s brother Joshua took over the banking house and refocused on Exchequer debt. As his daughter married Thomas Walpole, a nephew of Robert Walpole, Britain’s first PM, Joshua earned a knighthood in 1751. Since marrying a Gentile in 1745, Gideon had his children baptized and continued to manage British loans through the ongoing wars. In 1757, his daughter married politician Viscount William Gage. However, King George II denied Gideon’s request for a peerage due to his Jewish background. Instead, in 1759, Gideon’s thirteen-year-old son was made a baronet, allowing the family to join the British aristocracy. Similarly, mixed religion firms linked merchants and nobles within France and to Europe. Descended from Sephardi refugees of the Portuguese Inquisition, Jean-Baptiste Silva was born in Bordeaux, and pursued a medical career like his father but converted to Catholicism. Becoming attached to the court, he wed a daughter of the Procureur au Châtelet in 1710. Their daughter later wed the main financier in Limoges. Silva’s brother Gabriel Silva used the royal court connections for his bank, Silva. Originally relying on family in Tonneins and Bayonne, Silva’s Christian correspondents included Pels in Amsterdam and, in Paris, Heusch—a Huguenot who converted to Catholicism—and then the Huguenot Chabbert, which became Mallet. Silva later retained cousin Mendes DaCosta in London and fellow Sephardi Pereire in La Rochelle. Meanwhile, British and Russian forces attempted to gain control of regions in South America, particularly Brazil around 1737. However, due to opposition, conflicts, and lack of support, these plans ultimately failed, leaving Spain’s Indies empire intact. With the end of the War of the Austrian Succession, Britain lost the slave trade asiento, but contra banding made the privilege less of a bargaining chip. The Dutch, allies of the British and Habsburgs, centralized control over their colonies with the aid of Amsterdam-born Isaäc Pinto. Since marrying the daughter of the wealthy Benjamin Nunes Henriques and becoming a

a former Ansbach mint official leased the Leipzig mint for a year in 1752 before passing to merchant banker Christian Frege, the son of a Protestant minister from a Saxon village. Frege expanded into the Polish market against the Frankels. During the Seven Years’ War, the Prussian King Frederick seized the mint and transferred control to Prussian Jewish financiers. After resisting but ultimately losing control, Frege fled and became a war contractor supplying Prussia’s enemies. In 1755, the King of Prussia Frederick began transferring control of the mints in Konigsberg, Breslau, Berlin, Magdeburg, Cleve, and Aurich to private enterprise, spurring competing Mint Jews alliances. A faction led by Frankel and Ephraim vied with the group of Gompertz and Itzig-Jaffe. As an early wartime measure, the Prussian state assumed control of the Leipzig mint, where Ephraim began coining alongside Saxon Court Jew Levis Gerd, his in-law through the Frankels, in January 1757. Following the Battle of Kolin—which destabilized Prussian forces in Saxony—Ephraim fled Leipzig. Along with Berlin, Ephraim branched to Amsterdam. After joining that bank as a bookkeeper in 1755, Naphtali Wessely became a manager. Born in Hamburg, Wessely was a grandson of Issachar Rindskopf of Frankfurt and a cousin of the Oppenheim family. In 1760, he established a bank in Copenhagen. Around then, his Rindskopf cousins of Frankfurt—Simon and Beer Nehm Rindskopf—founded Rindskopf bank that quickly gained prominence through partnerships with Frankel of Fürth, Wertheim in Vienna, Halle in Hamburg, Gomperz and Mendes in Amsterdam, and the Symons and Glogau families. Amidst the war, Prussia’s Court & Protected Jew Act of 1750 and Silesian development fostered German collaborations with neutral Amsterdam and Poland, under the rule of Saxon King Augustus III. In 1758, Boas nephew-in-law Simon Symons of Amsterdam married a daughter of Silesian linen merchant Marx Glogau of Oder. Likewise, Samuel Zbytkower, born near Silesian Czestochowa, moved from Oder to Praga outside of Warsaw by 1757, where he married heiresses from Poland and then Breslau. He initially traded thread, ribbons, and yard goods, later expanding into cattle, grain, and other commodities and becoming Warsaw’s only merchant to serve as the King’s Commissaire in 1766. The Catholic Habsburgs of Austrian depended on Vienna’s Huguenot Court Banker Fries during the Seven Years War, who managed French subsidies and loans totaling amounts unknown since Samuel Oppenheim, soon taking charge of commercializing state mines. Fries’ dominance in government finance was attributed to strong foreign connections, particularly with bank houses in the Austrian Netherlands, Dutch, and Italian correspondents. His relationship with the banking house of Widow Nettine of Brussels played a crucial role in Austrian foreign borrowing from 1756. Around 1757, Nettine’s eldest daughter married General Receiver Adrien Walckiers, who was then promoted to Councilor of State and Robe and Grand Bailiff of Termonde. Although both were ‘working’ overtime during this inflationary period, Barbe Nettine maintained her near monopoly of Belgian lotteries and coin mints by thwarting plans for a public note-issuing Belgian bank. Meanwhile, Nettine saw the rise of another female dealmaker, Jeanne-Antoinette

foreign connections, particularly with bank houses in the Austrian Netherlands, Dutch, and Italian correspondents. His relationship with the banking house of Widow Nettine of Brussels played a crucial role in Austrian foreign borrowing from 1756. Around 1757, Nettine’s eldest daughter married General Receiver Adrien Walckiers, who was then promoted to Councilor of State and Robe and Grand Bailiff of Termonde. Although both were ‘working’ overtime during this inflationary period, Barbe Nettine maintained her near monopoly of Belgian lotteries and coin mints by thwarting plans for a public note-issuing Belgian bank. Meanwhile, Nettine saw the rise of another female dealmaker, Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson. Following the War for the Spanish Succession in 1715, Poisson’s father Francois bought the office of Secretary to the King, becoming a first degree noble. His marriage in 1718 to the daughter of the meat supplier to the Parisian Hôtel des Invalides in Paris was witnessed by the Pâris brothers, prominent financiers, and Claude Blanc, Minister of War under the Regency of Philippe d’Orleans. In 1727, he left France for an extended period in Germany, during which General Receiver Charles-François Normant took on a protective role for his family. While Normant arranged Jeanne-Antoinette to marry his nephew in 1741, she became King Louis XV’s mistress in 1745 with Normant’s encouragement. More than a financial instrument, Poisson herself became actively involved in domestic and international finance. Along with dealing behind the scenes, she was a patron of Pierre DuPont, whose essay on landed capitalism she financed. Born to Anne Monchanin, of a formerly wealthy French family impoverished by their commitment to the Huguenot faith, and Samuel DuPont, a Rouen watchmaker and one of eleven children from a modest home, DuPont later became involved in French finances. She also favored Etienne Choiseul. Since marrying French banker Crozat’s granddaughter in 1750, Choiseul, the son of a chamberlain of Empress Maria-Theresa’s husband, became Ambassador to Rome by 1753. As Court Banker, Jean-Paris Montmartel retired, France contracted Jean-Joseph Laborde to supply and finance the military. A Bayonne General Receiver and son of the Marine Treasurer, Laborde was born in Jaca, Spain, to a daughter of the noble d’Aleman family of Béarn. The Labordes had extensive connections, particularly in Canada and Spain. In the French colonial fortress of Louisbourg, on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Laborde’s sisters married the Keeper of the Royal Warehouses in 1750 and a schooner owner. Laborde also lent money to various agencies, including Beaujon Goossens, to support military and governmental operations during the period. Since the 1740s, the Huguenot Beaujon family linked France with her Canadian colony. In the 1680s, two Beaujon brothers owned vineyards in Bordeaux. After Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, one brother converted to Catholicism to avoid land confiscation, while the other moved to Holland. Born in 1708, Jean, the Catholic brother’s grandson, married a daughter of Louis XV’s chamberlain. Having expanded into the grain trade and the family’s wealth, Jean Beaujon left his estate to his son Nicolas after his death in

In the 1680s, two Beaujon brothers owned vineyards in Bordeaux. After Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, one brother converted to Catholicism to avoid land confiscation, while the other moved to Holland. Born in 1708, Jean, the Catholic brother’s grandson, married a daughter of Louis XV’s chamberlain. Having expanded into the grain trade and the family’s wealth, Jean Beaujon left his estate to his son Nicolas after his death in 1745. Moving to Paris by 1751, Nicolas invested heavily in shipping. In 1756, Nicolas became the La Rochelle Receiver General of Finance, managing naval finances. He partnered with the Dutch Pierre-François Goossens, a Dutchman naturalized as French in Bilbao, to supply the French navy. In 1758, they formed Beaujon Goossens, securing Dutch loans for naval frigates and managing Dutch investments in French debt and tax farms during the Seven Years’ War. Along with naval operations, Beaujon Goossens financed Gradis’ services. Sephardi Gradis of Bordeaux advanced large sums to the royal administration and supplied French forces in Canada, securing state contracts for military garrisons. The firm also sent 17 shiploads of supplies to the colonies during a famine. While Choiseul became ambassador to the Habsburg court in Vienna from 1757, Laborde soon became Collector General and purchased paper rescriptions for money advanced in the royal service. However, the Panic of 1759 struck late in the year, particularly affecting Laborde. Beaujon Goossens encountered issues when their funds from Holland and London fell short. In October 1759, payments on bills of exchange from French colonies like Quebec were suspended, worsening the financial situation. Beaujon Goossens declared bankruptcy in November, causing disruptions across European banking networks, including Pels in Amsterdam and Hope in London. While Gradis managed to survive through the war despite ship losses and the delay in payments until 1762, Pinto in Amsterdam went bankrupt during the financial strain in 1761. As Avignon expelled Jews in 1762, Isaäc Pinto petitioned Duke Louis Richelieu to secure privileges for Sephardi. Laborde soon replaced Choiseul as Court Banker, and so managed payments to diplomats and subsidies to allies. To cement the alliance between King Louis XV and Empress Maria-Theresa for France to subsidize Austria, Court Banker Laborde and the Montmartel, Nettine, and Choiseul families kinterlinkwed. Although her daughter Marie-Antoinette was still in the cradle, the Empress promised her in marriage to the French Crown Prince. In April 1760, Laborde married Barbe Nettine’s daughter. In early 1762, another daughter wed Joseph Harvelay, Keeper of the Royal Treasury and Jean-Paris Montmartel’s great-nephew and successor. By July, a third daughter married Ange-Laurent Jully, Introducer of Ambassadors and Poisson’s protégé. Also in 1762, the Empress chartered Austria’s first public note issuing bank in Vienna based on Venice’s Giro Bank. After the death of Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson in 1764, Choisul was forced to retire by his enemies. As Austria and France

Also in 1762, the Empress chartered Austria’s first public note issuing bank in Vienna based on Venice’s Giro Bank. After the death of Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson in 1764, Choisul was forced to retire by his enemies. As Austria and France solidified their military alliance from 1757, Russia joined shortly after. Despite several tactical victories, Frederick faced mounting pressure. By February 1759, Ephraim allied with Itzig-Jaffe to lease the Prussian mints as well as those in Leipzig and Dresden. From August, Prussia suffered more defeats, with King Frederick having to flee Berlin and, the following month, Austrian forces occupied Dresden. Since Daniel Itzig-Jaffe’s niece Sprinz married Salomon Levy of Posen, Sprinz’s sister married a son of one of the Goldschmidt-descended Frankels who had left mining in 1761. That year, Levy received a Berlin settlement permit from Frederick to mint coins. After Ephraim and Itzig-Jaffe concluded contracts in 1762, Itzig-Jaffe’s nephew married a Fürst, connecting to the Saxon Court Jews. The same year, the Austrian Habsburgs finally settled debts to the Oppenheim family, and Moses Mendelssohn married Samuel Oppenheim’s great-granddaughter, Fromet Guggenheim, and became a Protected Jew of Berlin. As Fromet’s sisters wed Leon Hirschel and Moses Fürst, Moses’ network in-law network expanded, and gained acclaim on his philosophy of morality. Since resources and credit grew scarce during the war, the mints decreased quality and local hoarding of high-quality coins led to inflation. Growing coin exchange and credit stimulated bankers. Johann Gotzkowsky, an orphaned son of a minor noble from the Polish Danzig area, apprenticed at a Berlin merchant house before establishing a silk and porcelain business and becoming a merchant to Frederick. While Frederick bailed out Gotzkowsky several times, Gotzkowsky later intervened when Russian forces occupied Berlin and took Itzig-Jaffe hostage, successfully reducing the ransom. But while Prussian law required him to accept devalued currency, Dutch creditors demanded payment in sound coin. Still, Itzig-Jaffe and Ephraim confiscated Gotzkowsky’s coinage imported in violation of exchange regulations. From 1761, Gotzkowsky worked with co-religionist Splitgerber Daum. After Daum died in 1743, David Splitgerber took control and brought in Johan Schickler of Alsace, who married his daughter and became a partner. Along with owning ships, the firm traded goods such as tropical products, grain, timber, pig-iron, linen, and copper, and dealt in bills of exchange, coins, and British annuities. King Frederick consulted Splitgerber on commercial matters, and the firm supplied arms and munitions from the War of the Austrian Succession. In the American theater of the war, David Franks’ sister-in-law married the fellow-widowed nephew of David Barclay, head of Barclay London, and extended credit to Willing of Philadelphia. As the war reached a stalemate, French

control and brought in Johan Schickler of Alsace, who married his daughter and became a partner. Along with owning ships, the firm traded goods such as tropical products, grain, timber, pig-iron, linen, and copper, and dealt in bills of exchange, coins, and British annuities. King Frederick consulted Splitgerber on commercial matters, and the firm supplied arms and munitions from the War of the Austrian Succession. In the American theater of the war, David Franks’ sister-in-law married the fellow-widowed nephew of David Barclay, head of Barclay London, and extended credit to Willing of Philadelphia. As the war reached a stalemate, French attempt to involve Spain resulting in heavy losses. However, the death of Tsarina Elizabeth in 1762 saved Frederick, leading to a shift in alliances under her nephew Peter. Peace negotiations began with Europe’s terms restoring the pre-war status quo. However, Itzig-Jaffe out of Prussia was perhaps the wealthiest man in Europe. But like other Court Jews, he had limited free agency. Under pressure from Frederick to invest his profits into Prussian manufacturing, he purchased iron works in the Harz Mountains. But the general post-war deflation also set off a crisis among international traders of bills of exchange. After the small Jewish trader Arend Joseph allegedly absconded Amsterdam in January 1763 to the sanctuary city of Culemborg, unsubstantiated antisemitic rumors blamed him for starting a panic, although sanctuary cities accepted only debtors, not thieves, homosexuals, or others judged to be criminal. When illiquidity drove the larger Christian Neufville of Amsterdam into insolvency, Hope and other creditors supported a composition, but a holdout by Pels forced bankruptcy on July 25. On August 4, a group of Jewish merchants of Hamburg and Amsterdam petitioned Amsterdam for bankruptcy preference. Two days later, the bank money premium collapsed as 17 Amsterdam houses ceased payments. The Panic of 1763 erupted after a group of Hamburg creditors threatened to shut down trading on Amsterdam unless they were granted preferences. Although Neufville eventually paid out over 60% in 36 years, the Hamburg banks could not stand a protracted bankruptcy process. Where endorsement formerly offered security, now Hamburg banks were asked to pay twice for the same bill—once to failed Amsterdam bankers, and once to the bill owner—distressing selling to meet obligations from the accommodation bills. In Prussia, Gotzkowsky and other Berlin firms warned King Frederick that local manufacturers might fail if the panic spread to Prussia and asked for a moratorium. While Frederick refused a general moratorium, he requested Itzig-Jaffe grant credit to Gotzkowsky on August 10th. Arguing that Gotzkowsky was insolvent, Itzig-Jaffe refused. Nor did Splitgerber Daum aid him. As Frederick’s loan proposal failed, the situation worsened. On August 13th, the Berlin City Council reported Gotzkowsky's inability to redeem bills of exchange and suggested an emergency fund. Despite the request, King Frederick established a targeted moratorium for Gotzkowsky and a special bankruptcy court. By 1764, Frederick shuttered the mints and began a deflationary program to improve coin quality. Austro-French bankers, meanwhile, consolidated. While in Paris in 1764,

for a moratorium. While Frederick refused a general moratorium, he requested Itzig-Jaffe grant credit to Gotzkowsky on August 10th. Arguing that Gotzkowsky was insolvent, Itzig-Jaffe refused.

Despite the request, King Frederick established a targeted moratorium for Gotzkowsky and a special bankruptcy court. By 1764, Frederick shuttered the mints and began a deflationary program to improve coin quality. Austro-French bankers, meanwhile, consolidated. While in Paris in 1764, Johann Fries married Anne Escherny, the daughter of a notable Neuchátel burgess who also served as consul in Lyons for the King of Poland. Fries’ influence grew notably after 1763 when he began overseeing most of Poland’s external loans. By 1766, Fries brought fellow Huguenot Johann Gontard of Frankfurt’s Gontard into Fries. So did the Court Jews. During the Seven Years’ War, Israel Popper Hönig supplied the Austrian army, leading Maria-Theresa to grant him privileges to settle in Bohemian Jewish communities, engage in trade, and secure the tobacco monopoly leases for various regions. Since the Empress expelled Jews and formed the Habsburg Empire’s first joint-stock private bank Moravian Loan Bank in 1751, shareholders dismissed the first director for neglecting lending in 1765, and transferred control of the bank to the Jewish tobacco monopoly, likely under government pressure. That year, the Empress allowed Hönig to create the first decade-long Jewish tobacco tax farming syndicate including Hönig’s uncle Joachim Popper (the son of the Primator of Bohemian rural Jews), a Gunzburg cousin Primator of Prague, and the Königswarters of Bohemia, who kinterlinked with two Oppenheim Hirschels and the son of the Primator of Prague, who descended from Koppel Frankel. In 1767, Hönig’s sister married a descendant of Koppel Frankel two years later. For supplying the Mint of the Elector of Saxony during through the Seven Years’ War, Simon Bondi became Saxon Court Jew in 1765, and his nephew married Joachim Popper’s niece, the daughter of Löbl Duschenes, a decade later. Bohemia also forged ties with Austria’s Port Jews. Since incorporating Trieste’s Jewish tax in the 1740s, Menasse Morpurgo, Grassin Levi and his cousin Gioachimo Vivante Hierschel, Isacco Alpron, and the Luzzattos incorporated Trieste’s first insurer in 1764. From 1775, the Hierschels boosted exports of Bohemian textile through Trieste, where Marco Levi established a monopoly on tobacco sales, and Morpurgo grew the insurer. Chartering Prussia’s Royal Bank to monetize plantations for his knights, the Junkers, in June 1765, Frederick monopolized credit by requiring all payments be made via Royal Bank and channeled all trusts and public funds therein. By August, the run from coins and domestic credit forced to institute a general three-year moratorium. As Royal Bank bailed out insiders, she suspended payouts by October. Like Gotzkowsky had to liquidate his silk factories that year, many bankers who had averted bankruptcy in 1763, collapsed by 1766. Private credit further disappeared after Frederick threatened

the daughter of an Oder communal elder. Her brother moved to Grodno around the same time and traded with the family. Possibly related to the Glogau family, Judith closely cooperated in business with Zbytkower, unlike his former wives. Around the same time, King Stanislaw established a fair in Radziwill’s Berdichev. Before railroads, Berdichev was Eastern Europe’s largest trade hub, with Jews trading iron, textiles, leather, flock, and wood goods. And so Berdichev became a key location for Russian army purveyors. While Central Europe increasingly allowed the inheritance of rabbinical posts, Western Europe largely upheld the prohibition. Indeed, Rabbi of Prague Ezekiel Landau supported the appointment of a rabbi’s son to succeed his father, despite community opposition. While the disbanding of the Council of the Four Lands in 1764 diminished central authority over communal decisions, Polish nobles increasingly influenced rabbinical appointments. For example, since they were forbidden to settle in Bialystok, Jewish merchants developed Orla into a center of trade with cities like Königsberg, Wroclaw, and Bialystok. However, Orla’s Jewish community divided into factions led by Binyomin Kielmanowicz and Lejzer Hirszowicz. While Kielmanowicz secured a ten-year ban on Hirszowicz from the kahal in 1775, Hirszowicz secured the rabbinate for his son. The disputes reached Orla’s owner Izabela Branicka—sister of King Poniatowski and an in-law and extended cousin of the Radziwills—who resolved the conflict with a law defining the roles of rabbis and kahal leaders. Unlike Constantinople other court factors, the Bazargan Basi provided the Janissaries with animals, weapons, food, and other goods on credit. Many of these posts were dangerous. While Bazargan David Zonana established strong connections with Janissary Commander Pasha Seyyid Hasan, he was executed after a rival faction replaced Seyyid in 1746. Within months, however, the new Pasha hired David’s son, Jacob, to continue his legacy. The Zonana held the position until 1768, when their likely in-laws, Aciman, relieved them. Around Syrian Palestine, roaming Bedouins prevented farming and travel for centuries. In the 1720s, Bedouin Zaydans established control. As Dahir Omar became head of the family and leased tax and development rights. As he appointed his sons as rulers of sub-provinces, he waged multiple wars against Ottoman authorities and the ruler of Damascus, Suleyman Azm. When he sought to increase the population and approached the Jews, lowering taxes and supporting the resettlement of Tiberias. Haim Farhi and other Sephardi moved to Damascus to vend via their Gubbay in-laws in Constantinople. Still, Jews would later remember Dahir and his sons as cruel tyrants. (Of Davidic descent, the Gubbay family—which translates to treasurer—served for generations as Baghdad’s Nasi.) In 1737, Suleyman Azm tried to capture Tiberias from Dahir Omar but failed and was deposed. Reappointed in 1741, he renewed his efforts. In 1742, Suleyman’s Jewish bankers, Farhi and Joseph Lutzati, warned Chief Rabbi of Tiberias Haim Abulafia of another siege, but Abulafia decided to stay. The siege ended when Suleyman was ordered to manage the Mecca pilgrim caravans. In 1743, Suleyman besieged Tiberias again. Abulafia wrote to Constantinople officials in support

protect Orthodox worshippers, Catherine received a large indemnity, which she used to partially repay her loans. While Austria received Turkish Bukovina, which she later fused into Galicia, Russia turned to trade, colonizing Donetsk by promoting German, Bulgarian, and Greek immigration. While Noble Bank financed Russian colonialism, Russia also turned to her new Jewry. At the time, Jews in Polish Belarus experienced lenient conditions. While constituting approximately 10% of the population in Podole, Volhynia, and Minsk, most resided in villages and small towns. With a prominent presence in leasing alcoholic beverage businesses from local gentry, Jews accounted for 54% of the merchant estate. After centuries of relying on the protection of the Polish crown, they encountered challenges from the declining influence of the crown and local nobility, clergy, and bourgeoisie. Nonetheless, they maintained self-government through legal pluralism via the kahal, which oversaw administrative, judiciary, and fiscal matters. Interested mainly in profits, Catherine II granted limited autonomy to Belarussian Jews. This included the right to collect and manage their own tax collection, but they remained subject to Polish legal jurisdiction, continuing to lack citizenship, and restricted from travel or urban business. Two Belarussian provinces did receive discrete rights for operating in cities. Meanwhile, Prussia granted Salomon Levy and his family general protection privileges to conduct business in 1774, Itzig-Jaffe joined with cousin Levy to import silver coinage with Vienna via Silesia along the Oder River. Within a year, Levy’s daughter married a Berlin banker Joel Halle, a second great-nephew of Glikl Pinkerle Goldschmidt’s sister, linking to the Hamburg trade. And as Salomon passed away, his widow Sprinz took over. Before 1750, non-Spanish European expansion sought to expand capitalist agriculture. The wars between Britain and France from 1741 to 1763 in North America prompted a shift in British colonialism, necessitating coordination between forces and colonies. Despite the colonies rejecting federal authority in 1754, British management during the war and post-victory unity were acknowledged. After 1750, changes in the British colonial system saw the retention of forts on the Gold Coast, while RAC faced challenges, leading to financial difficulties. The company gave up its charter in 1750, and bases were administered by Co of Merchants Trading to Africa. Despite minimal coast administration, financial troubles persisted. While Freame and other goldsmith bankers continued growing, the greater trade during the Seven Years’ War across the British empire spurred merchant-bankers to generate trade credit by employing Dutch-style chains of bills across London, Paris, and Amsterdam. Contemporaries—including Adam Smith, a distant Smyth cousin—suspected that this process was fraudulent and supported fictious, rather than real bills. Since marrying and joining Quaker goldsmith Freame as partners, a Barclay married co-religionist Bevan in the 1730s, who joined the bank. As Welsh Bevan was involved in copper refining, Freame banked the Quaker Welsh Mines Royal Copper and London Lead Co. Notably, between 50 to 75% of ironworks in England and Wales during the first half of the 18th century were either owned or managed by Quakers. From 1760s, the Quaker banking partnerships

chains of bills across London, Paris, and Amsterdam. Contemporaries—including Adam Smith, a distant Smyth cousin—suspected that this process was fraudulent and supported fictious, rather than real bills. Since marrying and joining Quaker goldsmith Freame as partners, a Barclay married co-religionist Bevan in the 1730s, who joined the bank. As Welsh Bevan was involved in copper refining, Freame banked the Quaker Welsh Mines Royal Copper and London Lead Co. Notably, between 50 to 75% of ironworks in England and Wales during the first half of the 18th century were either owned or managed by Quakers. From 1760s, the Quaker banking partnerships multiplied. While Barclay kinterlinked with the Gurneys of Norwich and Samuel Gurney joined the bank, the descendants of Bank of Nottingham’s Smyth family branched to other cities. After forming the first bank around Birmingham, Smyth partnered with Bevan and encouraged iron forging Barclay in-law Lloyd to start a bank after James Barclay died. Eventually, other Barclays bought Smyth out, reinstating the Quaker heritage. Since Abel Smyth married Jane Beaumont in 1745, Quaker linen-draper John Arthington co-founded a textile bank in Leeds with woolen merchant Thomas Lodge, a descendant of the Beaumonts, in the ‘50s. After Lodge’s in-laws kinterlinked with the Anglican Beckett family of merchants related to the Duncombes, the latter gained control of the bank, which they renamed Beckett. Other goldsmith bankers connected to Scotts. Since apprenticing at Lombard Street’s Grasshopper—a family of goldsmith bankers tracing bank to Thomas Gresham before developing into a bank, Martin—in 1713, Joseph Vere formed his own bank and became Prime Warden of Goldsmith Co in 1753. He partnered with Thomas Hallifax, chief clerk at Martin, and Richard Glyn, a dye trader and City Sheriff, to found Vere Glyn Hallifax in 1754. The same year, Glyn married a daughter of silk mercer Robert Carr, whose niece wed a Drummond. After Vere’s death in 1766, Glyn Hallifax became involved in the Scottish Carron ironworks. Since Scottish Trading failed to amalgamate with Bank of Scotland, Archibald Campbell, brother of the Second Duke of Argyll, gained a Charter for Royal Bank of Scotland, the second of Scotland’s joint stock banks, in 1727. His second cousin, John Campbell, shared the name of his grandfather, the first Earl of Breadalbane. As a goldsmith, the younger John Campbell joined Royal Bank of Scotland part-time, became Secretary in 1737, Second Cashier in 1739, and First Cashier in 1745 until his death in 1777. Unlike the private banks, the chartered banks Bank of Scotland and Royal Bank of Scotland used the clause that gave them the option to suspend convertibility of notes into specie—which saved the banks during the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland and the Panic of 1745. Following the uprising, normalcy resumed, and British Linen Co received a charter in 1746 to develop Scottish industry, soon issuing circulating notes to do so. Before the Earl of Breadalbane’s first cousin once removed married the daughter of Colonel David Barclay in 1756, his niece wed James Coutts in 1755, forming Campbell Coutts London.

and Dutch Saint-Eustatius. Between 1753 and 1759, he traded tobacco in Virginia and North Carolina under his uncles’ supervision. Campbell was a partner in an Antiguan trading firm from 1759 and conducted business with British-occupied Martinique. In a related set of strategic marriages, four of West Indies trader John Campbell’s sons married into other West Indies families. Scotland-born Richard Oswald ventured into trade across North America and the Caribbean during the 1730s. By 1741, he became a partner in his cousins’ firm, and later, with substantial profits from the War of the Austrian Succession, he relocated to London in 1746 to trade tobacco, horses, slaves, and sugar. Co-founding Oswald in London in 1748, he bought the slave trading outpost Bance Island off Sierra Leone. Two years later, Oswald married the daughter of a wealthy Jamaica merchant, while his cousin married a Campbell of unknown lineage. He partnered with family and other correspondents from North Carolina to Grenada, Calcutta, and Europe, including Hope in Amsterdam, Lamb in Paris, and Robert Herries. Herries was born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, to Lord William Herries of Halldykes. Robert’s father faced financial difficulties, and his uncle saved the family’s fortune by securing him an apprenticeship in Rotterdam in 1747. With the assistance of Hope, he moved to Barcelona, starting a wine trade business by 1754 and soon expanding to Montpellier, Valencia, and the Mediterranean. After he met John Coutts in Rotterdam, Herries became Managing Partner of Coutts as the older partners aged out, alongside William in 1762. Following a dispute over control with the Coutts family, Herries withdrew from his other ventures, settled in London, and renamed the London firm Herries in 1766, while Forbes oversaw business in Edinburgh. Likewise, Scots entered Georgia, and, by the mid-1760s, controlled commerce in Savannah, Augusta, and Sunbury’s rice trade. In Savannah the leading export houses included Graham, Gordon, and Baillie. Oswald’s correspondent John Graham was identified by the governor to the Board of Trade as personally known to London officials. Operating Gordon in Savannah and Charleston, John Gordon was related to the Drummond, Forbes, and Barclay families and connected to Lord Adam Gordon, who directed capital into East Florida. Robert Baillie’s father and uncle were Edinburgh businessmen. Samuel McCall’s family linked Virginia to Glasgow as his sons engaged in merchant banking and founded the aristocratic Thistle Bank in 1761. His granddaughter married Glasgow banker George Thomson in 1749, whose daughter married Edinburgh banker Alexander Bonar—son of a minister of Perth—in 1786, and together they established Thomson Bonar in London, focusing on the Russian trade. However, as American colonies issued commodity- and land-backed banknotes, Rhode Island’s Redwood and other merchants again complained about inflated banknotes in 1750. While Parliament began regulating and restricting notes in 1751, she allowed bank notes to continue depreciating and legalized payment in British specie over the Seven Years’ War. Following the war, Parliament delegalized the notes in 1763. As the Treaty of Paris ended the Seven Years’ War in 1763 returned Guadeloupe to France, it

Following the war, Parliament delegalized the notes in 1763. As the Treaty of Paris ended the Seven Years’ War in 1763 returned Guadeloupe to France, it transferred Indes territories to establish British rule in Canada and commercial domination of India by EIC. With the Treaty of Paris, Britain acquired Grenada, Tobago, Saint-Vincent, and Dominica from France, Britain’s first major Caribbean acquisition in a century. Over the next decade, Grenada planters converted French cocoa and coffee estates into sugar cane, building aqueducts, dams, and mills, which made Grenada Britain’s second largest sugar producer. Unlike in the established colonies, planters took on broader roles, including politics and trades, while relying on Scottish financing. A descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, Alexander Campbell did not descend from the Argylls. While his Gordon fifth great aunt married into the family, his descendants kinterlinked with Middleton Campbell. In the 1750s, he worked in Barbados, Saint-Christopher, and Saint-Eustatius in the Virginia and North Carolina tobacco trade to 1759, as a partner in a firm in Antigua to 1762, and in commerce with British-occupied Martinique after 1762. He later engaged in politics and managed estates in Grenada, Tobago, and Saint-Vincent. His nephew established Bartlet Campbell with offices in London, Grenada, Tobago, and the Grenadines. But as Britain passed temporary acts to assist insolvent debtors in 1755, 1761, and in 1765, merchant councils continued to disallow insolvency and bankruptcy statutes passed in colonial Americas. Since the war drastically increased demand for slaves, America switched from importing out of the West Indies to increase direct voyages to the west coast of Africa in search of slaves. After Rhode Island Quakers outlawed the import of slaves after decades of debate in 1761, slavery remained legal for another decade. While Oswald expanded into government contracting during the war, they partnered with Lamb to buy land after, accumulating extensive properties in the Caribbean and North America from 1762. While a cousin-in-law of the first Earl of Breadalbane started Finlay in 1745 and soon traded cotton with Asia and South America, another Campbell cousin-in-law married the son of Irish Catholic banker George Colebrooke. Colebrooke had married the daughter of an Irish planter in the West Indies and partnered with Irish and Scottish financiers, including Nesbitt in London, Cantillon in Paris, and Hope in Amsterdam. Banking increasingly invested not only in trade finance, but also fixed capital for industry. In Scotland, increased labor competition led collieries to enserf coalers using annual non-competition contracts in 1765. Strikes increased London coal prices by a third, but the system remained.

1745 and soon traded cotton with Asia and South America, another Campbell cousin-in-law married the son of Irish Catholic banker George Colebrooke. Colebrooke had married the daughter of an Irish planter in the West Indies and partnered with Irish and Scottish financiers, including Nesbitt in London, Cantillon in Paris, and Hope in Amsterdam. Banking increasingly invested not only in trade finance, but also fixed capital for industry. In Scotland, increased labor competition led collieries to enserf coalers using annual non-competition contracts in 1765. Strikes increased London coal prices by a third, but the system remained. Unlike merchant capitalized banks, Scot landowners founded Ayr started in 1769 to fund coal canals for James Watt’s forge. And while British Linen Co helped Scotland’s linen industry blossom, British Linen Co’s lack of linen sales success led her to pivot solely to banking and investing in coal. British presence in India had grown since 1707 as a series of short-lived Mughal rulers out of Delhi oversaw the loss of outlying provinces to the Marathas, Jats, Sikhs, and Rohilla Afghans. Invasions by Nadir Shah in 1738 and Ahmad Shah Abdali in the subsequent years severely weakened the Empire. While Jain seth and Hindu bankers collected taxes to fund Muslim Mughals and Christian EIC, the Hindi Marathas and other competitors gradually eroded seths’ traditional business and clientele over decades. As the Marathas launched raids into the Malwa plateau from the mid, Mughal towns decayed as they supported new capitals like Indore and Gwalior. Likewise, invasions by rulers like Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Durrani caused financial panic and agrarian disruption. Along with these changes, the Jagat Seth was at the mercy of Bengal’s ruler. In 1733, Jagat Seth Fatehchand supported Alivardi Khan’s ascent to power as Nawab of Bengal. At Fatehchand’s death in 1744, the Jagat Seth title passed to his grandson, Mahatabchand, who secured financing during Khan’s negotiations with the Marathas in 1751. However, as the Seven Years’ War started the same year that Alivardi died in 1756, a rift developed between Jagat Seth and the new Nawab, Alivardi’s grandson, Sirajuddaulah. So, Jagat Seth funded EIC and overthrew Sirajuddaulah in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Following Sirajuddaulah’s defeat, the British installed Jafar as the Nawab. Jagat Seth regained influence in 1760 under Jafar, but it was short-lived as Qasim rose to power in 1763 with the end of the Seven Years’ War, leading to Jagat Seth’s downfall. Despite Jafar’s subsequent return to the governorship, Bengal fell under British control after the Battle of Buxar in 1764, replacing local authority with British dominance and Jagat Seths with EIC. While French Bengal taxed rural credit during the Seven Years’ War, EIC codified the tax to force EIC credit after defeating the French. Without rural credit, famine struck Bengal by 1770. While the previously dominant Gujaratis of Surat in the west declined, and Agarwal and Khattri traders became important financiers. In particular, the Hindu merchants of Benares in the north intermediated between local rulers and the trade

Jagat Seth’s downfall. Despite Jafar’s subsequent return to the governorship, Bengal fell under British control after the Battle of Buxar in 1764, replacing local authority with British dominance and Jagat Seths with EIC. While French Bengal taxed rural credit during the Seven Years’ War, EIC codified the tax to force EIC credit after defeating the French. Without rural credit, famine struck Bengal by 1770. While the previously dominant Gujaratis of Surat in the west declined, and Agarwal and Khattri traders became important financiers. In particular, the Hindu merchants of Benares in the north intermediated between local rulers and the trade networks. The Das family, for example, helped Benares settle a forced loan to the Nawab of Oudh. With EIC’s territorial consolidation in Bengal from 1764 after the Buxar victory, the Benares bankers collected and transferred revenues, supporting EIC’s expanding influence. In 1769, Gopal Das became a key financier for EIC after the British acquired the revenue rights to Benares from the Nawab of Oudh. Moving funds from Benares to Lucknow and Calcutta, the Das facilitated the collection and remittance of state revenues from Benares and other regions to EIC’s treasury in Calcutta. With war having depleted resources in Britain, the Navy created a timber reserve and restricted cartels and EIC. Growing insolvent, EIC borrowed from BOE to pay dividends. However, as Scot Alex Fordyce shorted EIC’s stock with credit from Dutch Jews, EIC’s sustained share price and BOE’s refusal to fund Fordyce (possibly because of his engagement with Jews), led Fordyce to fraud. After Fordyce absconded and precipitated the Panic of 1772, Ayr and many other Scottish and Dutch houses collapsed, including Pels in Amsterdam and Arbuthnot Guthrie in Edinburgh. While gold from London quelled the crisis, the Arbuthnot family relied on Coutts. Among Ayr’s correspondents, Glyn Hallifax of London stopped payment. With the death of Richard Glyn, his doctor issued a statement to dispel rumors of suicide. To avoid bankruptcy, Indies linen trader William Mills advanced funds to Glyn Hallifax on the condition that he and his nephew Charles joined the partnership, which soon became Glyn Mills (“Glyn”). Charles’ brother William Mills soon became a director of EIC. Amidst the crisis, BOE made a loan to a third party to enable them to meet their indebtedness to Glyn and allow for the payment bills which were discounted and held by BOE. Likewise, temporary insolvency laws helped British debtors, but British merchants disallowed American debt stays. Moreover, unsold EIC tea accumulated due to high taxes. While EIC cut dividends as BOE withdrew support, Parliament lowered EIC taxes for her to compete with smuggled Dutch tea. As EIC monopolized tea, Bostonian protest led to punitive law, and soon the American Revolution. With the Scottish and American markets disrupted, Tobacco Lord Robert Herries planned a new monetary service. Rebuffed by the Coutts family, Herries established London Exchange Banking Co by 1772 with William Forbes and Hope. The bank introduced “circular notes”, a precursor to travelers’ cheques, from Lisbon to Moscow. After Herries

century. While Ephraim and Frankels wed in 1777, several of Itzig-Jaffe’s children married those of his wife’s Wulff and Moses Mendelssohn’s Katz branches. As Itzig-Jaffe became a Parnas of Berlin, he funded his son and Mendelssohn in silk businesses. Although Ephraim Berlin closed in 1776, the Ephraims joined Itzig-Jaffe and Mendelssohn in funding the first modern Jewish school in Europe in 1778. Likewise, Itzig-Jaffe funded Mendelssohn’s translation of the Talmud into German with assistance from Ephraim’s Hartwig Wessely. Despite endorsements from Berlin rabbis and Britain’s Hirschel Levin, Orthodox Katz-descendants like rabbis Ezekiel Landau and Raphael Kohen opposed publication in 1780. Since the 1740s, Kohen held rabbinates in Polish Rakov, Vilkomir, Minsk, and Pinsk before becoming Chief Rabbi of the united communities of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbeck in 1777. While Kohen considered excommunication, the King of Denmark’s subscription prevented such action. While Mendelssohn’s Haskalah aimed for modernization and integration through education and reason, Hasidism, led by charismatic mystics like the Baal Shem Tov, focused on spiritual leadership and emotional devotion. Katz descendant Elijah Solomon—the Wilna Gaon, or the Supreme Authority on Jewish law—condemned Hasidism as heretical and excommunicated its followers in Wilna in 1772. This opposition extended from Brody in Austrian Galicia to Mogilev in Russian Belarus. Instead, the Wilna Gaon . Similarly, Rabbi of Prague Ezekiel Landau’s children married into rabbinical families. His son Samuel married the daughter of Rabbi of Lissa, and led the Rabbinical Board in Prague. Landau’s first daughter married Joseph Hatzaddik, a fellow Katz-descendant, who served as rabbi of Vitkow, Sokol, Jaworow, and, ultimately, Posen. Another daughter married a son of Meir Pressburger of Vienna and his wife, a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim and the Mandl Prefects of Hungarian Jews. Since Rabbi Landau sided against the Frankfurt Rabbis in a divorce case, he and his sons were banned from the Frankfurt Rabbinate in 1769. But since Landau had called on Jews to support Austria during the Seven Years’ War, Maria-Theresa created the post of Chief Rabbi of Galicia in 1776 to help organize Polish Jews of Brody, Lemberg, and the rest of Galicia. As Landau declined the lifetime appointment, the position went to merchant Aryeh Bernstein, son of a Frankfurt Parnas and grandson of a Katz Wulff. By 1779, Austria granted free trade zone status to Brody. But as Mendelssohn preached emancipation from the ghettos, parnasim feared assimilation would lead to loss of their special status, Christian Alsatians argued for rights to Jews as individuals, but not a class. While Landau opposed Hasidism, he refused to endorse Mendelssohn’s translation after Berliners began to question rabbinical authority. Landau was also concerned about its use for learning German. Although Mendelssohn intended to remove mistranslations, the German version accelerated the replacement of Hebrew in Germany and the Haskalah.

for rights to Jews as individuals, but not a class. While Landau opposed Hasidism, he refused to endorse Mendelssohn’s translation after Berliners began to question rabbinical authority. Landau was also concerned about its use for learning German. Although Mendelssohn intended to remove mistranslations, the German version accelerated the replacement of Hebrew in Germany and the Haskalah. A year after Empress Maria-Theresa’s death, her son and heir Joseph II revoked old Jewish self-rule in 1781, but retained his grandfather’s restrictions on Jewish marriages. As Vienna relaxed restrictions on Jewish bankers—but requiring identifying dress—Primator of Bohemian rural Jews Joachim Popper soon expanded his bank into Vienna. Within a year, Isaac Arnstein’s grandson Nathan Arnstein, Bernhard Eskeles, and David Wertheim protested collective financial responsibilities. After the act, Popper,, Landau, and the new Primator of Prague Jews Lobl Duschenes—who was Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe’s third-great-grandson, Popper’s brother-in-law, Simon Bondi’s nephew-in-law—agreed to bring the Haskalah to Austrian Jewry, Popper, as the first Prague Jew to reside outside the ghetto, collaborated with Landau and Duschenes to establish Prague’s first modern Jewish German-language school. By 1782, the Emperor issued the Edict of Toleration for Lower Austria’s Jews, promoting religious tolerance and secular education, allowing Jews to earn doctorates in law and medicine. As Jews feared that such education would distract Jewish youth from the Talmud, Wessely published a pamphlet urged Austrian Jews to establish schools. While Court Jews Isaac Orchel of France, Elia Morpurgo of Trieste, and Mendelssohn of Berlin commissioned the transition of Wessely’s works into French, Italian, and German, rabbis including Ezekiel Landau, Joseph Hatzaddik, Wilna Gaon Elijah, and Britain’s David Schiff and Hirschel Levin opposed this work. Opposing both Hasidism and the widespread use of twisted logic to resolve Talmudic contradictions, the Wilna Gaon championed common sense and rigorous textual analysis in religious study—unlike Mendelssohn’s secular approach. Both the Gaon and Mendelssohn had the support of Russian Prince Potemkin’s Court Advisor Joshua Zeitlin. A descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe like Zeitlin and a Katz and Luria cousin, Schneur Zalman of Liady, founded Chabad, emphasizing intellect over emotion in spiritual practice. By 1784, Zalman faced condemnation from opponents in Mogilev. Although Zalman attempted reconciliation, the Gaon refused to meet with him, worsening the divide. Despite these challenges, Hasidism continued to expand into Wilna, Ukraine, and Hungary, gaining control of the Wilna kahal by the early 1800s. While Huguenot Court banker Johann Fries lent to the 1780s, his wealth continued grew until his death 1785. As he faced public resentment, possibly due to his foreign Protestant background, and there were rumors of suicide in response to this backlash. Still, his children continued marrying into royalty, including his son who later took over Fries. Within a year, Lobl Duschenes’ son married Isaac Arnstein’s daughter, and, through her mother, a granddaughter of Merle Schiff Wertheim and Isaac Liebman, and so a cousin of the Pressburgers who kinterlinked with the British Goldsmid family in 1784, ensuring the gold flow between the two empires. Ennobled

and was one Alsace’s wealthiest Jews. While Baruch’s daughter married Wolf Guggenheim in 1710, his son was Sanvil, whose family soon kinterlinked Levy-Wimpfen’s son-in-law and other rabbis across the region. Still, the Jews faced competition in banking and industry from Protestants. The Huguenot Dietrich family had fled Lorraine for Strasbourg in the 16th century. In 1684, Jean Dietrich, a Lutheran banker, purchased the Jaegerthal forge, marking the family’s transition to ironmaking. Fellow Huguenot Wendel left Bruges after Spain sacked Antwerp in the late 16th century and settled in France. His descendant, Jean-Martin became the director of the Ottange forges in 1704. Using advances from Jewish bankers in Metz and Thionville, he acquired the Hayange forges the following year. In 1727, he secured noble status from the Duke of Lorraine and his son married the Lorraine Receiver General’s daughter and leased more state-owned forges. Earlier than in Alsace, Jewish bankers arose in Nancy and Metz in ducal Lorraine, where most were linked to the rural economy, including trading grains, livestock, and money lending. Lion Halphen Goudchaux of Metz began his trading activities in Lorraine around 1688 and settled there following the War of the Spanish Succession around 1714 as his brother-in-law wed Sanvil Weyl’s brother. (Halphen derives from a Hebrew word for money changer.) Supplying horses to the French army in Metz, he was allowed to relocate to Malzéville in 1717, the year of Levy-Wimpfen’s bankruptcy, as his second cousin once removed—who was also his daughter’s sister-in-law—married Wolf Guggenheim’s cousin, the banker Jacob Guggenheim. Likewise, Worms-born Jacob Worms had moved to Metz and married there. By 1690 he settled in Sarrelouis as a moneylender. His son Olry, born in Metz, married the daughter of a forge operator from Nikolsburg, who together received permission to return to Sarrelouis as military meat suppliers. Amidst suspected usury following the Panic of 1720, Duke Leopold exiled all the Jews who had migrated to Lorraine after 1680, allowing only 73 families, including four in Nancy. While Goudchaux’s children married a daughter of Katz-descendant Chief Rabbi of Treves Lwow-Eskeles in 1721, Aisik Orchel three years later, and the daughter of a wealthy Jew from Mutzig in 1725. Related to the priestly Traub of Mainz, the Orchels lived in Frankfurt and Hanau since before the Thirty Years War, kinterlinking with Schiff and Oppenheim. At that point, Goudchaux moved to Nancy, from where he sold German horses to Duke Leopold—providing all cavalry remounts in 1729—and engaged in secondhand clothes trading and money lending. Likewise, Itzig Netter’s son Leyman wed Court Jew of Mannheim Moses Oppenheim’s daughter in 1728. Following the death of Duke Leopold of Lorraine, his son Francis inherited the post and soon sought to marry his Habsburg cousin Maria-Theresa, Emperor Charles VI’s daughter. However, France feared Habsburg proximity. So, following the loss of War of the Polish Succession, the Duke traded Lorraine to French King Louis XV’s father-in-law Stanislaw Leszczyński in exchange for Tuscany after the death of the last Medici Duke in 1737. Following Lion Goudchaux’s

droit d’aubaine, allowing the King of France to inherit the possessions. Their naturalization process coupled with their conversion to Catholicism in 1785, marked their integration into French society, allowing them to establish social connections, inherit assets, and further their trade. Likewise, Protestant widows became bankers. After inheriting her husband’s Frankfurt bank in 1763, widow Rebekka Olenschlager hired bookkeepers rather than remarry. And the Crowns of Portugal to Germany routinely granted wives, daughters, and widows—of all religions—the same privileges and concessions as their deceased male family members. Upon the death of London banker Child’s Samuel Child in 1752, his widow, Agatha, and sons, Francis and Robert, carried on Child. As Agatha and Francis died in 1763, Robert became Head Partner and married Sarah Jodrell. Their daughter wed 10th Earl of Westmorland John Fane in 1782. At the same time, widows from Portugal, through Germany, to the Baltic and Scandinavian coasts represented up to 10% of shops, mines, and traders, and paying up to 20% of taxes in some cities. Even in smaller Rhineland cities, Protestant widows carried some of Germany’s longest lasting family businesses. While Aletta Haniel directed her husband’s shipping firm after he died in 1782 until her son reached majority, Helen Krupp invested in Rhenish mining companies and refused to relinquish managerial authority to her son. However, geopolitics inflated the prices of West Indies commodities and Black slaves. Sugar was the most valuable commodity imported to France and England from overseas, and the Caribbean became commercially more important to England than Asia. While America imported slaves from the West Indies since the 1730s, the Seven Years’ War increased demand, leading to an increase in direct voyages from local vessels to the west coast of Africa in search of slaves. Ending the Seven Years’ War in 1763, the Treaty of Paris returned Guadeloupe to France and established British rule in Canada and commercial domination of India by EIC. Along with wartime military debts, the loss of territories stifled Indes. Increased French coffee production in the Antilles soon deflated prices, fueling instability in Dutch Surinam and elsewhere in the West Indies by 1771, which the Panic of 1772 exacerbated, forcing many planters to leave, and fueling a new cycle. During the American Revolution, British forces promised land and funds to Black loyalists against the revolution colonies. After the war, the decline in British sugar imports caused distress among refiners, who petitioned Parliament for relief. This led to a push for increased sugar cultivation in the Caribbean, raising the prices of slaves. But the extension of farming into areas prone to hurricanes and droughts stimulated famines. Large partnerships dominated the British transatlantic slave trade. William Boast along with Peter Baker and his son-in-law John Dawson, the son of a poor farmer, dominated the trade out of Liverpool, handling almost two-thirds of the traffic from 1783 to 1792. After Dawson’s metric during the American Revolution, Baker Dawson held a contract with Spain from 1785 to 1788 and continued as leading supplier to the

Lutheran families established trading empires, including Baring, Kleinwort, and Schröder. By 1779, John Baring’s son Francis joined EIC’s board and in 1784 became the first of his family to serve in Parliament. As Francis’ son Alex, trained with Hope in Amsterdam, where his co-apprentice, Pierre Labouchere, the son of a Huguenot clothmaker, married Francis’ daughter. Following the death Joachim Kleinwort, his estate was equally divided per the prevailing law, which his youngest son, Hinrich, used to start importing British goods into Hamburg by 1786 and Amsterdam soon after. Like North German Lutherans, Swiss Huguenots held numerous high offices and engaged in commerce. In the 1730’s, Eschers installed northeast Switzerland’s first hydraulic motor-powered silk spinning mill. Eschers also joined other Swiss families to fund loans for Scandinavians to buy colonies in the West Indies by 1760. After his Huguenot father fled France in 1730 for London and married a Dutch expatriate, their London born son Isaac Panchaud engaged in the Indies trade before moving to Paris in 1763 to bank with cousin in Switzerland. By 1767, Laborde established Caisse d’Escompte with Louis XV’s support to intermediate advances to the King. But as Issac Thellusson’s partner, the Swiss Huguenot Jacques Necker, quarreled with Panchaud about fusing state debt with Indes, Necker convinced France to separate Indes’ commercial and royal functions by 1768, and France abolished Caisse d’Escompte. After reorganizing Indes, Necker utilized Swiss bankers to create a market for Indes debt. By 1772, Panchaud married a deceased Indes official’s daughter. Before dying in 1764, French Court Banker Jean-Paris Montmartel’s heiress and King Louis XV’s mistress Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson financed Pierre DuPont’s essay on landed capitalism. DuPont was born to Anne Monchanin, of a formerly wealthy French family impoverished by their commitment to the Huguenot faith, and Samuel DuPont, a Rouen watchmaker and one of eleven children from a modest home. With Poisson’s blessing, baron-turned-financier Jacques Turgot guided DuPont to the role of editor of the King’s Journal of Agriculture, Commerce, & Finance. By 1771, Turgot became the godfather of Pierre’s son Irénée. And as Louis XVI was crowned King in 1774 with his wife Marie-Antoinette, daughter of the Habsburg Empress Maria-Theresa, Turgot became Controller General of Finances and Pierre became Inspector General of Commerce. While Turgot organized a new Caisse d’Escompte with support from DuPont, he was dismissed in 1776. As Louis XVI sought a Treasury Controller but created a post for Necker due to concern about appointing a foreign Huguenot as Controller General. But while Panchaud formed a new Caisse d’Escompte with Mallet, Lessert, other Huguenots that year, Necker soon evicted him. By 1780, Catholic DuPont became an honorary knight in the Bureau of Finances. As some Huguenot Cazenoves returned to France from Switzerland, others moved to Amsterdam, and James Cazenove emigrated to London, where he wed a French pastor’s daughter. From 1781, Huguenot Dublin-born banker and MP David Touche negotiated to found a national bank. In 1783, Parliament granted Bank of Ireland’s charter, which excluded Catholics and Quakers from the board

[Thunderclap Part I.docx]
in 1782, Habsburg Emperor Joseph II issued the Edict of Toleration for Lower Austria’s Jews, promoting religious tolerance and secular education. Following his brother-in-law, Louis XVI of France abolished the body tax on Jews and animals, issuing letters patent extending new opportunities in commerce and industry to the Jews of Alsace. These letters aimed to restrict the growth of the Jewish population and limit usury. Strasbourg authorities declared Cerf Berr’s ownership of an estate invalid because he was Jewish and lacked the right to own property in the city. Berr argued that his 1775 letters patent of naturalization allowed him to own property anywhere in France, but the authorities contended that he purchased the hotel before receiving his naturalization papers. Although the status of Jews in France remained largely unchanged, wealthy Lorraine Jews obtained permits to buy property outside of their ghettos. Also in 1782, Frankfurt Stern banker Samuel Stern—a descendant of the Kanns and an extended Oppenheim and Wertheim cousin—married Sarah Kulp, a Katz-cousin and third cousin of Michael Speyer. Since widower Cerf Berr married a widow of Strasbourg banker Ratisbonne, herself a great-granddaughter of Samuel Oppenheim’s sister, in 1784, his niece married Goudchaux-in-law David Aron of Phalsbourg, and his daughter wed the son of Michael Speyer, who became Imperial Court Banker by 1786. A year after the son of Salomon and Sprinz Levy of Prussia married his first cousin once removed, Daniel Itzig-Jaffe’s daughter, in 1783, Prussia extended some Jewish freedoms in 1784, and the Prussian Levys received the rights of Christian Court factors. But French and Swiss interests faced another threat. Treaties between 1727 and 1731 had dissolved Austria’s East Indies trade out of Ostend under Anglo-Dutch pressure. As alliances shifted, former EIC employee Willem Bolts joined and Antwerp banker Charles Proli—who had inherited Proli bank from his widowed mother—to form Ostend Co and renew the trade in 1775. After establishing factories through 1778, wars between Mysore and the British disrupted operations. Losing Ostend, Proli liquidated by the early 1780s. After France, Britain, and America ended the war with the Treaty of Paris in 1783—for which free-trade promoting Pierre DuPont was ennobled—Britain received the Sultan of Kedah’s Penang Island, soon forcing the Dutch out of Malacca. Sensing a split between Britian and the Dutch during the war, Habsburg Court Banker Barbe Nettine’s grandson Edouard Walckiers started Banque Particulière in Ostend, Austrian Belgium, with former Coutts Managing Partner Robert Herries and his countryman Walter Boyd. Particulière invested in Nettine, which contracted a ship for the Angola slave trade. Establishing Belgium Assurance in 1782, Particulière expanded to Brussels, Ostend, Ghent, and Bruges by 1783. Walckiers became the Belgian Receiver General of Finance in 1784 and worked with Ezechiels of Rotterdam for two years. After briefly serving in Parliament, Herries expanded into colonial maritime insurance and privateering with Herries Keith out of Ostend. In 1784, Herries appointed his brother to lead Herries, with James Drummond joining as a partner. Within a year, Herries became London intermediary and maritime insurer for

Robert Herries and his countryman Walter Boyd. Particulière invested in Nettine, which contracted a ship for the Angola slave trade. Establishing Belgium Assurance in 1782, Particulière expanded to Brussels, Ostend, Ghent, and Bruges by 1783. Walckiers became the Belgian Receiver General of Finance in 1784 and worked with Ezechiels of Rotterdam for two years. After briefly serving in Parliament, Herries expanded into colonial maritime insurance and privateering with Herries Keith out of Ostend. In 1784, Herries appointed his brother to lead Herries, with James Drummond joining as a partner. Within a year, Herries became London intermediary and maritime insurer for Indes. For tobacco contracts, Herries collaborated with Boyd Ker as Boyd split to co-found a Parisian correspondent. Working with Hope and Baring, Boyd Ker failed to monopolize cochineal dye in 1787. Along with servicing American Minister Thomas Jefferson, Boyd Ker acted as Herries’ agent in bidding for a contract to supply Virginia tobacco to France. Along with holding Indes stock, Lamb Head Jean Lamb became a director of Caisse d’Escompte until selling Lamb to a Dutch refugee banker. Likewise, Swiss Huguenot bankers returned to Paris to fund Indes and other trade. Among the oldest was started by the Rougemonts, who received the hereditary viscountship of Besançon in 1030, where they produced three archbishops and were granted nobility in 1683. Since trader François Rougemont declined Prussian ennoblement, his son Jean-Jacques founded a Parisian banking house. As Rougemont partnered with Jean-Conrad Hottinguer to form Rougemont Hottinguer with several other patricians, they hired Henri Escher, whose father formed a bank by 1787. But although Louis XVI allowed Huguenots to live in France, follow any profession, and marry before civil justices, the French Treasury dwindled. As Swiss bankruptcies spread, Jean Escher shuttered his bank and joined the Russian military. At the same time, Russian Court Banker Friedrichs organized more loans from DeSmeth, driven partly by the political unrest in Holland and unsuccessful attempts to secure loans from Britain. By 1783, Catherine awarded Ukrainian Moshe Pernas—possibly a Sephardi shipbuilder—with the surname Rafalovich. His descendants dominated Russian grain. British merchant bankers, such as the evangelical Anglican Thornton, also lived in Russia and kinterlinked with descendants of Tsar Peter’s English shipbuilders, Wilberforce Baltic traders, and Smyth bankers. By 1784, the cousins established Baltic merchants Wilberforce Smyth. (As a Thornton wed a metal merchant’s daughter, a Smyth married merchant William Manning, the son of a Saint-Kitts planter who settled in London in the 1760s. William’s sister had married Huguenot slave trader Henry Laurens’ son, Oswald’s partner in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1776.) Grigory Potemkin was born in a village near Smolensk. His family owned a modest estate with 430 male serfs and claimed descent from Italian and Dalmatian princes. Catherine II noticed Potemkin for his wit in 1762 and made him her lover during her rise to power. After their affair ended, he remained her trusted advisor and de facto co-ruler. Potemkin founded the Black Sea Fleet and the cities of Sebastopol and Odessa, annexed Crimea, and led

settled in London in the 1760s. William’s sister had married Huguenot slave trader Henry Laurens’ son, Oswald’s partner in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1776.) Grigory Potemkin was born in a village near Smolensk. His family owned a modest estate with 430 male serfs and claimed descent from Italian and Dalmatian princes. Catherine II noticed Potemkin for his wit in 1762 and made him her lover during her rise to power. After their affair ended, he remained her trusted advisor and de facto co-ruler. Potemkin founded the Black Sea Fleet and the cities of Sebastopol and Odessa, annexed Crimea, and led Russia to victory in the Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774). In 1772, the First Partition of Poland incorporated approximately 45,000 Jews into the Russian Empire. In 1776, Tsarina Catherine awarded the Krichev district to Prince Potemkin and granted the Shklov district to another lover, General Semion Zorich. Both men managed these estates and interacted with local Jews. Inviting Jewish settlers to move to southern Russia, Potemkin permitted Jews to settle in areas left vacant by the Cossacks in 1777, provided they brought Gentile Poles and invested capital. Potemkin offered them seven years of tax exemption, permission to trade in wines and spirits, and protection from soldiers. From 1780, Russia opened fifteen note-issuing branch banks, mainly in newly annexed areas. More generally, Russia sought to economically integrate Jews, allowing them to engage banking and trade with the same taxes as Christians. As his brother became Zorich’s import-export agent in Riga, Shklov-born Joshua Zeitlin, a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, managed Potemkin’s, organized military supplies, and ran the mint at Kaffa in Crimea. Zeitlin, who frequently traveled with Potemkin, was made a Court Advisor, thereby allowing him to be a noble status and own the Mordvinov estates with 910 serfs. A promoter of Haskalah against Hasidism, Zeitlin maintained connections with the Wilna Gaon and Moses Mendelssohn, and his daughter married the Chief Rabbi of Berlin’s Katz-descendant nephew, Abram Peretz. Zorich’s contractor Mogilev-born merchant Natan Nota served Polish Lords before moving to Shklov and supplying Potemkin. Later serving Zorich, Nota wed the daughter of the Katz-descendant Rabbi of Metz. For international finance, Prince Potemkin depended upon Richard Sutherland, a third generation Russian-Scot shipbuilder affiliated with Russia Co, was instrumental in managing finances. Sutherland facilitated significant financial transactions, including arranging a loan in 1784 to support Potemkin’s colonization efforts of Mennonites from Danzig to New Russia. He also funded infrastructure, such as the construction of the town of Ekaterinoslav. Throughout their financial dealings, Sutherland faced challenges due to Potemkin’s erratic borrowing patterns and frequent defaults. By 1784, Russia Catherine annexed the Crimea of the Ottoman-allied Giray Khanate. With the death of Friedrichs, Tsarina Catherine appointed Sutherland the Court Banker. While Russia consolidated her note issuing banks and printed more notes, rumors about Sutherland spread in 1786, leading DeSmeth and other banks to decline his drafts. Although Russian initially negotiated with the Dutch and Danish for troop transport ships, British Thornton became the primary

petitioning Assembly for equal rights. Orchel, however, sought to safeguard religious and national sentiments by including a provision for rabbis to retain their prerogatives over the Jewish populace, as per the previous regime. Following news of the Bastille’s fall, rioters marched toward the local lord through the village of Uffholtz, where a fifth of the residents were Jewish. They launched an antisemitic pogrom, accusing the wealthiest resident, Samuel Manheimer, of usury. A grandson of former Zinswiller forge lessee Jacob Reichshoffer, Manheimer had married a daughter of the local Préposé. As local authorities failed to intervene, Manheimer secured military protection. With the growth of the community, a rabbinical cousin of Isaac Aron of Phalsbourg soon settled there. Rioters also loitered Cerf Berr’s granaries and vandalized his house and those of other Jews, Orchel participated in a delegation to Paris, advocating for equal civic rights for Jews. The French Revolution of 1789 spurred Austria into action. In 1790, Kaulla received a contract from Bishop Maximilian Christoph of Constance and the Duke of Württemberg to supply the Imperial Army in the Austrian Netherlands. By then, social reforms were well underway across the Empire. From 1772, Austria annexed Polish Galicia and imposed Austrian law. Reforms under Maria-Theresa and Joseph II included a 1775 directive limiting peasant labor to historical norms. Joseph II’s 1782 decree set labor limits of three days per week for full peasants with animals and three days without for half peasants. Since Primator of Bohemian rural Jews Joachim Popper and Rabbi Ezekiel Landau established modern Jewish schools in Prague in 1781, Emperor Joseph II reinforced his grandfather Charles VI’s restrictions on Jewish marriage, and forced locally regulated religious marriages to be civil contracts under state jurisdiction from 1783. Tensions grew as the state’s civil definitions clashed with Jewish religious interpretations, resulting in jurisdictional disputes. Although Israel Popper Hönig converted like his siblings in the 1770s, he surrendered his tobacco monopoly in 1783 per Emperor Joseph II’s wishes. He was then appointed as a councilor and tobacco director, cooperating with Fries and Nathan Arnstein to convert the former into the joint-stock Austrian State Tobacco Monopoly in 1788, altering trade dynamics among Bohemian rural Jews. By 1789, the Emperor granted Hönig the title of Austria’s first non-baptized Jewish noble. In Galicia, rather than work with guild-like kahals, Aryeh Bernstein imposed taxes and sold monopolies, including Brody merchant Nathansohn, whose son wed Bernstein’s daughter. And as Jewish Galician kahals protested to Vienna, which replaced the Galician Chief Rabbinate with political administration from 1785. The Edict of 1786 limited peasant labor and abolished serfdom in Galicia, with eased restrictions on marriage, industry, and trade. Inspired by Bohemian reforms, impact varied across regions, leading to peasant migration in some places. During Austria’s war against Turkey in 1788, Rabbi Ezekiel Landau’s son cooperated with the Emperor, endorsing reforms such as Jewish military service. In Galicia, the Edict of 1789 mandated all rabbis graduate from modern schools—like the one—within six years. Without heirs, Popper partnered with his nephew

magnate of North Wales, established Chester Old Bank. Coal mining activities in Holywell prompted the creation of North Wales Bank, while the bank of Fendal Jelf emerged in South Wales in 1791, focusing on colliery ventures at Abergwm. While the banking partnership that started with Freame and grew with Barclay came to include Bevan’s copper refining, London Lead Co, and other Quaker industries, Barclay bought Smyth out of a banking partnership in the 1770s, and Smyth branched to Lincoln and Hull by 1784, the latter a thriving port where Wilberforce and Thornton cousins long held political sway. The same year, a Thornton wed a metal merchant’s daughter. But a new opportunity presented to Abel Smyth, then head of Smyth. Since Abel married Jane Beaumont in 1745, her nephew married the daughter of William Blackett as he died in 1792. The Beaumonts then inherited Blackett’s Northumberland estate and one of Britain’s largest lead deposits. France, meanwhile, continued to extend liberties to religious minorities. Since France eased exclusions on Huguenots and Jews from guilds and allowed some to open shops from 1787, Isaac Orchel participated in a delegation to Paris in 1789, advocating for equal civic rights for Jews. Soon after, Cerf Berr’s apprentice, Lion Goudchaux’s third grandnephew Lion Fould, moved to Paris. As Lion Fould married an Oppenheim and Wertheim cousin Brillin, his brother married a Katz-descended third great niece of Glikl’s Levy-Wimpfen husband and an extended Goudchaux and Oppenheim cousin. After establishing a bank in Paris with advanced from Cerf Berr, Fould hired Moses Mendelssohn’s brother. Since discounted food during a famine of 1770, Goudchaux cousin-in-law and Lorraine merchant Hayem Worms married his son to a great-granddaughter of Lion Goudchaux, and settled in Paris by 1790, where he operated a hosiery business. After extending citizenship to the Sephardi of Bayonne and Bordeaux in 1790, Assembly did so for the Ashkenazi of Alsace and Lorraine in 1791. Marriages cemented bonds. In 1788, Isaac Orchel’s daughter married Garçon Gomperz Silny, a descendant of Lion Goudchaux’s brother and wealthy Kohanim in Metz, who founded a trading and banking house in Nancy. Another of Orchel’s daughters married Samuel, whose brother Wolff of Strasbourg was married to Cerf Beer’s daughter and became a Court Jew in Bonn in 1789. Since Cerf Berr’s niece wed David Aron of Phalsbourg in 1786, David’s brother Jonas married Sara Cerf, a Katz and Speyer cousin, in 1791. Like Jews could enter cities, so could foreigners move to France. Among others, Abraham Lazard led his family from Bohemia to Lorraine. Following French emancipation of the Jews, Prussia made Daniel Itzig-Jaffe her first Jewish citizen in 1791, allowing him to live in Berlin without rabbinical oversight. Likewise, the Habsburg Empire ennobled three Wertheim brothers starting in 1791. More than Josef Wertheim’s late dealings with Bavaria, the ennoblements stemmed from their family’s century of contribution since their grandfather Samson Wertheim. As the Emperor reappointed Amschel Goldschmidt Imperial Court Jew, he also promoted Protective Jew of the Imperial City of Mühlhausen-Phüringen and Abraham

Protestant brewers who had served in the city council. In 1789, he ventured into commodity brokering and married Johanna Velde, the possibly Mennonite daughter of a flax merchant. When the French revolutionary armies occupied Holland in 1794, Henry Hope fled to London with his movable assets, leaving his underwriter to manage the affairs of Hope. Henry Baring, Alex’s younger brother, was already in Philadelphia visiting William Bingham. With the Hopes settled in London, there was a need for suitable investments for the capital withdrawn from Holland. As Baring bought land from Bingham, both Alex and Henry married Bingham’s daughters. Following the fall of Holland in 1795, trade moved to Hamburg and deposits to Bank of Hamburg. Likewise, Goldsmid-in-laws Prager of London closed their Dutch branch and sent their merchandize to Hamburg. As Holland became a French vassal state in 1795, Catholics gained political rights. While Jews achieved legal equality in 1796, those in Curaçao waited for decades along with Black slaves for their emancipation. During this time, Borski diversified his business to become the largest commission trader in foreign securities, acting as the key Dutch agent for Russian loans from Baring and Hope. Fellow Christian banker DeSmeth reinforced kinterlinks with spinning textiles operators in Ghent in 1792 and 1797. Although Frankfurt prohibited him from starting a joint-stock bank in 1790—and continued to do so for decades—Lutheran German merchant bankers like Metzler of Frankfurt expanded into Catholic countries, with branches in Bordeaux and Vienna. Friedrich Metzler served as personal banker for King Ferdinand IV of Sicily, Maria-Theresa’s son-in-law. Since Cerf Berr died in 1793, his sons partnered with Daniel Itzig-Jaffe to supply ten thousand horses to the French army. While Boyd Ker in Paris collapsed in 1793 before a partner was guillotined, Edouard Walckiers and Robert Herries remained in business. But with French forces clashing with Austria and occupying Belgium, Walckiers fled to Hamburg in 1794 to evade an arrest warrant issued by Convention. From Hamburg, Walckiers leveraged his family’s connections in Brussels to supply the French army with grain and provisions, both to regain favor and to profit from the poor French harvests. However, his efforts were soon undercut by competitor Jean-Baptiste Paulée. Since the Bavarian Elector appointed David Oppenheim of Mannheim as Court War Factor in 1785, Markus Oppenheim of Frankfurt became Electoral Palatinate-Bavarian Court Factor in 1791. Likewise, the Oppenheims reinforced bonds with Austro-German Court Jews. Possibly a relative of Joseph-Süss Oppenheim, Breslau-born Salomon Haber married a Baden Court Jew heiress, and became Court Jew of Baden by 1794. Since Julie Weisweiller Goldschmidt, Joseph Goldschmidt’s third great-granddaughter, married Isaac Landauer, a Brillin Oppenheim descendant and possibly a Landau cousin, in 1793, Mayer Rothschild’s daughter married Oppenheim and Orchel cousin Benedict d’Worms in 1795, and Rothschild funded Austrian campaigns against France with his extended cousin Nehm Oppenheim Rindskopf of Frankfurt, whose daughter soon married a Goldschmidt as Napoleon invaded Frankfurt in 1796, destroying the ghetto. While French assignats inflated in the 1790s, Directory replaced Convention in 1795. As Walckiers

relative of Joseph-Süss Oppenheim, Breslau-born Salomon Haber married a Baden Court Jew heiress, and became Court Jew of Baden by 1794. Since Julie Weisweiller Goldschmidt, Joseph Goldschmidt’s third great-granddaughter, married Isaac Landauer, a Brillin Oppenheim descendant and possibly a Landau cousin, in 1793, Mayer Rothschild’s daughter married Oppenheim and Orchel cousin Benedict d’Worms in 1795, and Rothschild funded Austrian campaigns against France with his extended cousin Nehm Oppenheim Rindskopf of Frankfurt, whose daughter soon married a Goldschmidt as Napoleon invaded Frankfurt in 1796, destroying the ghetto. While French assignats inflated in the 1790s, Directory replaced Convention in 1795. As Walckiers petitioned for payment in December 1795, but months of delays led to his bankruptcy in May 1796. He later took a clerk position and died in obscurity. Also in late 1795, Cerf Berr’s sons refused to accept assignats and loan money to Napoleon, they were forced to liquidate their company in 1796, which led to Itzig-Jaffe's bankruptcy. Both families faced financial ruin, but Itzig-Jaffe retained some reputation. As Itzig-Jaffe died in 1799, most of his sons fell into insolvency. But his daughters and trainee Joseph Mendelssohn, Moses’ son, thrived. As the Mughal Empire continued to crumble, the British advanced. Warring with Mysore in the south from 1780, EIC borrowed funds from banker Kashmiri Mai of Benares in the north. Likewise, branching to Cuttack and Madras, the Das family of Benares bought EIC paper during Mysore wars through 1790. In Surat, in the west, Hindu and Jain castes specializing in commercial activities were led by seths. While the Jain Jagat Seths recovered from short term crunches due to war, they declined with the rising competition of Hindu commercial castes as regional regimes consolidated and favored merchant-bankers with close ties to emerging dynasties. As Hindus gained power in the trading and financial system of Surat, tensions with the Muslim ruling elite and artisans culminated in the Surat riots of 1795. However, as British bankers grew, Benares’ banking influence declined by the early 19th century, some of the Das family shifted to landholding. As Napoleon invaded Italy in 1797, central banks collapsed in Genoa and Venice, and the rush to silver drove a premium on Austria’s paper money. Napoleon gained from Genoa’s loss. Since fleeing France in 1667, Andre established a dynasty of Huguenot bankers in Genoa. Initially focused on trade, Andre left Genoa after French invasion in 1797 for Paris by 1800. He began investing into government loans and industry. (In 1847, Andre kinterlinked with the Neuflize family. Descended from cloth manufactures ennobled by Louis XV, Neuflizes heirs eventually took over Andre and renamed her Neuflize.) Without Italy, Austria depended on Bohemia. Since the deaths of Landau, Popper, Emperor Joseph, and his brother Leopold II, Austria revised the 1781 law only with the Edict of Toleration of 1797 for Bohemian Jews. With the same law, Austria eliminated the rabbinic judiciary by prohibiting excommunication and mandating a secular education for rabbis—in the school Landau and Popper had established in 1781—like the Galician law

Since the deaths of Landau, Popper, Emperor Joseph, and his brother Leopold II, Austria revised the 1781 law only with the Edict of Toleration of 1797 for Bohemian Jews. With the same law, Austria eliminated the rabbinic judiciary by prohibiting excommunication and mandating a secular education for rabbis—in the school Landau and Popper had established in 1781—like the Galician law of 1789. In France, Cerf Berr’s grandson converted in 1794 and became the first general of Jewish origin during the First French Empire. While Berr’s son married Isaac Orchel’s daughter in 1800, Berr’s brother-in-law Rabbi David Sinzheim became first Grand Rabbi of the Consistory of Paris. Kinterlinking with French-allied Bavarian Jews, Isaac Orchel’s niece married a Seligmann by 1803. Since Jonas Aron of Phalsbourg married Katz-cousin Sara Cerf in 1791, brothers Jacob and Garçon Silny wed their cousin Isaac Orchel’s daughter in 1788 and Parisian hosiery merchant Hayem Worms in 1793, who became deputy mayor in 1799. Their families joined the war effort. Aaron Lazard rose to artillery sergeant major, his brother, Mayer, served in Saint-Domingue. While one of Isaac Orchel’s brothers became a major, another was a member of the Legion of Honor. As Michel Goudchaux became first midshipman class, his brother made lieutenant. Similarly, Louis Mayer Marx was a wagon corps officer. Like Louis Aron—son of a Préposé of Phalsbourg and son-in-law of Michel Orchel Wolff—Louis Goudchaux became indigent over the following decade, surviving only through charity, and deriving glory from the military bravery of his sons and cousin. After Turkish closed ports to stop the spread of Republican ideals, Sina and other Armenians continued trading using caravans and expanded into Bosnia. As Austrian bank notes hyperinflated, Sina sold Turkish cotton and wool into Vienna during the naval blockades for metal currency and invest in cheap properties. And in Hungary, another Court Jew family thrived. While Samuel Oppenheim relied on extended Gunzburg cousin Samuel Ulman as Court Jew of Bavaria, some of Ulman’s descendants branched to Frankfurt, Augsburg, Fürth, and elsewhere, Ulmans became rabbis and kinterlinked with other prominent families. In Austrian Hungary, Mor, a son of one rabbinical Ulman and a Schlesinger, migrated to Pest, where he married a Hirschel and became a trader of grain, wool, salt, and leather. Likewise, Mor’s cousin-once removed married the son of a Schlesinger and descendant of the Mandl Prefects of Hungarian Jews. Jews also linked trade Austrian through key trade routes. In Hungary, Fejér served as a key meeting point for merchants traveling between Vienna, Zagreb, Transdanubia, and Transylvania. In the 18th century, local landowners invited Jewish settlers. While most came from Moravia, the Baumgarten family arrived from Württemberg during Empress Maria-Theresa’s reign and settled in Fejér. Israel Baumgarten soon became a merchant in grain and wool and served as

his widow Anna became his heir and guardian of their children. In 1783, her son Hendrik reached legal majority and, with Anna, founded Widow Croese & Son to trade goods and securities. In 1789, Anna transferred management to Hendrik and the firm became bankers to the Spanish Crown in 1798. Women also helped reform society. From the 1790s, the Itzig-Jaffe sisters, Moses Mendelssohn, and other wealthy Berliners began hosting salons to break social and religious boundaries through conversation. Samuel Zbytkower’s wife Judith hosted similar salons in Prussian Warsaw, as the King granted the family the privilege to acquire real estate in Warsaw and across the Kingdom. After expanding into grain to feed the Prussian army, widow Levy increased Prussian coin production in 1799, Daniel Itzig-Jaffe’s daughter Cecilia divorced to marry Bernhard Eskeles. That year Moses Hirschel of Breslau, petitioned to renounce the Jewish religion, seeking a new form of Prussian citizenship. In 1798, Tsar Paul Romanov appointed Christian Voute Velho Rall as Court bankers and foreign trade commission agents. The company comprised of Pierre Voute—nephew of Hope’s affiliate— Jose Pedro Celestino Velho, a Portuguese wine merchant, and Rall, a large textile mill owner kinterlinked with a Saint-Petersburg trading company. As Voute suddenly resigned months later, he was succeeded by Nikolai Rogovikov, son of a Imperial State Bank Saint-Petersburg director and passementerie factory owner. While French assignats inflated in the 1790s, Directory replaced Convention in 1795 and deflated assignats. Surviving the upheaval of 1794, Pierre DuPont engaged in politics. However, he was imprisoned following an anti-royalist coup of late 1797, which also mandated emigrants depart from France. Questioning France’s prospects, DuPont raised capital from shareholders with the aid of Huguenot banker Bidermann to buy and developing land in Virginia’s western area and set up bank and export offices in Virginia and New York before immigrating there as Consulat seized power from Directory under General Napoleon Bonaparte in late 1799. Although Huguenots funded the revolutionary regimes, Négociants Réunis—mostly Catholic financiers and merchants including Claude Périer, Florentin Seillière, Gabriel Ouvrard, and Perregaux’s Jacques Laffitte—organized Bank of France (“BDF”) to support the new regime to not rely on Huguenots. When Claude Périer died in 1801, his son Antoine became a BDF Regent and parlayed Anzin’s mining profits to found the Paris bank Périer. From a Lorraine textile trading family, Florentin Seillière led the management of the Pierrepont factory near Longuyon. In 1789, Seillière obtained a 15-year lease for the Ruelle cannon foundry in Charente. By 1795, he shifted his focus to banking, first in Nancy, and, from 1798, in Paris. Continuing to supply the army, Florentin’s son Nicolas arranged supplier credits, bond loans, and guarantees for military contracts by 1799. Along with Hottinguer, the Court of BDF’s Huguenots included Jean-Frédéric Perregaux. Since moving to Paris in 1765, Perregaux established his Paris bank Perregaux, representing Isaac Panchaud and gaining wealth during the American Revolution. After marrying the heir of co-religionist Nicolas Beaujon, who had served King Louis XV through Beaujon Goossens alongside Court Banker Jean-Joseph

1795. After her brother, the mayor of Strasbourg was guillotined in 1793, Huguenot Amélie Dietrich inherited Dietrich, France’s third-largest iron forge, but her husband managed the enterprise until his death in 1806, when Amélie took over. Similarly, Nicole-Barbe Cliquot took over her late husband’s champagne house in 1805, and later defied Napoleon by sending secret shipments to Russia. After the revolution, she married her daughter to a count as her competitor, Moët, kinterlinked with the Chandon family of magistrates with aristocratic ties. Since widow Helen Krupp took over the family business and invested in Rhenish mining companies, she refused to relinquish managerial authority to her son until her death in 1810. The following year, her grandson Friedrich founded Krupp to produce English cast steel during Napoleon’s Continental Blockade. After the partners’ steelmaking efforts failed, Friedrich took sole control in 1816 but struggled financially. Following Friedrich’s death in 1826, his widow Therese and their son Alfred continued operations. As Napoleon made his way through Europe, Austrian finance reinforced familial bonds. Since an heiress of the Austrian Mint Jew Duschenes family married Simon Lämel, a Bohemian descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe. In 1787, Simon was granted residence in Prague and founded a wholesale trading house, entering the wool trade. Likewise, his siblings kinterlinked with Bondi, Oppenheim Königswarter in-law of the Arnsteins, and Wertheim heirs. From 1801, he served as a military supplier, acquiring goods for the Austrian military and treasury from advancing French forces. Likewise, Austria’s gentile bankers kinterlinked as a Fries son marrying an aristocratic cousin of fellow Fugger descendant Prince Schwarzenberg in 1801. However, as Napoleon invaded Austria and Germany, inflation spread in the Panic of 1806. After he decreed a moratorium on debts owed by peasants to protect them from Jewish usurers, he convened the Assembly of Notables to reform Jewish practices and reduce reliance on usury. While Count Molé recommended stripping them of civil rights, veteran council members supported integration under the principles of equality established by the Revolution. The Assembly of Notables led to the Grand Sanhedrin, with representatives including Jewish rabbis and bankers across the empire under the presidency of Rabbi David Sintzheim, By 1808, decrees formalized the organization of Jewish communities in France, reaffirming the structure established by the Assembly of Notables, imposing strict regulations on loans, commerce, conscription, and residency. Likewise, Napoleon limited speculation with his Commercial Code. As Huguenots continued to select godparents to reinforce trust bonds, the concept did not exist for Jews. However, Napoleon secularized marriage witnessing, and French Jews adopted the practice. With the dissolution of the thousand-year-old German Empire, Württemberg became a kingdom and allowed Kaulla to move to Stuttgart. Among the first Jews allowed into Würzburg during the Napoleonic Wars after centuries, Jacob Hirsch-Gereuth (“Hirsch”) became Bavaria’s Court Jew, he became the first Jew to gain freedom of movement in 1806. Allying with Napoleon, Bavaria enlarged and absorbed self-ruled cities. Invading Europe and Turkey, Napoleon’s Code replaced primogeniture with partible inheritance to fracture political control.

Born in Bleicherode, Benedicks worked for Jakob Gomperz and the Prussian War Commissariat before joining Isak in Stockholm. After his wife died, Benedicks married Henriette Halle of Hamburg in 1804 and co-founded jewelry factory Benedicks. Benedicks managed state purchases in London during the wars of 1808 and 1812. He and his brother Wilhelm became Swedish citizens by decree in 1811 and burghers three years later, followed by antisemitic agitation. Wilhelm married Josephine Seligmann in 1816, before her sister married Alex Mendelssohn in 1821. By then, Benedicks had bought the iron works of Gysinge. Likewise, after Jeremiah Katz (of unknown relationship to the other Katz) became a Protected Jew of Schwaan, Mecklenburg, in 1757, his son Philip moved to Sweden in 1789 and settled in Norrköping in 1790. From two wives, Philip’s sons adopted the surname Philipson. While giving permission to his eldest Carl to marry a Gentile in 1813 and become an industrialist in Linköping, Philip’s other son Jacob became a wholesaler in Norrköping, and his son Mauritz followed the family trade. In 1822, half-brothers Jacob and Mauritz Philipson became partners in their father’s firm, Philip. Jacob focused on agriculture, cattle breeding, and dairy management, while Mauritz engaged in publishing and banking. Through the late 18th century, Saint-Petersburg was Russia’s most developed port city. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Schröder spread from Hamburg and Amsterdam to Saint-Petersburg, Riga, and London to import Russian grain. Following the death of Rall Rogovikov’s Rogovikov’s death in 1809, Velho’s in-law Severin assumed his Court Banker position. However, Rall Severin gradually lost Hope’s respect. While Alex Rall retained his court banker role until 1817, when he ceded to Ludwig Stiglitz’s Stiglitz. After Hirsch Stiglitz became the Court Jew of Waldeck in the late 18th century, his nephews Phillip and Jacob Mark migrated to New York. The brothers served as the Paymaster of the Waldeck mercenary troops during the Revolution and engaged in the Dutch trade by 1785. Dissolving the partnership with his brother in 1793, Jacob partnered with John Speyer (of a likely but unknown relation to Speyer), while brother Phillip accepted President George Washington’s appointment as the American consul for Franconia. Subsequently, Hirsch Stiglitz’s son Joseph joined Phillip in New York in 1796. Anglicizing his name to Sterlitz, and forming Mark Sterlitz together. Soon after, Mark Speyer failed in 1799, with creditors including James Roosevelt and John Murray. Mark Sterlitz never recovered after Phillip’s death. Hirsch Stiglitz’s other sons that remained in Europe had grander successes. While one son converted in 1793 to marry an Ephraim—descended from the siblings of Glikl, Joseph Goldschmidt, Koppel Frankel, and was a cousin-in-law of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe and Moses Mendelsohn—and served as Court doctor, another wed a Heine cousin after establishing Saint-Petersburg bank Stiglitz in 1803 with a third brother to export flax to London for textiles. Stiglitz’s co-founder, Peter Klein, had married a Gentile Mahs of Hamburg and Saint-Petersburg. After resuming construction of the Port of Odessa in the Black Sea, Russia exempted all imports from taxes and, following

Hirsch Stiglitz’s other sons that remained in Europe had grander successes. While one son converted in 1793 to marry an Ephraim—descended from the siblings of Glikl, Joseph Goldschmidt, Koppel Frankel, and was a cousin-in-law of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe and Moses Mendelsohn—and served as Court doctor, another wed a Heine cousin after establishing Saint-Petersburg bank Stiglitz in 1803 with a third brother to export flax to London for textiles. Stiglitz’s co-founder, Peter Klein, had married a Gentile Mahs of Hamburg and Saint-Petersburg. After resuming construction of the Port of Odessa in the Black Sea, Russia exempted all imports from taxes and, following lobbying from Greek merchants, declared her a free port. Led by a Frenchmen, Odessa soon attracted French and Greek investment. With settlement facilitated by Prince Gregory Potemkin after the Russo-Turkish War (1768-1774). Potemkin’s policy allowed Jews, previously banned from Russia until 1772, to settle in Odessa. The community quickly established a cemetery in 1793, a charitable brotherhood in 1795, and a formal community in 1798, with the main synagogue on Jewish Street. Odessa’s Jewish community, founded in 1798, was a newcomer compared to the long-established Jewish centers in the Polish-Lithuania, such as Wilna, Minsk, and Volozhin, and thousands of tiny shtetls ruled by Hasidic courts, like as Liady, Lubavitch, and Chernobyl. Without ‘native’ Jewish traditions, Galician Jewry brought the Haskalah to Odessa without local opposition. So, instead of traditional Jewish learning, the Port Jewry of Odessa functioned as a kind of ‘anti-shtetl.’ Attracting modern Jewish intellectuals, Odessa’s thriving grain trade led to a diverse Jewish population involved in various economic roles. Since Tsarina Catherine II granted the Rafalovich surname to Moshe Pernas in 1783, his sons Kalman and Solomon expanded to Nikolayev, Mogilev, and Tarnopol, while Abraham banked and traded grain in the newly founded Odessa. As Hasidism spread, Abraham Rafalovich adopted it. So did Berdichev, the once Radziwill-owned fair town that competed with Odessa for trade, like Orla did with Bialystok, where Jews gained permission to live on the Polish-Belarus border. Together with the Pale cities of Grodno, Wilna, Shklov, and Bialystok, Berdichev played a pivotal role in trade and banking. By the 1810s, Abraham Rafalovich married his cousin Olga Lowensohn, of a rabbinical family including child prodigy Isaac Levinsohn. Along with Mark Gunzburg, Levinsohn was considered ‘Russian Mendelssohn’ and the founder of the Haskalah in Russia. They continued marrying one-another. Among the most prominent Berdichev pioneers was Israel Friedman, Hasidic royalty though his Baal Shem-Tov disciple forefathers Maggid of Mezhirech and the Katz-descendant Chief Rabbi of Chernobyl Nahum Twersky, who established Hasidic dynasties in Ukrainian shtetls. So did their in-laws, including Friedman’s uncle-in-laws, possibly descendants of Samson Wertheim, who established dynasties near Odessa and in Moldova. After marrying a fellow Katz-descendant of Habsburg Emperor Rudolf II’s Mint Jew Mark Meisel—in 1810, Friedman arrived in Berdichev in 1813 and joined the Second Merchants’ Guild. As his wealth grew, so did his messianic aura and international followers after he became the Rabbi of Ruzhin. Long before Friedman caught the ire

Spanish merchant-speculators, like Basque-born Antonio Bassoco, amassed fortunes. Their ventures encompassed diverse investments ranging from the China and Philippine trades to mining, public funds, livestock, and plantations. Despite the undulating tides of the economy, their endeavors have etched a lasting imprint upon the financial landscape of New Spain. Over the course of centuries marked by intermarriage, most of Mexico’s nobility had evolved into a distinct lineage by the time of Mexico’s declaration of independence from Spain in 1821. Adorned with titles and privileges, this interwoven network of families wielded sway over governance, mining, and financial affairs. Basque intermarriage networks were crucial in integrating public and private credit and industry. This blending of interests was evident across Spanish America. Families used urban and rural resources, solidifying networks through marriage. Even after gaining independence from Spain, these networks persisted, connecting old and new elite families through marriages and business collaborations. In 1828, Argentina’s first public bank was formed, Banco de la Provincia, formed in Buenos Aires. A large percentage of subscribers were Casares and other second-generation Basque descendants. They later assumed leadership roles. Among the wealthiest subscribers to Banco de la Provincia, most came from colonial merchants and marriages. Casares and his cousins later co-founded the first railroad. Likewise, Argentine aristocracy kinterlinked with German Lutherans. While his brother remained in Westphalia, becoming a Lutheran pastor and marrying a Krupp, and Johann Bunge founded Bunge in Amsterdam in 1818 to trade Dutch colonial goods. Likewise, Lynch Zimmermann founded Zimmermann. By 1822, Discount Bank of Buenos Aires formed with Sebastian Lezica as a director. In 1824, Zimmermann Frazier succeeded Zimmermann to trade Argentine wool trade with Continental markets. Although Lezica rivaled Zimmermann connections, his cousin married Johann Bunge’s nephew Carlos by 1831. As Bunge dominated the Argentine trade, Carlos served as Consul General of Prussia and the Netherlands. Immigrating from Ireland to Baltimore, Alex Brown opened a trading firm in Baltimore in 1800. Along with sending his sons to Liverpool in 1810, Philadelphia in 1818, and New York in 1825, the family partnered with Quaker Joseph Shipley in London, soon creating Brown Shipley. In 1831, Brown co-founded Bank of Liverpool with the Unitarian cotton broker Holt. While Brown’s James Brown had married the daughter of a minister’s daughter, she died in 1829. By 1831, he married the daughter of a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church in Troy, New York. His daughter later married Howard Potter, whose father and brother became the bishops of Pennsylvania and New York in later years. As BOE regulated joint-stock banks, only MMBU brokering merchant banks led BOE to promote trade over inflation. Without paying gold, the banks funded trade. Along with Reid Irving and other Scots, Barclay and Lloyd merchant banks and insurer funded trade, Quakers dominated domestic banking. As the Navy reneged on timber contracts, war disrupted imports, and Parliament tariffed steel. So, banks financed coal. Meanwhile, whale oil faced competition.

Howard Potter, whose father and brother became the bishops of Pennsylvania and New York in later years. As BOE regulated joint-stock banks, only MMBU brokering merchant banks led BOE to promote trade over inflation. Without paying gold, the banks funded trade. Along with Reid Irving and other Scots, Barclay and Lloyd merchant banks and insurer funded trade, Quakers dominated domestic banking. As the Navy reneged on timber contracts, war disrupted imports, and Parliament tariffed steel. So, banks financed coal. Meanwhile, whale oil faced competition. After William Murdoch demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing coal gas for illumination in 1792, Baltimore and Richmond demonstrated gas lighting in 1802 and 1803. Meanwhile, in London, coal-based gas public utilities (“PUs”) took shape with the incorporation of the first London Gas Co in 1810 and City of London Gas Light & Coke Co in 1817. As cotton mills of Newport, Rhode Island, illuminated by 1817, American cities chartered Gas Light Co of Baltimore in 1816, followed by Boston Gas Light Co in 1822, and New York Gas Light Co in 1825. While Jewish farmers in Boryslaw of Austrian Galicia extracted crude oil to lubricate wagon wheels by the 1770s, oversupply after the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 prompted Boryslaw Jews to produce oil for light. With licenses from Vienna and Prague, they illuminated the streets around Boryslaw by 1817. By 1819, BOE made banks resume pound gold payouts. Deflation spread business failures and accelerated capitalism. As Bank of Ireland, under the governorship of brewer Arthur Guinness, rescued Touche and other Dublin private banks during the Panic of 1820, banking crisis, reforms allowed bankers outside of the capital to have more than six shareholders. That year, Reid Irving’s John Reid joined BOE as a director, which he remained on for decades, continuing to participate in foreign loans with Rothschild, Baring, and Hope. As Mocatta Goldsmid resumed her gold brokering monopoly for servicing BOE, Rothschild repaid her gold loan to the heirs of the Landgrave of Hesse since 1823. Through the panic, bankers and trusts replaced whale oil by funding coal-based gas PUs for street lights and Spanish American mines. But as the Master & Servant Act of 1823 criminalized broken labor contracts, courts imprisoned miners. So, Parliament legalized labor unions, lowered tariffs, and ended monopoly from 1720. Unions combined with judicial refusal to aid trusts into the Panic of 1825. Amidst bank failures and strikes, Rothschild’s loan allowed BOE to avoid suspension. Trade fell as BOE hiked rates. So, Parliament banned unions, repealed the Bubbles Act, and eased the Navigation Acts. Only after this wave of failures did BOE Birmingham form in 1827, the first of many branches outside of London. In Austria, Fries failed without aid from Rothschild Vienna, leading a partner to commit suicide. As Arnstein Eskeles took over Fries, Fries descendants kinterlinked with Arnstein Eskeles’ ennobled converted descendants of Katz, Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, and Samson Wertheim. And in Bremen, Meinertzhagen failed in 1826, forcing Daniel Meinertzhagen to move to London and join Huth, where his
