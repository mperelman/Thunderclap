Congressional acts combine category and year. Holding companies and corporations identified with \u201cHC\u201d. \u201cMM\u201d prefixes identify short-term liquid debt money markets. Names of people are not <italic>italicized</italic>, but <italic>firm</italic> names are and do not use definite articles. Some other institutional proper nouns are also <italic>italicized</italic>. Acronyms are generally not <italic>italicized</italic>. Descendancy is usually direct. Cousinhood is often of the first order, unless a surname, then usually implies several marriages between the surnamed families. Middle names are either maternal or maiden surnames. Some surnames have been changed for differentiation from others (e.g., Smith to Smyth).\n\n<italic>Panics of Eur</italic><italic>asian </italic><italic>Colonization</italic>\nAlthough banknotes in Vienna had recovered somewhat relative to silver since <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> halted redemptions during the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, pawn letters in the Austrian switched from trading at a premium to banknotes to a discount. Despite the shortage of silver and banknotes in the provinces, demand had grown since farms needed to pay emancipated serfs for labor. So, since the first discount branch opened in Prague in 1847, <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> followed with branches Budapest in 1851; Linz in 1852; Lemberg, Br\u00fcnn, and Trieste in 1853; Olomouc, Troppau, and Kronstadt in 1854; Graz and Klagenfurt in 1855; Krakau, Ljubljana, Fiume, Debreczin, Temesv\u00e1r, and Reichenberg in 1856; and, finally, Innsbruck in 1857. \nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>, British Queen Victoria began arranging marriages for her six children and later her thirty grandchildren to link the crowns of Britain, Germany, Spain, Russia, and others. Starting with her eldest, Victoria\u2019s daughter Vicky married the heir to the Prussian throne in 1858. Although Junker Otto Bismarck became a conservative antisemitic politician in the newly created Prussian legislature of 1847, he became Prussia\u2019s Ambassador to Russia and France by 1857 and sought a Jewish banker. Upon the recommendation of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, Bismarck hired Gerson Bleichr\u00f6der. \nSoon after <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> began stabilizing German coal and iron with cartels. As French backers abandoned the insolvent <italic>Belgium-Luxembourg</italic> RR, <italic>Hirsch</italic> saved the company in 1859 by convincing Otto Bismarck of its strategic importance. Since the Prussian government owned the Ruhr and Saar coal lands, and Bleichr\u00f6der suggested to Bismarck that the Saar coal be privatized. According to reports, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris was interested in acquiring the Saar coal mines since 1861, but Bismarck declined. Instead, Bismarck entrusted Bleichr\u00f6der to begin buying private coal roads competing with the state. From 1862, Bismarck served Prussia as PM.\nAmerica\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic> spurred emancipation progressed for European Jewry. From 1860 several German states made significant strides in Jewish emancipation. In 1861, Bavaria lifted trade restrictions on Jews, followed by W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019s similar reforms. In 1862, Baden granted full legal equality to Jews. Saxony passed its emancipation law in 1863, followed by Frankfurt a year later. \nUnlike the forced industrialization of Saxony, Frankfurt only freed trade in 1864, approving the private joint-stock <italic>Frankfurter Vereinskasse</italic> (since <italic>Frankfurter Bank</italic> absorbed the one from) and allowing foreign banks to open branches, with the first being <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>. However, industrial development faced opposition from the merchant and banking class. One of the first entrepreneurs, was Joseph Wertheim. Of unknown relation to Samson Wertheim, Joseph migrated from Hessian Rotenburg to New York and worked at <italic>Singer</italic> in 1854. Moving to Frankfurt in 1861, he married Rosalie Ballin. With the reforms of 1864, Wertheim established his own sewing machine production and soon became <italic>Singer</italic>\u2019s main competitor.\nIn Russia, the movements spurred another revolt in Russian Poland. Leo Kronenberg helped form the City Delegation during the 1861 political turmoil in Warsaw, which followed Russian troops firing on demonstrators, with Russia splintering revolutionaries into religious and national emancipation, and fueling antisemitism. While Kronenberg funded Russia\u2019s military amidst the Uprising of 1863, Wladyslaw Gutman Rawicz\u2014whose father had transformed <italic>Zbytkower</italic> into <italic>Hirschendorf Rawicz</italic> in 1825\u2014was hanged by Russia for his participation. As Rawicz\u2019s cousin once removed soon married Kronenberg\u2019s cousin, the Russian government limited the involvement of Polish Catholics in the military and civic positions in Poland and Western Russia. \nWhile beginning to limit freedom of the press through censorship, Russia reassessed the role of minorities, especially with the end of serfdom in the countryside. By 1864, serf-descendent <italic>Eliseev</italic> helped start and run <italic>Saint-Petersburg Private Commercial Bank</italic>, Russia\u2019s first joint-stock bank, provided loans on government bonds, guaranteed railway loans, and other <italic>Saint-Petersburg Stock Exchange</italic> securities. While laws allowed Jewish who were First Guild merchants, university graduates, and skilled artisans to exit the <italic>Pale</italic> and live anywhere in the Empire, Jews were prohibited from acquiring, renting, or managing lands in northeast and southwest. \nMeanwhile, Britain\u2019s Parliament spurred liberalizing corporations by limiting investor liability. Prior to 1844 and 1855, joint-stock enterprise for trading and manufacturing was prohibited by English law. The law of corporations, which granted privileges and limited liability, didn\u2019t apply to ordinary trading ventures. The 1844 Registration Act allowed companies to be registered, providing legal recognition. The 1855 Act introduced limited liability, replacing unlimited liability for shareholders. The Acts of 1858 and 1862 enabled joint stock banking companies to be formed with limited liability. \nThese Acts extended limited liability to banking companies with seven or more members, encouraging the formation of Imperial banks, often without any official connection. As lower investment risk reducing shareholder risk, a \u2018Colonial bank mania\u2019 started in 1862, increasing competition. While Parliament segregated laborers by sex before extending free incorporation with the<italic> </italic>Act of 1844, British women accounted for 31% of the labor force in 1861, the labor force participation level that would not return until 1961. \nAlthough Napoleon III had advocated for an act like Britain\u2019s Act of 1862 a year earlier in France, he was unable to implement it for another five years for it.  Similarly, since French women lost the right to vote and hold political office in 1791, their commercial and administrative jobs were often limited to subordinate roles like shorthand typists, paid less than men, and frequently hired based on family connections rather than merit, including at <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, and BDF.\nWhile <italic>Mobilier</italic> financed Paris gas public utilities mergers under Franco-Swiss <italic>Parent Schake</italic> into <italic>Parisienne du Gaz</italic> in 1855, French investors developed gas in Naples, which ruled by a usually friendly Bourbon regime. However, Italian unification in 1861 jeopardized that link. Within a year, <italic>Parent Schake</italic> consolidated Naples\u2019 gas industry. \nNorth of there, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels cousin <italic>Schott Weill </italic>expanded from commerce in Milan to banking with <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Brussels partners. In 1867, they opened <italic>Schott Weill</italic> Florence, as their sister married Enrico Guastalla, a Jewish soldier under Garibaldi and later a politician, cementing ties with Francesco Crispi as he led the branch. The same year, <italic>Rothschild</italic> hired <italic>Schott Weill</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s uncle to manage her Naples office since dissolving <italic>Rothschild</italic> Naples in 1863. After Jewish banker and Morpurgo in-law Ignazio Weil Weiss was ennobled in 1870 and his daughter married a noble, he became one of few nobles to invest in several banks as Catholic nobles generally did not invest.\nMeanwhile, the Vatican preferred Catholic financier Andre Langrand, who soon won Church property sale contracts over Rothschild. Born in Belgium, Langrand established insurers, banks, and <italic>Mobilier</italic>-affiliated railways. Calling to unite Catholic capital, Langrand gained support from clergy and royalty. One of allies, Henri Germain, came from a wealthy Catholic Lyons family and traded silk and stock before launching <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais </italic>in 1863. After the death of his first wife, Germain married the daughter of Adolphe Vuitry, former minister of Napoleon III and BDF Governor. As he moved to Paris, he was elected to Parliament and opened a <italic>Lyonnais</italic> branch in the capital at the end of the decade. \nWhile Germain was with involved in <italic>Mines de Montramebert</italic>, <italic>Hauts-Fourneaux de Marseille</italic>, <italic>Forges de Commentry</italic>, and <italic>Ateliers de la Buire</italic>, other founding directors included head of <italic>Forges de Terrenoire</italic> Jullien, Chair <italic>of Forges de Commentry</italic> and Firminy steel plant director Ferouillat, <italic>de la Marine</italic>\u2019s Br\u00f4lemann, <italic>Hauts-fourneaux de Chasse</italic>\u2019s Bouthier, Basset of <italic>Forges de Commentry</italic> and<italic> Forges de Saint-Etienne</italic>, <italic>Aci\u00e9ries </italic>and Desseilligny of <italic>Creusot</italic> and <italic>Decazeville</italic>. 70 out of the 353 shareholders of the bank were Swiss Huguenots. \nBy 1864, <italic>Imperial Counter for Public Works, Trade, & Industry</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 large discount and loan bank of 1856, reorged into<italic> Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de</italic> <italic>Paris</italic> (\u201c<italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>\u201d) with <italic>Rothschild </italic>Paris, Bischoffsheim\u2019s in-law Joseph Cah\u00e9n, <italic>Blount Laffitte</italic>, Henri Hentsch, railway, and metal cartel industries. While public works contractor <italic>Parent</italic> directed both <italic>Industriel</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, Chief of <italic>Creusot</italic> Schneider was for many years Chair of the bank and France\u2019s first major coal and iron cartel. Within a year, France finally legalized the British practice of check payment that <italic>Thomson Bonar</italic>\u2019s William Gladstone had lobbied for years. <italic>Lyonnais</italic> and investment bank <italic>Industriel</italic> soon led branched deposit banking. \nAs Langrand imitated the French <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic> internationally, he promoted Britain\u2019s first mortgage bank with Lord Salisbury and Drummond Wolff as promoters, <italic>International Land & Credit</italic>. While Wolff was ashamed of his Jewish heritage, his father Joseph had left his father Rabbi David Levi of Bavaria to convert and study Christianity across Europe. After securing the aid of Scottish banker Henry Drummond, to fund his missionary work in Russian Central Asia, Joseph married the grandniece of Robert Walpole, Britain\u2019s first PM, in 1827. \nLikewise, <italic>Mobilier</italic> formed a British affiliate\u2014<italic>International Financial Society</italic>\u2014with the involvement of its Spanish, Dutch, and Italian affiliates, and London bankers who had previously collaborated on Pereire ventures, including Junius Morgan, <italic>Huth</italic>, <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen</italic>, and Rothschild, Speyer, and Goldsmid cousins <italic>Stern</italic> in 1863. <italic>Baring</italic> refused to join<italic>.</italic> (New Granada-focused merchant bank <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen</italic>\u2019s George G\u00f6schen entered Parliament for the City of London in 1863 and was appointed to the Privy Council two years later.)\nAmidst his entrepreneurism, Langrand founded an insurer in Vienna with Maurice Wertheim Hirsch in 1858, who him had been investing in insurers from Austria to Amsterdam. The grandson of Bavarian Court Jew Jacob Hirsch and Samson Wertheim\u2019s descendant, Karolina, Maurice joined <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> <italic>Goldschmidt</italic> in 1851. Only after Maurice came up with a simple solution for a complex government financing problem did Bischoffsheim consent for Maurice to marry his daughter Clara in 1855. That year, <italic>Bischoffsheim </italic>and<italic> Hirsch</italic> joined <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>Eichthal</italic>, and Bavaria\u2019s public <italic>State Bank</italic> to finance <italic>Bayerische </italic>RR, linking N\u00fcrnberg-Regensburg, M\u00fcnchen-Regensburg-Passau. After co-founding <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> <italic>Cassel</italic> <italic>Hirsch</italic><italic> </italic>of London in 1857, Maurice joined his brother-in-law to start <italic>Bischoffsheim Hirsch</italic> in Brussels in 1862. \nStill, Dutch commerce lagged Antwerp and Belgian railways. In the 1840s, economic liberalism dominated Dutch policy, opposing state involvement in industry. In 1856, four proposals for a cr\u00e9dit mobilier type-bank\u2014including one by <italic>K\u00f6nigswarter</italic> and Jewish bankers from Amsterdam\u2014were submitted, but the government, advised by <italic>Nederlandsche Bank</italic>, rejected them. Likewise, the government held that state aid for railway construction should only be applied in the most urgent cases. \nAmong the Netherlands\u2019 first industrialists was Samuel Sarphati. Amsterdam born Sarphati wed a Mendes and his sister married a DaCosta. After starting medical oriented institutions, including <italic>Netherlands Society for the Promotion of Pharmacy</italic> in 1842 and <italic>Public Trade School</italic> in 1845, he established <italic>Society for Agriculture & Land Reclamation</italic> in 1848, <italic>Association for Popular Industry</italic> in 1852, <italic>Society for Flour & Bread Factories</italic> in 1856, and <italic>National Mortgage Bank</italic> in 1861. \nSince his brother married Matilda DaCosta\u2014a granddaughter of Meir Pressburger and a first cousin once removed Isaac Goldsmid\u2014Louis Pincoffs entered the Rotterdam municipal council in 1856, advanced to the Provincial States in 1858. Together with his in-law Henry Kerdijk he founded <italic>Kerdijk Pincoffs</italic>, which in 1857 took over a British firm\u2019s assets in the Congo and opened trading posts selling fabrics, earthenware, glass, hardware, arms, and liquor, while exporting palm oil, palm kernels, ground nuts, ivory, rubber, and coffee. While fellow Rotterdam private banker <italic>Mees</italic>\u2014started a century earlier and led by Christians descended from Emperor Charlemagne and related to the Coymans\u2014also set up East African trade, they were not successful.\nIn 1861, the Netherlands passed approved a bill for state railway construction. With the construction of <italic>Nederlandsche Centraal-Spoorweg</italic>, <italic>Cah\u00e9n</italic> Amsterdam\u2019s Josef Cah\u00e9n\u2014a Mendes-in-law and brother of <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic>\u2019s in-law Antwerp banker Joseph Cah\u00e9n\u2014soon became a board member of the in 1862. However, amidst the commodity supply crunch caused by America\u2019s Civil War, the Netherlands ended <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>\u2019s monopoly and legalized Dutch East Indies private trade. However, demise of the Dutch cultivation system prompted a rush of entrepreneurs seeking credit, exacerbating a capital shortage and leading to a severe economic crisis in 1862. \nBy 1863, the Netherlands passed the Bank Act of 1863 while confirming <italic>Nederlandsche Bank</italic>\u2019s monopoly on banknotes. As an alternative supply source to war-torn America, the Netherlands. Since rejecting all bank proposals in 1856, the government authorized all applications in 1863. The first was Sarphati's <italic>Dutch</italic> <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Credit & Deposit</italic>, with capital mostly from French <italic>Comptoir</italic>, including \u00c9douard Hentsch, Louis Bischoffsheim, and Joseph Cah\u00e9n. <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic> also gained a directorship. <italic>Comptoir</italic> hired Cah\u00e9n\u2019s nephew Hermann Wallich that year.\nMeanwhile, Mennonites reinforced banking and trading kinterlinks. While his father had two Clercq grandparents, Jan Eeghen married <italic>Baring</italic> cousin Labouchere by 1850. From that year, in the Dutch Indies, entrepreneurs signed a contract with tin concessionaires on Billiton. By 1856, a Rotterdam merchant house opened a branch in Padang, followed by another in 1857, while <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> and <italic>Javasche Bank</italic> opened agencies outside Java. By 1860, tin miner <italic>Billiton</italic> started in 1860.  \nEntrepreneurs also founded several East Indies-focused banks. Before the Bank Act, limited partnerships did not require registration. Discounting Indies trade bills out of London for Twente textile producers since 1858, the Mennonite Blijdenstein textile banking family established <italic>Twentsche</italic><italic> </italic>in Amsterdam, a credit union that excluded Spanjaard and other Jews, in 1861. After the Bank Act, active investment spurred mixed religious institutions. \nWhile Rotterdam\u2019s <italic>Ezechiels</italic>, <italic>Pincoffs</italic>, and <italic>Mees</italic> supported <italic>Rotterdamsche Bank</italic><italic> </italic>in 1863, Rotterdam businessmen and Twente producers founded <italic>Internationale Credieten</italic>. Likewise, Leo Lippmann\u2019s brother-in-law Alex Mendel and Mennonite merchant Frans Heukelom founded <italic>Neerlandais Bank</italic>. Investors included Jews such as <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>, <italic>Bischoffsheim Hirsch</italic>, <italic>Cah\u00e9n</italic>, <italic>Fould</italic>, and the Pereires, along with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>, and Protestants like <italic>Bunge</italic>, <italic>Staphorst</italic>, <italic>Insinger</italic>, <italic>Goll</italic>, <italic>Wurjhain</italic>, and <italic>Eeghen</italic>. \nWithin a year, <italic>Neerlandais</italic> created <italic>East Indies Trading Bank</italic>, <italic>Indies</italic> RR, and attempted to create a bank in Surinam. After being represented by <italic>Borneo Co</italic> since 1859, <italic>Chartered Bank of India, Australia & China</italic> branched to Batavia in 1863, with <italic>Hope</italic> soon becoming her in Amsterdam correspondent.\nParallel to this, <italic>Pincoffs</italic> and <italic>Mees</italic> co-founded <italic>Nederlandsch-Indische Gas</italic>, <italic>Holland-Amerika Shipping</italic>, and reorganized <italic>Kerdijk Pincoffs</italic> as a limited liability company,<italic> Afrikaansche Handelsvereeniging</italic><italic>,</italic> in 1869. After a <italic>Lissa Kann</italic> in-law married Louis Pincoffs\u2019 niece in 1870, he became the first Jewish member of the First Chamber<italic>.</italic><italic></italic>\nMeanwhile, after Galician Count Jozef Russocki joined the commission to reorg <italic>Galician Mortgage Credit Society </italic>in 1861, his cousin-in-law was Count Seweryn Dunin-Borkowski and their cousin-in-law was Count Wlodzimierz Borkowski. In 1861, the Brody Chamber of Commerce formed a committee led by Dunin-Borkowski to negotiate with <italic>Austrian</italic> RR for rights granted in the 1858 concession. In 1862, <italic>Austrian</italic> RR approved the transfer, and the Ministry of Commerce authorized Borkowski and Mayer Kallir to launch a stock subscription for <italic>Lemberg</italic><italic>-Brody</italic> RR. However, the offering raised only one-fourth of the projected cost. \nLikewise, in Romania, aristocratic politician Petre Sturdza Mavrogheni received a royal railway concession in 1861, from northern Moldova to Galatz with branches to Jassy. In early 1862, he partnered with Prince Leon Sapieha and British contractor Thomas Brassey, affiliated with <italic>Blount Laffitte</italic> since the 1840s. As Brassey sent engineers to evaluate the investment, they concluded costs were underestimated.\nAlong with <italic>Neerlandais</italic>, Langrand formed <italic>Bank of Land & Industry Credit</italic> to develop Austrian agriculture. Since <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> opened provincial branches, Austrian Galicia and attracted banks to extend into Bukovina, where <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> did not branch for another decade. Challenging <italic>Rothschild </italic>Vienna\u2019s dominance in Vienna, President of the Galician Parliament, Radziwill cousin Prince Leon Sapieha, promoted concession and financing of <italic>Lemberg</italic>-<italic>Czernowitz</italic> RR to connect Bukovina to <italic>Moldovan</italic> RR at the Russian border. \nBeating rival <italic>Imperial Privileged Union Bank of Austria</italic>, which had the support of <italic>Metropolitan & Provincial Bank</italic>\u2019s Lord Fermoy, former EIC Deputy-Chair Mangles, <italic>Overend Gurney</italic>, and <italic>Agra Masterman</italic>, Sapieha organized <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> with <italic>Glyn</italic>, <italic>Smyth</italic> cousin Samuel Beaumont, Hungarian Count Edmond Zichy of Vienna, and Vienna\u2019s Chamber of Commerce. Becoming Chair, Saphiea\u2019s director was Karl Mahs Klein, who earlier married the converted noble Amalia Seligmann H\u00f6nig and ran <italic>Stiglitz</italic> Saint-Petersburg and <italic>Danube Shipping</italic>.\nAs  Katz-cousin Victor Offenheim\u2014a relative of Arnstein, Herz, and, further back, Johann and Esther Liebman, Goldschmidt, Gomperz, and Schiff\u2014established<italic> </italic><italic>Lemberg</italic>-<italic>Czernowitz</italic> RR, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> organized <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank</italic> in Prague along with<italic> Lower Austrian Discount </italic><italic>Bank</italic> of Vienna, which also founded <italic>Moravian Discount Bank </italic>in Br\u00fcnn. A mortgage bank started in Prague in 1864 with a focus on sugar, becoming the Empire\u2019s first agricultural credit institute.\nIn 1864, Sapieha and Johann Herz took over the consortium for <italic>Lemberg</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Brody</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Tarnopol</italic> RR. <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, <italic>Pressburger-</italic><italic>Todesco</italic>, Count Borkowski, and other aristocrats joined competing efforts. In 1865, the Sapieha group received the contract, but financial instability drove them to return and seek an alliance with their former rivals. Likewise, Count Russocki joined the board of <italic>Galician Mortgage Credit Society</italic>.  \nBy then, Isaac Pereire, <italic>Sina</italic>, L\u00e4mel- and Rothschild Beyfus-in-law <italic>Haber</italic>, <italic>Mallet</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, and other <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> investors founded <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Boden</italic><italic>c</italic><italic>redit</italic> to acquire estates like<italic> Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic>. Within a year, the latter founded <italic>Wiener</italic> investment bank like <italic>Mobilier</italic>. Along with <italic>TURK </italic>and<italic> Anglo-Austrian</italic>, <italic>Glyn</italic>, London\u2019s largest private bank, promoted one for Italy in 1864 and <italic>London & San Francisco Bank</italic> in 1865 with <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>, <italic>Stern</italic>, <italic>Sulzbach</italic>, and <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen</italic>. (While the founders allowed only allowed ten investors, they later admitted <italic>Russell</italic>.) \nIn 1864, <italic>Agra Masterman </italic>partnered with a <italic>Rodocanachi</italic> cousin to launch <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>General Credit & Finance Co</italic>, to compete with the Anglo-Greek <italic>Egyptian Bank</italic> under British laws, which were less restrictive than those in France, <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> relied on French capital through <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</italic>, <italic>Pastr\u00e9</italic> of Marseilles, and Greek <italic>Sinadino</italic> in Egypt. The collapse of <italic>Agra Masterman </italic>in the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic> led <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> to ally with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic>. \nThe opening of the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> in 1869 spurred new financial links. <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Alexandria transformed into <italic>Austro-Egyptian Bank</italic> in collaboration with <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Franco-Egyptian Bank</italic> in 1870, with funders including Joseph Gunzburg and Paul Haarbleicher, who had married a Rheims, related to the Fould, Aron, and Lazard families.\nMeanwhile, market losses in the fall of 1864, <italic>Neerlandais</italic>\u2019 Mendel fled to America, leaving the bank to absorb large losses and requiring s capital injections from Langrand and the foreign cr\u00e9dit mobilier banks. Langrand proliferated banks as he encountered difficulties. So, when <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> began competing with him and <italic>Mobilier</italic>, Langrand cooperated with Maurice Hirsch for support. And when <italic>Bank of Land & Industry Credit </italic>faced difficulties, he organized <italic>International</italic> <italic>Mortgage</italic> and <italic>Saxon Mortgage Bank</italic> to assist it. And then <italic>General Bank for Developing Agriculture & Public Works</italic>.\n<italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne also used the opportunity to unite Prussian, Saxon, and Polish capital.<italic> </italic>In 1864, an <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne heiress married a nephew of the wife of <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>\u2019s Leo Lippmann. And after an <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne heiress married Polish Saxon banker Frankel Kaskele in 1857, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne instigated the Kaskeles to form Saxon<italic> </italic>central bank <italic>S\u00e4chsische</italic> in Dresden with investment from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, and others in 1865.\nBy 1865, Austria faced a financial crisis with an impending deficit and weak economic conditions. To address this, the Austrian government turned to <italic>Rothschild</italic> and <italic>Baring</italic> for a loan. Negotiations were initially challenging, with the latter declining the loan but expressing willingness to cooperate if Rothschild participated. As negotiations slowly progressed, the suspension of the Austrian constitution weakened Austria\u2019s position. Additionally, Napoleon III\u2019s decision to authorize the subscription of bonds only in Paris hindered <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s attempt to secure advantages. \nDespite these challenges, the loan was eventually authorized, providing Austria with financial means to resist Prussian threats. So, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna, and L\u00e4mel- and Rothschild Beyfus-in-law <italic>Haber</italic> promoted an extension of <italic>Austrian</italic> RR and related rails from Galicia to Croatia and Transylvania, listing shares on the German and British exchanges, with a state profit guarantee. Against the <italic>Treaty of Chaumont</italic>, Bismarck sought to unify the German states. By 1866, Prussia defeated joint Austrian and Bavarian forces. \nWithin a year, Bismarck united North German states, Frankfurt, and other principalities. As Prussian law spread, Frankfurt experienced an economic upswing, marking its transition into an industrial hub, and Jewish emancipation from the ghetto allowed nationwide freedom of movement and citizenship, creating a uniform legal framework for civil equality. This framework extended to southern states by 1871. While Bismarck switched bankers from <italic>Rothschild</italic> to Bleichr\u00f6der, <italic>Prussian Bank</italic>,<italic> Frankfurter Bank</italic>, and other note-issuers continued until fusing into <italic>Reichsbank</italic> (\u201cGRB\u201d) in 1876.\nWhile <italic>Imperial Privileged </italic>yielded to <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, in competition with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, <italic>Lemberg</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Czernowitz</italic> RR suffered during the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>, leading <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> abandoned plans to connect Czernowitz to Odessa. Austria\u2019s defeat in <italic>Austro-Prussian War </italic>led the Emperor to split parliaments with Hungary<italic> </italic>in compromise. To avoid <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> reform, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> funded Ulman\u2019s <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>. Still, the two banks competed until agreeing not to and <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Budapest shuttered in 1871. And as Giuseppe Morpurgo took over insurer <italic>Generali</italic> of Italy following his Parente father-in-law\u2019s death in 1869, his brother became Chair of <italic>Lloyd</italic> Austria.\nAs <italic>Lemberg</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Czernowitz</italic> RR extended further south to Suczawa in Bukovina in 1867, Austria allowed Jews to own land, particularly effecting Bukovina and Galicia. Securing a concession to grow <italic>Austrian</italic> RR from Lemberg to Czernowitz in 1867, Victor Offenheim<italic> </italic>extended the railroad to Brody and Tarnopol in 1869, and by 1872, the Russian border, as well as to Suczawa towards <italic>Moldovan</italic> RR and Jassy in 1870. \nOffenheim also engaged in industry. In 1867, he secured a concession from the Imperial Ministry of Finance to exploit potassium salts that Benedikt Margulies discovered in the Kalusz saline between Lemberg and Suczawa. Galician-born Margulies had been a director of a chemical factory in Trieste and married Anna Lieben Brandeis. A descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and niece of Prague banker Jakob Lieben.   Like his L\u00e4mel K\u00f6nigswarter wife, Prague banker Lieben was a descendant of Chief Rabbi Judah Lowe. \nWhile Jakob Lieben\u2019s daughters married Wertheim K\u00f6nigswarter, Kulp, Speyer, and Kaulla heirs, Jakob\u2019s son married Hamburg banker Wilhelm Speyer Wertheim Hertz\u2019s daughter. Jakob\u2019s brother Ignaz relocated to Vienna and, together with his aunt\u2019s husband\u2014and his third cousin twice removed through descendants of Court Jews Elias Gomperz, Samson Wertheim, and Samuel Oppenheim\u2014Samuel Auspitz, bought and expanded a textile business into banking ventures. Auspitz\u2019s daughter married their cousin Max Auspitz Gomperz, a Moravian wholesale heir who joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s board in 1860. In 1871, Margulies, Offenheim, and Count Alfred Czartoryski Potocki formed the company into a joint-stock, <italic>Kali-Bergbau- und Salinen</italic>, which soon was among the largest chemical enterprises in Lower Austria.\nChartered in 1867, the joint-stock <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic> started to Lemberg and Czernowitz in Bukovina, where <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> branched there in 1863. Her founders were counts Czartoryski, Potocki, Golachowski, and Wlodzimierz Dzieduszycki\u2014whose uncle married a sister of Prince Leon Sapieha\u2019s wife\u2014and Joseph Kolischer, a director of <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> Lemberg and the first Jew to gain citizenship in Lemberg. The following year, Kokischar married the daughter of a Warsaw banker, whose sister was married to Herman Epshteyn\u2019s son, kinterlinking with the <italic>Natanson</italic> of Warsaw and <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent <italic>Lambert</italic>. Overshadowed by <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic>, <italic>Galician Mortgage </italic><italic>Credit Society </italic>promoted Count Jozef Russocki\u2014who married Dzieduszycki\u2019s cousin once removed\u2014to Deputy President.\nMore banks soon started, including <italic>Peasants\u2019 Credit Facility</italic> of Lemberg in 1868. The following year <italic>Bielsko-Bia</italic><italic>l</italic><italic>a Trade </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Industrial Bank</italic> and <italic>Galician Bank for Trade </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Industry</italic> by Galician politicians and landowners as the first short-term credit bank in Galicia and Krakau\u2019s first joint-stock bank, cooperating with <italic>Union </italic><italic>Bank of Vienna</italic> and <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> in Vienna. While some of the founders had already kinterlinked with the Sapieha family, another, a Potocki cousin, did so soon after. Among the Jews involved were legal counsel Arnold Rappaport, a Teomin Frankel Munk descendant whose father been Chief Jurist in Prague. \nAlso in 1869, the <italic>Premissel</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>L</italic><italic>upk</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>w</italic> line took priority to connect to Moravia. Approving the connection in 1871, Hungary granted <italic>Union </italic><italic>Bank of Vienna</italic> a concession. While Austrian sought to secure a <italic>Tarn</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>w-Leluch</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>w</italic> line in 1872, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> and other bankers did not invest. Soon after, Leon Sapieha\u2019s son Adam led the foundation of <italic>Galician Credit Bank</italic> in Lemberg. Likewise, <italic>General Agricultural </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Credit Facility</italic> started in Lemberg for Galicia and Bukovina.\nBy 1869, <italic>Erlanger</italic>, along with <italic>Franco-Austrian Bank</italic>, created <italic>Franco-Hungarian Bank</italic>, which funded Croatian railways, Hungarian shipping, and <italic>First Serbian Bank </italic>with Belgrade merchants. In February 1871, <italic>Erlanger</italic>, <italic>Franco-Austrian Bank</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, and <italic>Union Bank of Vienna</italic> established <italic>Aust</italic><italic>ro</italic><italic>-German Bank</italic> in Frankfurt, with Raphael Erlanger as Chair. <italic>Erlanger</italic> also founded <italic>Hungarian </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic> in 1871 and <italic>Hungarian </italic><italic>Municipal Credit </italic>in 1872. Also in 1871, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic><italic> </italic>and three small banks founded <italic>Austrian General Bank</italic>, with Karl L\u00e4mel Mauthner as the first Managing Procurator. A descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, a nephew of a Porges, and a cousin-in-law of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Director Carl Wei\u00df, Mauthner\u2019s brother Gustav joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> in 1869. Gustav soon joined Karl at <italic>Austrian General Bank</italic>.\nSince Katz-cousin Kallir of Brody founded Galicia\u2019s largest private bank, <italic>Kallir</italic>, the sharp decline of the city following reforms after the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, led the family to shift activities to Vienna, and partner with<italic> </italic>Landau cousin <italic>Nathansohn</italic>. Meanwhile, Kallir\u2019s Katz-descendant Horowitz cousin started Lemberg\u2019s second largest bank with his Katz-descendant Ashkenasy wife, a cousin of the Chief Rabbi of British Ashkenazi Hirschel Levi and in-law of <italic>Rafalovich</italic> and <italic>Ephrussi</italic>, Odessa\u2019s grain traders. With connections to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna, <italic>Horowitz</italic> directed resources on their behalf in Galicia. \nAfter Abraham Schreiner of Boryslaw in Austrian Galicia innovated naphtha production in 1853, Isaac Landesberg established a factory in Lemberg by 1862 to produce candles and soap. By 1862, Galician law preserved landowner\u2019s right to oil, allowing them to establish mines and transfer mineral rights while retaining a share of profits. As Robert Doms produced wax across 22 factories around Boryslaw, Isaac Landesberg produced paraffin and received an imperial monopoly. However, challenges arose as the government assumed mineral rights over oil in 1869. Unlike Brody, Lemberg, or other locales where academic Katz rabbis led the Haskalah, inter-married merchants did so around Boryslaw to keep the status quo with the Hasidism.\nGalician refineries quickly grew after Schreiner innovated naphtha production in 1853. As refined oil lit trains and hospitals in Lemberg by 1855, demand for a mineral wax to manufacture candles grew. Small refineries, such as <italic>Liebermann</italic>, <italic>Mermelstein</italic>, and <italic>Schutzmann</italic>, were established in Boryslaw, while <italic>Gartenberg</italic> grew large by intermarrying with <italic>Liebermann</italic>, <italic>Schreiner</italic>, and other families. In France, Alexandre Deutsch-Meurthe, a Lorraine Jew, began refining vegetable oil near Paris in 1843. But as America began exporting petroleum, French Christian <italic>Desmarais</italic> started a refinery by 1861 and Deutsch-Meurthe followed. \nWhile Jews had been in Britain since 1655, they remained second-class citizens. Barred from <italic>Oxford</italic> and <italic>Cambridge</italic>, Jews trained the secular <italic>University of London</italic>. However, the main obstacle for Jewish aspiring barristers was the Christian oath originating from the anti-Roman Catholic test. In 1833, Francis Goldsmid petitioned to be sworn in using a Hebrew Bible, becoming the first professing Jew to gain entry. His success opened doors for other Jewish barristers, but the representation of Jews in the legal profession did not grow proportionally due to various factors. Jewish barristers faced challenges in reaching high positions in the English government and civil service but found more success outside Britain. \nIndeed, in Austria, 26 Jewish families were ennobled prior to 1848, and another 161 between 1849 and 1884. While Jews continued to leave Bohemia, Hungary had particularly high Jewish ennoblements as migrants from Galicia moved into Hungary, the first half of the century, and Austria after. Since <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna intervened for Austria to grant permission for Frankfurt cousins to migrate in 1823, the Emperor ennobled cousin and in-law partners Moritz Goldschmidt, Leo Wertheim, Anton Schnapper, and Friedrich Landauer Schey in the early 1860s. By the end of the decade, their fellow <italic>Austrian</italic><italic> </italic>RR executive Alex Kallir of Galicia was ennobled.\nOnly a few Jewish families were ennobled in Prussia. In 1867, Abraham Oppenheim of Cologne was granted a patent of nobility in Prussia. Berlin banker Gerson Bleichr\u00f6der was ennobled in 1872. Maximilian Goldschmidt Rothschild of Frankfurt became a baron in 1907. Rudolf Mosse, Moritz Plaut, Rudolph Sulzbach, and Moritz and Max Warburg declined offers. Russia ennobled few unconverted Jews. While Horace Gunzburg received a barony from Grand Duke Louis III of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1872 for his financial services, Alex II granted special permission for Gunzburg to be able to use the title in Russia several years later.\nSince German Jews Salis Schwabe and Lewis Heymann migrated to Britain in the 1830s, the former established a calico-printing factory in Manchester, which by 1840 became the second largest in the industry, while the latter expanded the lace trade, with Nottingham\u2019s products surpassing those of France by 1862. Heymann\u2019s contributions were significant enough to earn him the distinction of becoming Nottingham\u2019s first foreign-born mayor in 1857. However, both Schwabe and Heymann embraced Unitarianism as an avenue for integration, exemplifying the prevalence of apostasy among wealthy German Jewish immigrants in British manufacturing cities, a trend markedly different from the situation in London during the 19th century.\nIn London, after <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s<italic> </italic>Nathan Rothschild died, his daughter scandalously married a Christian aristocrat in the 1839, and their daughter wed a Coutts by 1865. After Jews were declared eligible for municipal offices in 1845, Britain elected Lionel Rothschild as the first Jewish Member of Parliament in 1847. However, as a practicing Jew, he was not allowed to take the seat until 1858. He later became Britain\u2019s first ennobled Jewish peer in 1885. \nAfter Katz-Samuel descendant Benjamin Phillips served as Mayor of London for a year from 1865, Lionel Rothschild\u2019s son, Nathaniel, became the first (and last) time Rothschild to join BOE\u2019s court in 1868. While the converted Abrabanel, Mendes, and Bassevi cousin Benjamin Disraeli became Britain\u2019s first Jewish PM that year by appealing to his noble roots, Catholics\u2014who made up 20% of the population\u2014had to wait another 150 years.\nIn France, on the other hand, Catholic industrialists, bankers, and other bourgeoisie dominated provincial elective offices. Aside from the converted Pereire and Fould<italic> </italic>of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 Alphonse Rothschild was the only Jewish conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9raux elected in 1870 among the Catholic aristocratic cousinhood of Duke LaRochefoucauld-Doudeauville, Marquis Talhouet, Baron Graffenried, Marquis Vogue, Marquis Chasseloup-Laubat, Prince Beauvau, and countless others.\nAlong with the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>, the death of Basile Parent shook French industry as <italic>Parent Schaken</italic> dissolved and her gas PUs underwent a period of unstable transformation. Within months, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier </italic>suspended payments and investors forced out the Pereires. Since Napoleon III sought free public limited liability companies in 1861, several banks, including <italic>Bank of Paris</italic>, formed before the law came into being in 1867. \nAs the daughter of Bischoffsheim\u2019s cousin Germain Cassel of Brussels with his Stern wife wed a Speyer in 1866, <italic>Bischoffsheim Hirsch</italic>\u2019s employee Raphael Bauer married the daughter of <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent, <italic>Lambert</italic>, by 1867. With this kinterlink and the death of head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris James Rothschild in 1868, Maurice Hirsch left Brussels to operate out of <italic>Goldschmidt</italic> Paris. \nA year before Paris banker Leo Javal's niece\u2014a cousin of the Eichthal and <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> affiliated L\u00e4mels\u2014married Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s great grandson, a Rothschild cousin, Hirsch\u2019s brother married a daughter of Moritz Ladenburg (and his Goldschmidt cousin) and co-founded <italic>Bayerische Vereinsbank</italic> in 1868 with <italic>Eichthal</italic>, <italic>Wilmersodoerffer</italic>, and <italic>Guggenheimayer</italic>. \nLike <italic>Wilmersodoerffer</italic>, nephew of Munich private banker <italic>Oberndoerffer</italic>\u2014a cousin-in-law of descendants of Katz, Samson Wertheim, and Samuel Oppenheim\u2014Munich banker <italic>Guggenheima</italic><italic>ye</italic><italic>r</italic> had kinterlinked with a Porges descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe in Prague, Kaulla, and Court Jew descended <italic>Wassermann</italic> banking family. <italic>Ladenburg</italic> started in 1785 as jewelers in Mannheim and wed a Frankfurt Goldschmidt after the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> and then with Hamburg cloth and chemical merchant Beit. \nWhile Ladenburg kinterlinked with Manchester cloth trader Jacob Behrens\u2014whom <italic>Rothschild</italic> soon retained\u2014Caroline Beit married a Warburg in 1842 and her brother Ferdinand worked as a chemical director at <italic>Elbe Copper Works</italic> and married Moritz\u2019s Goldschmidt Ladenburg cousin in 1850. <italic>Ladenburg</italic> co-founded what became chemical producer BASF in 1865, Beit expanded his family refinery into <italic>Norddeutsche Affinerie</italic> and became a director of <italic>Norddeutsche Bank</italic>. \nFerdinand\u2019s brother Phillip continued the family cloth trade in Hamburg and married the daughter of Hessian Court Jew David Feidel. While Phillip\u2019s son expanded into dyes, his grandson Alfred later moved to London to start <italic>Beit</italic> to bank the diamond trade. Like his sister earlier, Selig Ladenburg\u2019s son Ferdinand also kinterlinked with Hamburg, marrying Nathan Speyer Nathan in 1862.\nJoining <italic>Hohenemser</italic> in 1820, Joseph Ladenburg Hohenemser wed his daughter to Jacob Behrens in 1844. Joseph and his cousin and brother-in-law Selig were instrumental in Mannheim\u2019s development. After Baden joined the Prussian-German Customs Union in 1835, they co-founded <italic>Mannheim Products & Securities Exchange</italic> in 1862 and <italic>Central Baden Bank</italic> in 1870. That year, <italic>Ladenburg </italic>co-founded <italic>Rheinische Credit</italic>, whose customers included Rhenish automobile and engine factory<italic> Benz</italic>, a competitor of <italic>Daimler Motoren </italic>of Stuttgart.\nLikewise, <italic>Ladenburg</italic> branched to London and Frankfurt. Selig\u2019s son Emil married the daughter of a Halphen and Frankfurt banker Maurice Flersheim and established <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Frankfurt in 1852. Over the following decades, he later played pivotal roles in the Frankfurt Bank Commission and Germany\u2019s central bank <italic>Reichsbank</italic> and as Chair of <italic>Frankfurt Stock Exchange</italic>. Ladenburg was associated with composer Johannes Brahms through Selig Ladenburg\u2019s great nephew, Wilhelm Levi who joined <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Mannheim in 1868. Born to a Hessian regional rabbi Benedict Levi, a stepson of Katz-descendant Rabbi Asher Low of Wallerstein and Karlsruhe. Wilhelm converted to Catholicism and changed his name to Lindeck upon marrying a Catholic woman. Among his clients was composer Johannes Brahms.\nIn late 1863, Ghica-in-law Constantin Su\u021bu, representing, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>, submitted a competing proposal with minor differences. Evaluating the proposals, Ion Ghica\u2019s commission submitted two reports without a recommendation. Mavrogheni and Su\u021bu merged their projects, and Romania approved the unified concession. Politicians opposed the plan, citing lack of competition. As Mavrogheni\u2019s demanded to raise per-kilometer costs, the Council transferred the concession to the Su\u021bu syndicate around 1865. \nWhile the future architect of Tsar Nicholas I\u2019s Jewish policy, Romanian Count Pavel Kiselev, implemented anti-Jewish legislation in Romania in 1831, Jewish bankers remained a main source of government and private credit without modern long-term credit institutions. By 1864, Dominator of Romania Alexandru Cuza introduced limited political participation for certain Jews and naturalization of certain foreign Jews, appointing a Jewish inspector of finances. \nStill, Jews continued to industrialize Romania. Since Wallachian trader Marmorosch\u2019s brother-in-law Isaak L\u00f6bel left to represent <italic>Azienda Assicuratrice</italic> of Trieste\u2019s new Bucharest branch in 1857. From 1861, <italic>Azienda </italic>added Galatz banker Isaac Rottenberg as a director. Since marrying Alex Byk\u2019s second cousin, Rottenberg\u2019s daughter married Jacques Rubenstein, who started a bank in Galatz in 1864. The same year, <italic>Neuschotz</italic>, <italic>Byk</italic>, and three merchants purchased a steam mill in Jassy.\nFrom 1863, Isaak L\u00f6bel\u2019s father Jacob lobbied for a <italic>TURK</italic> branch in Bucharest. A year after land reform in 1864, L\u00f6bel, with Marmorosch, <italic>Camondo</italic>\u2019s in-law <italic>Halfon</italic>, Adolf Hertz, and Prince Ion Ghica co-founded <italic>Romania Bank</italic> as a branch of <italic>TURK</italic>. The same year, Moses Vecsler\u2014whose children kinterlinked with a nephew of <italic>Creditanstalt </italic>Lemberg\u2019s Abraham Mises and a Rappaport Ornstein descendant of Zevi Ashkenasy after the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>\u2014registered bank with the Austrian Consulate in Jassy.\nWhile Jews fled Russian Ukraine for Turkish Romania in 1865, pro-Jewish reforms frustrated Romanian landowning nobles. When a scandal forced Dominator Cuza to abdicate in 1866, uncertainty continued for months until a cousin of the Prussian ruling family, Prince Karol Hohenzollern, was elected. Amidst the political crisis, the railroad project was canceled and Romanian noble and PM Ion Bratianu expelled Jews from villages, supervising the process in Jassy. \nDespite protests from local landowners and diplomatic interventions from Prince Karol, Napoleon III, and ambassadors from Britain and Austria, Romania continued to discriminate. Amid financial difficulties that year, Moldovan banker Israel Daniel mortgaging his entire fortune, a credit line from <italic>Rothschild</italic> enabled him to establish a bank in Leipzig and execute payments. Within a year, currency reform allowed <italic>Daniel</italic> to transform into a bank. As Marmorosch\u2019s father-in-law Jacob L\u00f6bel died in 1867, the Marmorosch family kinterlinked with a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe related of the Oppenheim, L\u00e4mel, Goldsmid, Porges, and Pressburger families, and immigrated from Bucharest to Vienna as <italic>Marmorosch </italic>continued to finance Romania\u2019s government, public utilities, and trade.\nInstead of relying on Jewish bankers, Ottoman Bulgaria only had private bankers, usually connected to trade and family. Atanas Burov, born to a prosperous Bulgarian Orthodox trader in rural north central Lyaskovets, Bulgaria, continued the trade of his father. In 1825, Atanas married Stana Mikhailovski. Stana\u2019s Cossack and Greek trader ancestors settled in Bulgaria after supplying the Turkish army during the <italic>Turkish-Austrian War</italic> that ended with Turkish defeat in 1683. The Mikhailovski family went on to include merchants in Elena and Bishop Ilarion Makariopolski, who was instrumental in the fight for an independent Bulgarian Orthodox Church. By 1862, the sons of Atanas and Stana founded <italic>Burov</italic> to lend and trade commodities such as fur, cattle, cocoons, groceries, hardware, and farm equipment. Burov soon kinterlinked with <italic>Geshov</italic>.\nOriginating from Karlovo, Evstati Geshov and his brother expanded their father\u2019s trading firm to Wallachia and Moldova. By 1834, they had established <italic>Geshov</italic> Plovdiv, and the following year, <italic>Geshov</italic> Vienna where he managed the trade of Bulgarian raw materials and imported manufactured goods from Austria. <italic>Geshov</italic> Constantinople formed in 1847 and <italic>Geshov</italic> Manchester followed in 1865. Having moved to Manchester with his family to oversee this operation, <italic>Geshov</italic> facilitated the exchange of Bulgarian grain and perfume with British manufactured products and traded with Bulgarian merchants such his brothers in Plovdiv and Constantinople, <italic>Robev</italic> of Ohrid and <italic>Puliev Georgiev </italic>of Wallachia.  \nEstablished in 1839 by Teodor Puliev in Moldovan Galatz and Braila on the border of Wallachia, Moldova, and Bessarabia near Odessa, <italic>Puliev Georgiev </italic>first traded agricultural goods and textiles. Hristo Puliev expanded operations to Karlovo, Plovdiv, and Pazardzhik until his death in 1850, after which Nikola extended their network across Bulgaria. Operating since 1785, <italic>Georgiev </italic>imported tobacco and other goods from Izmir and Constantinople in the 1840s, expanding to Odessa, France, Britain, Genoa, and Livorno after the <italic>Crimean War</italic>. They diversified into banking and Romanian farming, cultivating a network of over 400 merchants and producers along the Danube, with only a few Jews.\nIn the early 1870s, branched to Bulgaria starting with Plovdiv on the Maritsa River in the south. Despite naturalizing as a British subject in 1872, Evstati Geshov faced stiff competition from established British firms and returned to Plovdiv that year.  Soon after, <italic>TURK</italic> Adrianople formed, where the Anglo-Greek <italic>Ralli Skilitzi</italic> partnership dominated border trade.\nLike in China, geo-political opposition from Russia hindered British HSBC expansion into Persia. Since 1866, <italic>Erlanger</italic> Paris attempted to secure Persia\u2019s first concession for a Western bank in Tehran. When Sassoon fled Baghdad before investing HSBC, Persian Jews fled persecution in the late 1830s into Central Asia from the Emirates of Bukhara and Samarkand. By the 1860s, Russia\u2019s conquest of the region disrupted the nomadic economy and tribal politics, as well as intermittent resistance from the Kazakhs, who acted independently and aligned with either the southern khanates or Russia. The area encompassed the sparsely populated steppe of Turkic and the Khanates of Khiva, Bukhara, and Kokkand, while settled urban cultures thrived among the Volga Tatars and Central Asian oases. \nIn 1866, the Russia Military banned Kazaks from admission even if they were already cadets. While Bukharan Jews depended on Muslim intermediaries for trade with Russia, Tsar Alex II granted Russian citizenship to select Bukharan Jews in 1866 for six years as Russia absorbed the lands as protectorates allowing semi-independence for the Emirs. Bukhara soon attracted Jews persecuted in the old Silk Road cities of Mashhad, Persia, and Herat, of British-influenced Afghanistan.\nAs Turkey\u2019s new government gave Langrand a concession to link Constantinople with <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s <italic>Austrian</italic> RR at Croatia (\u201c<italic>ORIENT</italic>\u201d). Likewise, Bethel Strussberg, a descendent of Prussian Polish Lords\u2019 Jews who moved to Britain and converted, promoted Romanian railways with <italic>Berliner</italic>, <italic>Norddeutsche</italic>, and other banks. \nAmong Maurice Hirsch\u2019s investments included <italic>Moscow-Ryazan RR</italic> as Russia industrialized after the <italic>Crimean War</italic>. After supplying this railroad in 1866, <italic>Polyakov </italic>got their big break extending <italic>Ryazan </italic>RR in 1867. While one Polyakov brother moved to Taganrog to work on <italic>Kursk-Kharkov-Azov</italic> RR, another relocated to Kharkov. While Russia\u2019s funded the once <italic>Mobilier</italic>-affiliated railway from Moscow to Saint-Peterburg in 1868, <italic>Polyakov</italic> linked Moscow to Ukrainian Donetsk. \nAs Russia guaranteed railway construction for <italic>Saint-Petersburg-Odessa</italic> RR in 1867,<italic> Ephrussi</italic> and <italic>Rafalovich</italic> raised funds for the Charkow-Krementschug section in London through their grain consignment merchant, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and in Berlin through <italic>Disconto</italic>. Since Rafalovich marry-partnered with the Moldovan-Ukrainian border trader, Katz-descendant Moisey Ashkenasy moved to Odessa to export grain in the early 1860s\u2014soon dominating the trade with <italic>Rafalovich</italic> and <italic>Ephrussi</italic>\u2014and began banking as <italic>Ashkenasy </italic>from 1868. \nThe same year, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> joined<italic> Rothschild </italic>Frankfurt and Paris in funding a Russian land bank as <italic>Rapha\u00ebl</italic> floated Russian bonds. Likewise, hereditary serfs descendants solidified as dynastic banker. While Old Believer Savva\u2019s son Timofei Morozov chaired <italic>Moscow Stock Exchange Committee</italic> and headed <italic>Moscow Merchant</italic> from 1868, Grigori Eliseev of <italic>Eliseev</italic> became Commercial Counsellor and <italic>Council of State Credit Institutions</italic> member in 1869, soon becoming State Counsellor and Chair of <italic>Saint-Petersburg Stock Exchange</italic>. \nLikewise, <italic>Schepeler</italic> Riga received a contract to issue bonds for <italic>Shuisko-Ivanovskaya</italic> RR and collaborated with <italic>Sulzbach</italic> of Frankfurt to obtain a concession for <italic>Moscow-Smolensk</italic> RR. However, before they used the concession, <italic>Schepeler</italic> New York failed in the <italic>Panic of 1869</italic>.  Although the <italic>Saint-Petersburg Stock Exchange</italic> continued to boom, a sudden loan rate crashed stocks there and in Moscow by October. While Moldovan <italic>Cahane</italic> fell into bankruptcy that year, <italic>Vecsler</italic> kinterlinked with <italic>Daniel</italic>, <italic>Byk</italic> in-law Ornstein, and Waldberg\u2019s brother-in-law Cahane, and his son settled in Vienna. Likewise, the <italic>Manoach</italic>, <italic>Camondo</italic>, and <italic>Halfon</italic> Romanian banking families reinforced kinterlinks.\nAs Napoleon III expanded free<italic> </italic>trade, coal import inflation drove him to seize the Prussian Ruhr in 1870. However, as he lost the <italic>Franco-Prussian War,</italic> ending Napoleon\u2019s reign and <italic>Second French Empire</italic> a year later. After the <italic>Treaty of Frankfurt</italic> of 1871 annexed part of Lorraine to Germany, Alphonse Fould and Mayer Dupont sold the Ars factories to maintain French citizenship and relocated to Nancy in 1873. They initially worked on the Montet concession before shifting to the Ludm concession, which supplied the Pompey blast furnaces, constructed in 1874. While marrying Auguste Dupont\u2019s granddaughter Fortun\u00e9e, Fould pushed Lorraine into metallurgy and took an increasing role in his father-in-law\u2019s <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic>, becoming <italic>Dupont Fould</italic>. \nThe fall of Napoleon III and the Second Empire in 1870 led to the rise of L\u00e9on Gambetta. While Gambetta\u2019s father was an Italian grocer from Celle-Ligure, his mother was a Frenchwoman. Gambetta acquired French nationality in 1859 and moved to Paris to study law. Seeking to replace the old elite, he allowed more Jews to enter state positions. Unlike Central and East European Jewry, French Jews did not convert to Christianity for career advancement but retained their identity and leadership in Jewish organizations, harmonizing Jewish identity with republican values. Like Court Jews, dynastic State Jews kinterlinked to ensure continuity.\nSince 1791, Jews in France gained citizenship and access to academic roles but waited decades for influential roles. After the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, Napoleon III seized power and appointed the first Jews to the cabinet, with Michel Silny\u2014Isaac Orchel\u2019s grandson, Paris banker, and a leader of the <italic>Revolution of 1830</italic>\u2014as Minister of Finance and Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux as Minister of Justice. Gustave Bedarrides was appointed Avocat General in 1848, and later a high-ranking judicial official. His brother, a banker, faced financial difficulties, but Bedarrides\u2019 own career remained distinguished despite challenges. Emmanuel Cain \u201cLamb\u00e9rt\u201d became the first Jewish prefect during the Second Empire in 1858, after abandoning his Cain surname. \nIn the 1820s, Jacob Alphand\u00e9ry was among the most heavily taxed Jews in Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, outside of Marseilles. His relative David married a Bedarrides and became a banker and President of <italic>Caisse d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>\u00c9pargne de Salon</italic>. With recommendations from his cousin Gustave Bedarrides, Fernand served as Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral at the Cour d\u2019Appel in Bordeaux and later as Conseiller at the Cour de Cassation. As Fernand married No\u00e9mie Rothschild in 1870, Daniel Alphand\u00e9ry married Blanche Rodrigues in 1870. The same year, David\u2019s son Albert became a Judge in Chaumont and later became Examining Magistrate. Another Alphand\u00e9ry cousin, Joseph Cr\u00e9mieux served as a Director at <italic>Banque Populaire de Nice</italic> after Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux returned to Parliament in 1869 and served as Minister of Justice and Government of National Defense in 1870.  \nSince 1830, Jewish private banking enjoyed its golden age in Paris and around Europe. However, a pivotal transformation unfolded after the <italic>Franco-Prussian War</italic>. As investment banks and large deposit banks emerged and operated as public limited companies, private banking establishments declined in influence and dominance. This change marked a departure from the traditional model of dynastic private banks and a diversification of professional roles within the banking industry.\nFollowing French invasion of Prussia in 1870, Edward Blount dissolved <italic>Blount Laffitte</italic> and transferred it to <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, of which he became President. When France negotiated an indemnity to Germany, French representatives included <italic>Lyonnais</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic>Germain and Alfred Andre, while <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> represented Prussia. Due to the financial crisis in France, BDF suspended convertibility and curtail foreign debt payments by domestic firms. \nWhile Huguenot banker <italic>Andre</italic> negotiated the indemnity was Regent of BDF and director of <italic>TURK</italic> and other railways and banks by this time, <italic>Andre</italic> placed more government debt after. Having started <italic>Lyonnais </italic>London to safeguard assets in 1870, Germain incorporated <italic>Lyonnais</italic> to grow commercial credit soon after. And in 1870, Hottinguer kinterlinked with Bethmann, a cousin of Protestant bankers <italic>Metzler</italic>, <italic>Borski</italic>, <italic>Cazenove</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Hope</italic>\u2019s Labouchere, and<italic> </italic><italic>Steiger</italic>, the former <italic>Beyfus</italic> of Frankfurt.\nIn 1870, before the <italic>Franco-Prussian War</italic>, German banks established Berlin-based <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> to finance foreign trade. Founders including <italic>Delbr\u00fcck</italic>, <italic>Schickler</italic>, and <italic>Berliner</italic><italic> </italic>heir Victor Frankel Magnus<italic> </italic>of Berlin, <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, <italic>Deichmann</italic>, and<italic> Rath </italic>of Cologne, <italic>Schlesische </italic>of Breslau, <italic>Heydt</italic> of Elberfeld (related to the Engels, Styn, and Kamp families), <italic>Sulzbach</italic> of Frankfurt (kinterlinking with Goldschmidt Weisweiller that year), and Kaulla\u2019s <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic> of Stuttgart. \nThe primary promoters were Ludwig Bamberger\u2014Louis Bischoffsheim\u2019s nephew, married to August Belmont\u2019s cousin, and Maurice Hirsch\u2019s brother-in-law\u2014and Protestant Adalbert Delbr\u00fcck, a friend of <italic>Deichmann</italic>, who married <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>-kinterlinked <italic>Warschauer</italic>\u2019s niece-in-law and was the brother of the President of Bismarck\u2019s Chancellery. However, the first head, Georg Siemens\u2014<italic>Siemens</italic>\u2019 second cousin\u2014increasingly sidelined Delbr\u00fcck.\nSince Hermann Marcuse became<italic> </italic><italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>\u2019s New York agent with <italic>Deichmann</italic><italic> </italic>as a limited partner, he retired from active banking and <italic>Baltzer Tacks </italic>replaced his <italic>Marcuse Baltzer</italic><italic> </italic>in 1865. By 1870, Marcuse co-founded and, two years later, positioned his nephew Paul Lichtenstein, who had emigrated to America from Frankfurt in 1866, as the bank\u2019s New York agent. That year, Lichtenstein married the Protestant daughter of Friedrich Kapp, New York\u2019s Commissioner of Immigration and member of <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Board alongside Marcuse. <italic>Lichtenstein </italic>soon invested in petroleum and other American ventures. \nAmidst the <italic>Franco-Prussian War of 1870</italic>, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic><italic> </italic>shuttered her Paris branch. She quickly expanded with international partnership branches, including <italic>Dutschka</italic> in Vienna<italic>,</italic> <italic>Amsterdam Bank</italic> in Amsterdam, <italic>Arnhold</italic> <italic>Henrich</italic> in Halle, and others before re-forming a Paris agency in 1873. Representing <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> in Bavaria, Theodor Cramer-Klett\u2014a Lutheran owner of engine producer <italic>Maschinenfabrik</italic> <italic>Augsburg N\u00fcrnberg</italic> (\u201cMAN\u201d)\u2014founded <italic>Merck</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Christian</italic> in Munich with Hermann Merck in 1870. \nJoining <italic>Merck</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Christian</italic>, Wilhelm Finck\u2014 a son and grandson of prominent Catholic Bavarian judges\u2014became partner within a year. Cramer-Klett, Merck, and<italic> </italic><italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> created <italic>South German Mortgage Bank</italic>, breaking the monopoly of <italic>Bavarian Mortgage & Exchange Bank </italic>from 1835. Cramer-Klett also participated in<italic> </italic><italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> agencies <italic>Lotz Betcke</italic> in Kassel and <italic>Scheibius</italic> in Milan.\nAs a Bischoffsheim Cah\u00e9n married a Morpurgo, <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> and <italic>Cah\u00e9n </italic>joined the big Swiss banks to fund <italic>Banca Generale</italic>, to be chaired by<italic> Morpurgo</italic> of Trieste, <italic>Pisa</italic> and <italic>Schott Weill </italic>of Milan and Florence, Morpurgo in-law <italic>Weil Weiss</italic> of Turin, and several regional Italian bankers in 1871. (However, most Catholic nobles did not invest in banks or industry. After Jew Ignazio Weil Weiss was ennobled in 1870 and his daughter married into nobility, he became one of few nobles to invest in several banks.) \nSince 1866,<italic> Bank of Belgium</italic>, affiliated with <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>, <italic>Oppenh</italic><italic>y</italic><italic>m</italic><italic> Alberti</italic>, and <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels, financed Belgian textile heir Simon Philippart\u2019s <italic>Co des Chemins de fer des Bassins Houillers du Hainaut</italic>. Controlling 19 regional railways by 1870, Philippart expanded into France and Luxembourg, acquiring <italic>Lille-Valenciennes</italic> RR and <italic>Orl\u00e9ans-Rouen</italic> RR. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> London raised \u00a3100 hundred million for French reparations, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels, along with in-laws <italic>Errera</italic> and <italic>May</italic>, and extended cousins Sulzbach, \u00c9mile Ladenburg, and Philippe Speyer of Frankfurt, and Samuel Montague of London to start <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>. \n<italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>\u2019 board was primarily Protestant. Unlike other Belgian bank and company boards, there were several German administrators over years, including <italic>Stern</italic> heirs. Like <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels\u2019 Joseph Oppenheim was connected to <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Belgium</italic> through this brother Adolphe and <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> Brussels co-founded <italic>Belgian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> continued those relationships with Ernest Urban, an administrator of <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> from 1875 to 1877. His brother Jules directed <italic>Grand Central Belgian Railways</italic> from 1864. Their sister married a daughter of Fran\u00e7ois Anspach. The son of a Huguenot pastor of Geneva, Fran\u00e7ois was a director of <italic>Bank of Belgium</italic> and represented Brussels in the Chamber of Representatives in 1830. Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 son Eug\u00e8ne\u00a0 became Governor of <italic>Belgian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>. \nTo work with <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, <italic>Errera</italic> also helped found private banker <italic>Philippson Horowitz</italic>in. Franz Philippson\u2014a son of the Rabbi of Magdeburg, descendant of a Chief Rabbi of Krakau, and a cousin of Katz and Landau\u2014Philippson moved to Brussels to clerk with <italic>Errera</italic> in 1865 and became his right-hand man. Along with his cousin and Errera, he formed <italic>Philippson Horowitz </italic>in 1871, and wed a Goudchaux Halphen in-law.\nHowever, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> restructured in 1871 due to legal issues and significant stock declines since the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic> forced out <italic>Pereire</italic>. The bank, previously led by <italic>Pereire</italic>, was reorganized with old shareholders diluted 2 to 1. While <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> sold <italic>Mobilier</italic> shares to <italic>Banque de Paris</italic>, <italic>Pereire</italic> bought shares from <italic>Mallet</italic>, <italic>Schneider</italic>, and others to consolidate positions. Although cousins of Huguenots and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris dominated French railroad boards, several Pereire directors continued into the 1930s. But they lost their power.\nAt the same time and for the same reasons, another multi-national banking giant formed. Since Samuel Sarphati died in 1866, his <italic>Comptoir</italic> and <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic>-funded<italic> </italic><italic>Dutch</italic> <italic>Bank of Credit & Deposit</italic><italic> </italic>faced declining operations in the Netherlands and moved her headquarters to Belgium and France in 1868. After absorbing <italic>Bischoffsheim Hirsch</italic> of Brussels,<italic> </italic><italic>Du</italic><italic>t</italic><italic>ch</italic> <italic>Bank of Credit & Deposit</italic> fused with <italic>Bank of Paris</italic> into <italic>Bank of Paris & Netherlands </italic>(\u201c<italic>Paribas</italic>\u201d) with financing from <italic>Go\u00fcin</italic><italic> </italic>of Tours, <italic>Fould</italic>, <italic>Schnapper</italic>, and <italic>Stern</italic> of Paris, <italic>Brugmann</italic> of Brussels, and <italic>Tietgen</italic> of Copenhagen. Raphael Bischoffsheim\u2019s sons-in-law Joseph Cah\u00e9n and Ludwig Bamberger left the boards of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>and <italic>Deutsche</italic>, respectively,<italic> </italic>to join <italic>Paribas</italic>. \n<italic>Paribas</italic> also purchased Huguenot Dutch-American <italic>Boissevain</italic> with Mijnhard Boissevain leading <italic>Paribas</italic> Amsterdam. (Since Cah\u00e9n\u2019s brother married Elisabeth Mendes in 1838 and opened <italic>Cah\u00e9n</italic> Amsterdam, Mendes\u2019 grandniece married Boissevain\u2019s cousin-once-removed Jan Pierson in 1880.) To lead <italic>Paribas</italic> Brussels, <italic>Paribas</italic> appointed Raphael Bauer, son-in-law of <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent, <italic>Lambert</italic>. That year, <italic>Biedermann</italic> of Vienna\u2014having kinterlinked with <italic>Bischoffsheim </italic>in 1856\u2014married London banker Joseph Ellissen Stern, a cousin of the Frankfurt and Paris bankers. As <italic>Paribas</italic> acquired interests in <italic>Parent Schaken</italic>\u2019s gas plants and railroads, she joined <italic>Bischoffsheim </italic>to found <italic>Banca Napoletana</italic> by 1871.\nLikewise, since Hirsch\u2019s family kinterlinked with <italic>W\u00fcrttemberg Court Bank</italic>\u2019s Kaulla family in the 1820s, <italic>Pflaum </italic>helped expand Kaulla\u2019s influence into Germany and Austria. After his cousin married a Katz descendant and merchant father founded a bank in Stuttgart in 1855, Alex Pflaum worked at <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, and then in banks in Berlin and Brussels. In 1860, he joined <italic>Pflaum</italic> and became a limited partner a year after marrying a <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> cousin. He also financed railroads in Austria from 1868 and contributed to the growth of industrial companies in W\u00fcrttemberg. He was instrumental in the founding of <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic> (1869) and <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Notenbank</italic> (1871). \nAlong with opening a Paris branch to fund France, <italic>Rapha\u00ebl</italic> floated bonds for Hungary and Turkey. As <italic>Deutsche</italic> branched into London, <italic>Erlanger</italic> also branched from Paris and Frankfurt to London in 1870, and <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, <italic>Frankfurter</italic>, <italic>Wiener</italic>, <italic>Sulzbach</italic>, <italic>Eltzbacher</italic>, <italic>Rotterdamsche</italic>, <italic>Lippmann Rosentha</italic><italic>l</italic>, <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic>, and <italic>Becker Fuld</italic> co-founded <italic>Amsterdam Bank</italic> to control the diamond credit market.\nAlso in 1870, Christian Hamburg merchant Theodor Wille led <italic>Goldschmidt</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>K\u00f6nigswarter</italic> Hamburg, <italic>Warburg</italic>; <italic>Hesse Delbanco</italic>, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Woermann</italic>, and<italic> </italic><italic>Berenberg Gossler </italic>cousins <italic>Amsinck</italic>, <italic>Donner</italic>, and <italic>Merck</italic> in-laws <italic>O\u2019Swald</italic> to form <italic>Commerzbank</italic> in 1870. With funding from <italic>Warburg</italic>,<italic> </italic><italic>Commerzbank</italic> branched to London and Hamburg by 1872. Jakob Lieben was instrumental in founding <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, serving as a director until his death in 1887. \nA descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe husband of a L\u00e4mel K\u00f6nigswarter wife, Lieben\u2019s Brandies niece had married Galician industrialist Benedikt Margulies and Auspitz niece-in-law married Max Auspitz Gomperz, a Moravian wholesale heir who joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s board in 1860. By 1871, Gomperz\u2019s Pressburger-Todesco niece, a relative of the Ephrussi, K\u00f6nigswarter, and Porges families, married Ignaz\u2019s son.\nAfter Prussian victory allowed Bismarck to unify North and South German currency and law, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> negotiated the French indemnity and, on behalf of Junkers, the acquisition of Strussberg\u2019s Romanian roads as he lost access to credit in 1871. When <italic>Disconto</italic> took over financing for these roads, Salomonsohn joined their supervisory boards. Although German kings ennobled Jews through the century\u2014including several Oppenheims around the 1860s\u2014Bavaria conferred knighthood upon Daniel Weisweiler in 1870 and Prussia ennobled Gerson Bleichr\u00f6der in 1872. \nIn Saxony, Eugen Guttman\u2014whose father was born into a rabbinical family in Prague and moved to Dresden in the 1830s, where he founded <italic>Guttman</italic>, dealing in commodities, currency exchange, and industrial loans\u2014persuaded Court Jew-descended and <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne-in-laws Kaskele barons to turn their bank into the joint-stock <italic>Dresdner Bank</italic>, and married a Warburg cousin Magnez in 1872. And in the Rhineland, <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne\u2019s cousin-in-laws <italic>Cahn</italic> of Bonn acquired <italic>Unterkattenbach</italic> ironworks, shares in 27 mining fields from <italic>Bochumer Verein </italic>in 1871. Buying more shares in 1872, including of <italic>United Sellerbeck</italic> mine.\nLike Strussberg, Andre Langrand lost access to credit. Even before the war, his investments flailed as <italic>Neerlandais</italic> was liquidated in 1868. As Langrand\u2019s <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Cr\u00e9dit Foncier International</italic> collapsed, Langrand faced fraudulent bankruptcy charges until the interference of his clergy acquaintances led to riots in Brussels. After fleeing to Brazil, he was ultimately convicted and sentenced to three years of demanding labor. When Drummond Wolff liquidated Langrand\u2019s <italic>International Land & Credit</italic>, Hirsch bought the Turkish assets, and took over Langrand\u2019s contract from Turkey to extend <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR. While Hirsch concluding agreements with <italic>Austrian</italic> RR,<italic> </italic><italic>Rothschild</italic> declined to join <italic>ORIENT</italic>. \n<italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> and <italic>Sursock</italic> lent to Egypt, collateralized by Pasha Ismael\u2019s feudal land pledges. Since 1869, <italic>Comptoir</italic> maintained an office in Alexandria to finance cotton. With the private ownership of land, French banks sprouted in Egypt, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais</italic> opened a branch office in Alexandria in 1874, followed by Cairo and Port Said over the next two years. While few Jews became landowners, the aristocratic Sarofim and other Christian Copt families increased their landholdings since the 1870s with financing from European Jews. \nWith increased trade since the opening of <italic>Suez Canal</italic>, global coal prices inflated as America, Europe, and Japan industrialized. So, investors funded banks, PUs, and roads across Austrian and German Silesia. Among the many that started was Bohemian Jewish Levite Moses Petschek, who built real estate wealth and married a Wertheim cousin-in-law before entering the soft coal industry in 1871. Since Moritz Friedl\u00e4nder started operations in 1840, his descendants transformed the moribund <italic>Moritzh\u00fctte</italic> into a joint-stock company with a royal charter in 1872. \nBefore economic reforms in Central and Eastern Europe ended feudal restrictions in the 1860s, Jews could only partner with Christian noblemen who provided resources, renting land for producing alcohol, sugar beets, and other goods. These restrictions also blocked Jews from textile making and other traditional industries, forcing them into railroads and other new industries. After <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna purchased <italic>Witkowitz</italic> ironworks and the rights to expand his railroad to Gmunden in the 1820s, David Gutmann to convince <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna to invest in developing coal in Moravia. With his brother Wilhelm, who had married a Katz-Latzko, David founded <italic>Gutmann</italic> in Vienna in 1853, which became a key supplier of coal to railroads, factories, and cities across Austria-Hungary. By 1859, David married his Katz-Latzko cousin. \nAfter <italic>Gutmann</italic> of leased <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s coal mines from 1865 and bought properties in Silesia, Galicia, and Hungary, widowed Wilhelm wed Moritz Porges\u2019 granddaughter and the cousin of Moritz Ulman\u2019s son-in-law in 1869. As <italic>Gutmann</italic> built Austria\u2019s first sugar factory in 1871, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> acquired coal mines in Silesia, and the following year, she partnered with <italic>Wiener</italic> and <italic>Gutmann</italic> to vertically integrate mining and metallurgy through <italic>Witkowitz</italic>. Still, they faced competition. In 1872, Karl Wittgenstein\u2014a Landau cousin-in-law and a Katz cousin descended from Joseph Goldschmidt and the uncles of Samuel Oppenheim and Lion Halphen Goudchaux\u2014joined his in-law\u2019s mill in<italic> Teplice</italic>.\nLikewise, from the 1860s, <italic>Creditanstalt </italic>and the Christian Czech mortgage <italic>Zivnostenska Bank </italic>played pivotal roles in supporting brewing, distilling, and sugar production in Bohemia and Moravia. <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s investments included Prince Schwarzenberg\u2019s sugar production and Mayou\u2019s factories. Through religious and familial ties, the Mayous were embedded in the interconnected networks of Moravian alcohol, Hungarian sugar, and Viennese finance. Two Mayou brothers cemented these connections by marrying the daughters of L\u00f6bl Winterstein, a distillery tenant in Ungarisch Brod.\nAfter Winterstein\u2019s death, his widow remarried Isak Jellinek, a distillery tenant in Drslawitz who had previously been married to a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and the Guggenheim family related to the L\u00e4mels. Among Jellinek\u2019s sons, one became a leader of industrial development in Budapest, while another, Adolf, pursued studies in Prague and Leipzig before becoming Vienna\u2019s Chief Rabbi in 1865. By 1852, another Jellinek relative married Karoline Schey, whose connections included the Rothschild, Landauer, Mandl, and Morpurgo families of Vienna. \nBy this time, the third Mayou brother, Abraham, became a distillery leaseholder in Posoritz and married Fanny Popper in 1847. Of unknown relation to Bohemian Primator Joachim Popper, Fanny\u2019s sister had married David Spitzer who, along with his brother-in-law Adolf Popper co-founded a factory in Ung-Ostra in 1862. From the same year, Abraham and his brother Hermann established several sugar factories, including Ung-Ostra in 1862, Ung-Hradisch in 1867, and Hatschein in 1868. Six years after Hermann\u2019s daughter married David Spitzer\u2019s son in 1866, Abraham\u2019s daughter strengthened familial ties by marrying a large landowner in Brzezolub who descended from Primator Joachim Popper and Koppel Frankel.\nWhile Anselm Rothschild led <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna, his cousin once removed, <italic>Stern</italic> heiress Henriette Speyer Stern, married Paris jeweler Georges Halphen. By 1869, Halphen transitioned into sugar refining, founding <italic>Paris Refinery</italic>. Along with <italic>Say</italic>, <italic>Sommier</italic>, and <italic>Lebaudy</italic>, <italic>Paris Refinery</italic> dominated wholesale refined sugar sales in the eastern market, exporting to Europe and South America. Aristocrats soon kinterlinked <italic>Say</italic> and <italic>Sommier</italic>. Since Louis Say, the son of a Huguenot banker, established <italic>Say</italic> refinery by 1832. Louis\u2019 granddaughters married the Marquis Brissac in 1866 and Prince Broglie in 1875. In between, Broglie\u2019s second cousin became a Sommier brother-in-law in 1873.\nMeanwhile, the Russian government granted Ukrainian concessions to British and French steelmakers, the latter backed by <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and carried out by <italic>Polyakov</italic>. As Yakov Polyakov moved to Taganrog, his brothers Samuel to Saint-Petersburg and Lazar to Moscow. While Yakov parlayed French capital into <italic>Azov Don Bank of Commerce</italic> at Rostov-on-Don in 1871, Lazar connections to high officials led grew his banking network to include <italic>Orlov Bank</italic>, <italic>Riazan Commercial Bank</italic> (later renamed <italic>Moscow International Commercial Bank</italic>), <italic>Moscow Land Bank</italic>, and <italic>Yaroslav-Kostroma Land Bank</italic> between 1870 and 1873. Polyakov\u2019s <italic>Moscow Land Bank</italic> had a virtual monopoly over credit in the central provinces for noble landowners. In 1872, <italic>Wilna</italic><italic> Land Bank</italic> became Lithuania\u2019s first joint-stock bank, serving large landlords. \nLike elsewhere, Jewish workers in Eastern Europe concentrated in light industries such as the manufacture of textiles, food, and clothing, unlike Christian workers, who primarily worked in heavy industries like steel. In Poland, cities like Bialystok and Lodz became centers of Jewish labor in the textile industry, while cigarette factories in Wilna and sugar plants in Kiew also employed many Jews. Jewish entrepreneurs, such as the Wissotsky and Brodsky families, established tea and sugar ventures. \nMany of Kiew\u2019s sugar magnates had Katz associations, including Katz-descendants <italic>Brodsky,</italic> <italic>Halpern</italic>, and Zak. Without fusion, these sugar beet plants floated separate joint-stocks on <italic>Kiew</italic><italic> Stock Exchange</italic>, including <italic>Sitkovets</italic> (1867), Halpern\u2019s<italic> Skomoroshki</italic> (1871), Brodsky and Horowitz\u2019s <italic>Makharinets</italic> (1873), <italic>Kalinovsk</italic> (1873), Brodsky\u2019s <italic>Tomashpol</italic> (1875), <italic>Bugaev</italic> (1886), and <italic>Maximovsky</italic> (1896). Since establishing a sugar refinery in Russian Moldova in 1861, Rafalovich built another by 1866. \nBetter transport connectivity also encouraged sugar entrepreneurs to start <italic>Moscow Commercial Loan Bank</italic> in 1870 and <italic>Kiew</italic><italic> Industrial Bank</italic> in 1871 to process agriculture. The latter was led by six <italic>Brodsky</italic> directors. Similarly, Moscow Old Believer Timofei Morozov separated <italic>Morozov</italic> from his cousin partners and acquired Russia\u2019s largest textile enterprise, <italic>Nikolskaia Manufactory</italic>, around Moscow. Within year, his wife Maria inherited her bachelor brother\u2019s assets, which she invested into <italic>Morozov</italic>. \nSince Samuel Natanson parlayed his soap and sugar trade into banking with <italic>Natanson</italic> in Warsaw in Russian Poland in 1866, Leo Kronenberg founded <italic>Handlowy Bank</italic> with <italic>Lyonnais</italic> and native agrarian capital in 1870, branching to Saint-Petersburg within a year by forming <italic>Saint-Petersburg Discount Bank</italic>. Since most of Leo\u2019s siblings converted to Calvinism, <italic>Kronenberg</italic> of Warsaw marry-partnered a Paris banker Oppenheim of unknown lineage in 1860. \nHaving kinterlinked with a Toeplitz in 1851, Kronenberg marry-partnered with <italic>Toeplitz</italic>\u2019s Jan Bloch in 1862. Since the Bloch brothers\u2014third great-grandsons of Katz-descendant Zevi Ashkenasy and cousins of the Hamburger and Goldschmidt families\u2014converted to Catholicism and joined <italic>Toeplitz</italic> before overseeing the extension of <italic>Saint-Petersburg-Warsaw</italic> RR in 1857. While his brother moved to Vienna in 1860, Jan remained in Poland. Along with building railroads, Bloch co-founded <italic>Handlowy Bank</italic>, and had interests in sugar production and timber. In 1872, Kronenberg co-founded <italic>Warsaw</italic> <italic>Sugar</italic>.\nWhile Rafalovich-in-law Henryk Toeplitz and his brother Bonawentura co-founded <italic>Handlowy Bank</italic> and <italic>Warsaw</italic> <italic>Sugar</italic>, Bonawentura later directed <italic>Rau</italic>, which had connections with <italic>Laski</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>. By 1871, Herman Epshteyn\u2019s son created <italic>Warsaw Discount Bank</italic> with <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> after apprenticing at <italic>Lambert</italic> and Wilhelm Lando\u2014of a likely but unknown Landau relation\u2014branched his Warsaw bank to Lodz. Likewise, other Jews opened more banks with foreign capital. Having kinterlinked with Natanson, Epshteyn and Natanson joined Kronenberg as board members of <italic>Warsaw Stock Exchange</italic> from the 1870s.  \nA branch of Kronenberg\u2019s <italic>Handlowy Bank</italic>, the large <italic>Saint-Petersburg Discount Bank</italic> included <italic>Eliseev</italic> and <italic>Gunzburg </italic>as investors and soon under the leadership of Gunzburg and Epstein cousins Zak on the invitation of Kronenberg. (Refusing the post of Russia\u2019s Vice Finance Minister conditional of converting, Zak remained Jewish.) Along financing <italic>Saint-Petersburg Discount Bank</italic> and <italic>Ziemia\u0144ski</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>, <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Saint-Petersburg co-founded insurers and joint-stock banks, including <italic>Kiew</italic><italic> Private Commercial Bank</italic>, <italic>Bank of Foreign Trade</italic>, and <italic>Siberian Bank of Commerce</italic> from 1868 to 1872. \nAlong with funding <italic>Bank of Foreign Trade </italic>with<italic> Ephrussi, Eliseev</italic> co-founded <italic>Lloyd</italic> Russia in 1871<italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>As <italic>Warshavsky</italic> constructed and managed <italic>Moscow-Brest </italic>RR by partnering with a <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> relative. So did Zak with <italic>Libau-Romanov </italic>RR, <italic>Kronenberg </italic>with <italic>Warsaw-Taraspol</italic> RR, and <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> built <italic>Kiew</italic><italic>-Brest</italic> RR. By 1874, <italic>Kronenberg</italic> and <italic>Natanson</italic> established <italic>Warsaw Coal & Metallurgy</italic>. \nWhile Ludwik Kronenberg was an agent of <italic>Bank of Poland</italic> and <italic>Warsaw Stock Exchange</italic>, his first guild merchant brother owned <italic>Kronenberg</italic> and directed <italic>Warsaw Stock Exchange</italic> from 1876. The brothers\u2019 nephew married a daughter of Alex Goldstand in 1881, whose father co-owned <italic>Frankel</italic> and was a <italic>Bank of Poland</italic> counselor. While Alex was a <italic>Warsaw Discount Bank</italic> VP, <italic>Bank</italic> <italic>of Poland</italic> counselor, Commercial Tribunal judge, and <italic>Warsaw Stock Exchange</italic> director from 1876, his brother directed <italic>S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Petersburg</italic><italic> Discount</italic><italic> Bank</italic>. \nGoldstand had married a daughter of Josephine Rosen\u2014whose siblings had wed a Toeplitz and Epshteyn\u2014and Mikolaj Gutmann. Gutmann\u2019s sister had married Alex Rawicz. Since transforming <italic>Zbytkower</italic> to <italic>Hirschendorf Rawicz</italic> in 1825, Rawicz served as Elder of <italic>Warsaw Stock Exchange</italic> from 1849 to 1864, commercial counselor of <italic>Bank of Poland</italic>, and Commercial Tribunal judge. After his death in1865, his heirs took over his bank.\nMeanwhile, Teomin Katz-descendant and Gunzburg cousins Louri\u00e9 helped commercialize and industrialize Russian Belarus and Latvia. While widow Chaya Louri\u00e9 was one of Belarus\u2019 wealthiest women, one of her sons married into the Eiger family bankers and Chief Rabbis of Kalisch and Posen. As another son built a steam-powered flourmill in 1865, later adding an oil-press, his cousin David established a bank in Minsk and founded <italic>Louri\u00e9</italic> to operate steamboats. Together they formed a commercial and banking network. \nAs David married his Eliasberg cousin\u2014related to Rabbi Ezekiel Landau\u2014their two sons married other cousins, while four other sons became bankers: Samuel at Pinsk, Isiodore at Minsk, Isser at Warsaw, and Aaron at Kiew. They also formed branches in Dubno, Luzk, and Zhitomir, Polonnoye. After a drought in 1866, refugees fled to Pinsk. Chaya established a camp, providing food, clothes, and funds, and organized steamboats for their journey. Over two years, she saved thousands from death. In 1865, she built charitable a hospital, a synagogue, and an old-age home. Chaya was recognized by Tsar Alex II, becoming an honorary citizen along with her family. \nHaving developed a near monopoly on rubber production, <italic>Louri\u00e9</italic> joined <italic>Eliseev </italic>and Christian landowners to found <italic>Commercial Bank of Minsk</italic> by 1873. Alex Wrangel, a Russian-born descendant of Junkers with a large Baltic estate, became Chair of<italic> Commercial Bank of Minsk</italic>. For Vice Director, <italic>Commercial Bank of Minsk</italic> hired Chonon Wengeroff, a Minsk tax farmer, who had married Pauline, a granddaughter of Luria descendant Simeon Epstein, who was also a cousin of the Gunzburg and Zak bankers. \nSince the 1850s, Latvian Riga\u2019s timber market rapidly expanded due to industrialization and increasing demand for wood products. Located strategically on the Baltic coast, Riga capitalized on access to vast forested areas along the River Dvina. While steam-powered machinery boosted production efficiency, Riga ports facilitated exports to Saint-Petersburg, Hamburg, and London. \nRiga\u2019s primary drivers of this timber-based industry were (mostly Hasidic) Jews, who increased from 5,254 to 20,013 between 1867 and 1880. By 1874, a timber arrival list for Riga named 28 traders, including Baltic German <italic>Schepeler</italic>, but most entries were Jewish, such as Salomon Berlin, Leibe Schalit, Schaie Libenson, and Schmul Lurja. Jews used their positions in intermediary trade to enter direct timber export and sawmill ownership.\nDescended from Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, Witebsk-born Schaie Berlin settled in Riga in the 1850s, and apprenticed in timber trade. In the 1860s, he married Chaya Schneurson, a Katz-descendant and great-granddaughter of Schneur Zalman, the founder of Chabad Hasidim, who affiliated with <italic>Polyakov</italic>, <italic>Halpern</italic> of Berdichev, and other bankers. \nAs Berlin acquired extensive land holdings and established sawmills along the Dvina, his nephew married <italic>Halpern</italic>\u2019s grandson. Likewise, the Schneurson and Berlin families kinterlinked and partnered with Shalit, Hindin, and other Hasidim engaged in timber cutting, export, and refining for wood alcohol. An extended cousin of the earlier mentioned Schneursons and Berlins, Katz-descendent Chaim Berlin served as Chief Rabbi of Moscow from 1865 until 1888.\nHasidism also connected Russian trade to Galician Tarnow since the Landau family held sway over Jewish Tarnow, in between Lemberg and Krakau, and the Ickowicz and Teomin Frankel families dominated in the 1740s. By the mid-19th century, the Szif, Lezer, Wechsler, and Aberdam families dominated religious and economic life. Controlling Tarnow\u2019s ironworks, Yossel Szif kinterlinked with descendants of Katz and Baal Shem Tov. \nWhile Wolf Lezer oversaw the city\u2019s cloth and silk trade, his daughter Hana married Zecharia Aberdam, and her sister married Moshe Teomin Frankel Wechsler, a <italic>Halpern</italic> extended cousin and a descendant of the Katz, Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, and Ezekiel Landau families. (<italic>Wechsler </italic>derives from a German word for <italic>money changer</italic>.) Likewise, Lezer brothers married extended cousins of Horace Landau and <italic>Halpern</italic>. While Hana managed the family bank, her brother, husband, and Wechsler brother-in-law specialized in credit, lending, and investment through promissory notes.\nMeanwhile, assimilated German Jews linked empires. Since financing British <italic>Reuter</italic> in 1851, <italic>Erlanger</italic> banked <italic>Reuter</italic>\u2019s first trans-Atlantic French cable firm to connect Brest to the Saint-Lawrence River in 1869. Paul Reuter was born Israel Josaphat as the third son of Rabbi Samuel Levi Josaphat of Kassel and later clerked at his uncle\u2019s Gottingen bank. He became familiar with telegraphy at <italic>Gottingen</italic> <italic>Uni</italic> and, in 1845, converted to Protestantism, changed his name to Paul Reuter, and married a Frankel daughter of Berlin banker Friedrich Magnus, who funded his ventures. \nA year after taking over a Berlin publishing business in 1847, he fled to Paris amidst the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic> due to charges of spreading \u2018democratic\u2019 pamphlets, and worked as a translator for <italic>Havas</italic>, a news agency founded by Charles-Louis Havas in 1835. Briefly returning to Germany, Reuter moving to London in 1851, and established <italic>Reuter</italic> with <italic>Erlanger</italic>. After being ennobled in Germany in 1871, Queen Victoria allowed Reuter to use the titles in Britain, and he soon formed a secret cartel with <italic>Havas</italic> in Paris and Bernhard Wolff\u2019s Berlin news agency to secure exclusive market. Germany largest news bureau, <italic>Wolff</italic>, came under the influence of the state via Chancellor Bismarck\u2019s banker<italic> </italic><italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> in the 1870s.\nAs Tsar Alex II renewed the 1866 legislation granting Russian citizenship to select Bukharan Jews for another six years in 1872, several endogamous Bukharan Jewish families factored the Central Asian cotton industry and joined Russian trade guilds to trade across Eurasia using caravans. With credit from Moscow banks and often under the guidance of rabbinical leaders, the communities\u2019 textile factories soon began to rival their Old Believer counterparts in Moscow.\nSoon after, the Persian Shah Nasr Din granted the concession to British telegraphy pioneer Paul Reuter, who joined forces with <italic>Sassoon</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and Drummond Wolff, Britain\u2019s minister in Tehran. Although <italic>Thomson Bonar</italic> and <italic>Rodocanachi</italic> established <italic>Russian London Bank</italic> in 1871, she soon ceased operations along with <italic>English </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Russian Bank</italic> of 1863 as Nasr Din soon annulled the concession following Russian opposition.\nMuch of the banking developed Ukrainian agriculture. Since <italic>Kiew</italic><italic> Private Commercial Bank</italic> in 1868 to finance sugar industry, <italic>Kiew</italic><italic> Industrial Bank</italic> commenced operations in 1871. Starting in the same year, the Kiew branch of <italic>Russian Foreign Trade Bank</italic>, known as the \u2018sugar bank\u2019, rose to prominence thanks to its links with the \u2018sugar syndicate.\u2019 Others expanded by establishing new branches in emerging grain trade ports like <italic>Rodocanachi</italic> in Nikolayev, Mariupol, and Rostov-on-Don, while <italic>Mahs</italic> supplied wheat to Odessa, Kiew, Brody, Lemberg, and the Austrian Galicia frontier. \nAfter <italic>Odessa Commercial Bank</italic> started in 1870, <italic>Commercial Bank of Nikolayev</italic> and Rafalovich co-founded <italic>Land Bank of Bessarabia & Kherson</italic> were established in 1872. Likewise, <italic>Azov-Don Commercial Bank</italic>, founded in 1871 in Taganrog, by <italic>Scaramanga</italic>, <italic>Vagliano</italic>, and Yakov Polyakov sought to promote southern industry and export firms, but internal conflicts eventually led to its takeover by Polyakov and other Saint-Petersburg-based partners, relocating its headquarters to the capital. \nAfter hereditary Christian merchant of Kharkov Alexey Alchevsky founded coal focused <italic>Kharkov Land Bank</italic> in 1871, his close partner Lazar Polyakov founded <italic>Southern Russia Coal </italic>in Ukraine in 1872. Still, British and German coal sold in Saint-Peterburg for a fraction of prices of Ukrainian coal. In that city, <italic>Moscow Merchant Bank</italic>, <italic>Moscow Commercial Credit Society</italic>, and <italic>Trade Bank</italic> financed petty noble Nikolai Putilov\u2019s chartered steel company <italic>Putilov </italic><italic>Works</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Moscow Merchant Bank</italic> acquired <italic>Moscow-Kursk</italic> RR, connecting to the steel industry in the Urals. \nSince <italic>Warburg</italic> of Hamburg sent their sons to woo Russian bankers during America\u2019s Civil War, Siegmund Warburg married Theophile Gunzburg Rosenberg, the daughter of Katz-cousin Hessel Rosenberg, who became a Saint-Petersburg guild merchant and Ukrainian forest magnate. Likewise, Theophile\u2019s sister Anna married her cousin Horace Gunzburg, whose sister wed Katz-cousin Paul Fould in Paris. After Duke Louis III of Hesse-Darmstadt ennobled Horace Gunzburg in 1870, Russia allow the family to use the titles. Theophile\u2019s sister Rosa married Joseph Hirsch of Bavaria and <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>, Rosalie wed Siegmund Herzfelder of Budapest, and Louise with Katz-descendant Moisey Ashkenasy\u2019s son, Eugene. Meanwhile, railroads and banks promoted mining of all sorts.  \nSimilarly, <italic>Jardine</italic> started Spanish industry by funding <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> mining. In the Rhineland, <italic>Cahn</italic> acquired shares in <italic>Vereinigte P\u00fctzborn </italic>and <italic>Wilhelmsh\u00fctte </italic>by 1875. <italic>Cahn</italic> authorized <italic>Wertheim</italic> of Frankfurt to subscribe for shares in <italic>Wachstuchfabrik</italic>. With private coal roads competing with public roads, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Deutsche</italic> co-founders <italic>Schlesische</italic> and <italic>Delbr\u00fcck</italic> partnered with Count Henckel Donnersmarck to create HCs to consolidate Silesian coal roads and West German coal. By early 1873, Germany agreed to abolish iron tariffs in 1877. Also that year, Bleichr\u00f6der also joined <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt\u2019s bond syndicate to expand <italic>Austrian</italic> RR into Italy. \nSince the Dutch lifted Indonesian tariffs in 1865, the opening of <italic>Suez Canal</italic> in 1869 stimulated commerce in the Dutch East Indies, banks also consolidated. Although <italic>Neerlandais</italic> had collapsed by then, her <italic>East Indies Trading Bank </italic>thrived. Around 1870, <italic>Internationale Credieten</italic> faced significant financial losses, leading to a halving of her share nominal value. By 1872, <italic>Internationale </italic>recovered and secured new capital, despite continued reliance on plantation advances due to the underdeveloped colonial banking. From 1872, losses forced <italic>Rotterdamsche Bank</italic> to focus on Dutch operations and sell her Indies exchange business to <italic>Chartered Bank of India, Australia & China.</italic> British competitors like <italic>Chartered Mercantile Bank</italic> and <italic>Oriental Bank</italic> maintained limited operations. So, the Dutch stimulated coal, and drilling oil drilling in the Indies.\nOil further deflated as Russia prevented cartels, leading <italic>Moscow Merchant Bank</italic>\u2019s Old Believer Kokorev, and other drillers to deflate Azeri oil prices for export from 1871. By 1872, Boryslaw of Austrian Galicia had nearly 12,000 crude oil wells utilizing wax for paraffin candles, predominantly owned by Jews, with over 10,000 employees. While several large operations emerged, most were small and inefficient. Moreover, Europe imported oil from Canada.\nWhile oil was discovered in Ontario, Canada, contemporaneously as in America, the federal government after the Canadian Confederation in 1867 imposed tariffs on refined oil imports to protect the domestic industry from American competition. Among the key entrepreneurs were Jacob Englehart, a Cleveland-born Jew of Bavarian descent, and his brother-in-law Abraham Dryfoos. During America\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic>, the pair, along with Solomon Sonneborn, traded whisky and were avoiding American taxes in Canada. After building a refinery in Petrolia, Ontario, Englehart partnered with Ebenezer Higgins from Chicago to monopolize Canadian refining. \nWhile the first scheme, cartel efforts followed, such as <italic>Lambton</italic> <italic>Crude Oil Partnership</italic> in 1871, stabilizing prices. However, John Fairbank\u2014an extended cousin of the <italic>Clark</italic>, <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>, and Boston Brahmin families\u2014backed James Williams to create a new refining company outside cartel control. Canada\u2019s oil industry in Petrolia saw production increase from 190,000 barrels in 1868 to 365,000 barrels by 1873.\nWith <italic>Suez</italic>, fuel, and steamers, ruinous competition spread to shipping globally. As ruinous competition toppled her opium trade leadership in favor of the \u2018legitimate\u2019 textile trade,<italic> Jardine</italic> established a silk operation in 1870 and opened <italic>Tung Yuan</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> in Peking. As <italic>Sassoon</italic> cornered the Indian opium market, <italic>Jardine</italic> withdrew from opium. Since <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s <italic>Shanghai </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> dominated Yangtze River steam traffic, British trader <italic>Butterfield Swire</italic> founded <italic>China </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> in Shanghai in 1872, Kuang-yang refused to join the comprador-like <italic>China Merchants </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> that was being set up in 1873, preventing zaibatsu formation. \nIn the Spanish Philippines, since Chinese mestizo merchant Basilio adopted the name Lopez, he became Cabeza de Barangay from 1842 and one of the first to acquire haciendas. By the 1860s, his children bought sugar lands from Iloilo to Negros. Like his father, Eugenio served as Cabeza de Barangay from 1870. As sugar replaced the weaving in Visayas in 1879, Eugenio bought plantations. From Spain\u2019s Civil War of 1871, Basque refuges also fled to the Philippines. By 1873, <italic>Olano Larrinaga</italic> secured a contract for Philippines transport, solidifying its dominance over the Liverpool-C\u00e1diz-Barcelona-<italic>Suez</italic>-Ceylon-Singapore-Manila route. As <italic>Aldecoa</italic> sponsored Basque immigration, including the Aboitiz family, which soon traded abaca.\nIn Japan, Iwasaki small fleet drove out most private operators. As the global fuel prices and investments collapsed in the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> and shocked credit, Japan fixed undefined interest rates at 6% against usury. So, Iwasaki small fleet waged a shipping rate war against <italic>Steamship</italic>, defeating the latter in 1874. As Inoue resigned from the <italic>Finance Ministry</italic> and dissolved <italic>Senshu</italic>, he and Mitsui started competing trading companies. Amidst the crisis, <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s <italic>Shanghai </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> and <italic>Swire</italic>\u2019s <italic>China </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> developed a pooling arrangement in 1874. As <italic>Russell</italic> collapsed in 1875, <italic>Baring</italic> and other bankers switched from partnering with individual shippers to specialize as mostly-Scottish shippers cartelized Anglo-Indian shipping. \nCartels also spread in Britain. Before the collapse of raw sugar prices since <italic>Suez</italic>, Liverpool-born Henry Tate. After apprenticing as a sugar refiner since 1859, Tate founded <italic>Tate</italic> with his sons in 1869 and established refineries in Liverpool in 1870 and on the Thames in 1878. Abram Lyle, born in 1820, shifted from his father\u2019s cooperage to shipping before founding <italic>Lyle</italic> in 1881, focusing on syrup. Despite operating in proximity on the Thames, Tate and Lyle never met personally. Their refineries thrived independently with an understanding: <italic>Lyle</italic> did not produce cubes and <italic>Tate</italic> did not produce syrup.\nWhile India\u2019s chartered Presidency banks continued competing, <italic>Sassoon</italic> initiated negotiations between <italic>Bank of Bengal</italic> and (the new) <italic>Bank of Bombay</italic> in 1872 but soon failed. The same year, the Government of India considered ending its association with the chartered banks. In 1874, the Government of India desired to lend to famine-struck Bengal but was unable to withdraw 30 of the 100 lakhs deposited with <italic>Bank of Bombay</italic>. Having lent most of the funds on the money market, <italic>Bank of Bombay</italic> had been renting the funds from the Government by paying a deficiency interest. Despite the apparent legality, the Government advocated the removal of funds from the Presidency banks into new Reserve Treasuries. \nAs peasants revolted against Marwari lenders in the <italic>Deccan Riots</italic> to destroy debt records in 1875, the Government reintroduced Presidency bank lending controls and reduced government deposits by 1876, so that discounts and loans collapsed in Bombay and Madras, respectably. As the Government sold her chartered bank shares, <italic>Bank of Bengal</italic> and <italic>Bank of Madras</italic> purchased their shares, and <italic>Sassoon</italic> acquired those of <italic>Bank of Bombay</italic>. Although the State Department Secretary recommended the distribution of assets across other banks, the Government continued to ignore banking reform. \nWith the collapse of credit, Bombay and Madras experienced the worst famine and corporate dissolutions in a century.  After the government allowed rural insolvency filings, peasants refused to file for decades for fear of credit loss. But industrialization continued. Since helping form <italic>Bank of Hindustan</italic> in 1862, <italic>Cazenove</italic> brokered Nizam\u2019s <italic>Hyderabad</italic> <italic>State </italic>RR in the 1870s and raised funding for <italic>Bengal Central Flotilla Co</italic> in 1883 to link Khoolna and Burrisaul with steamships. Since becoming the first Indian-promoted institution by overcoming opposition from moneylending classes with support from the Nawab of Rampore in 1862, <italic>Bank of Rohilkund</italic> merged with the new Indian-promoted <italic>Oudh Commercial Bank</italic> in 1881 in Faizabad, but remained a local concern with only two branches.\nAfter <italic>British</italic><italic> Companies Act</italic><italic> of </italic><italic>1862</italic>, Samuel Laing\u2014who served as private secretary for Henry Baring Labouchere and then cooperated in investments with <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2014and Philip Rose\u2014 Benjamin Disraeli\u2019s legal and financial agent\u2014helped form and manage <italic>General Credit & Finance Co</italic>, a cr\u00e9dit mobilier to act as an investment principal, like <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>in France. Building on this experience, in 1868 they founded <italic>Foreign </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Colonial Government Trust</italic>, with <italic>Glyn</italic> as banker and trustees including <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s George Currie and Eustace Cecil, son of Marquis of Salisbury, cousin-once-removed-in-law of Smyth, and cousin-in-law of the Duncombes and <italic>Beckett</italic>. \nIn 1873, the same trustees created <italic>American Investment Trust</italic> to invest in American railway securities. At the same time, <italic>Scottish American Investment Trust</italic> formed, with trustees including Cashier of <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic> James Fleming and representatives from <italic>British Linen Co</italic>, <italic>National Bank of Scotland</italic>, and <italic>Standard Life Assurance</italic>. Their success inspired the creation of other trusts, including <italic>Scottish American Investment</italic>, <italic>Scottish American Mortgage</italic>, and others in Dundee and Edinburgh. During the <italic>trusts</italic> boom Dundee specialized in America, Glasgow in South Africa, and Edinburgh in Australia, supplying a third of the latter\u2019s external capital.\nBy 1876, <italic>Jardine</italic> completed China\u2019s first railroad\u2014<italic>Shanghai-Woosung</italic> RR\u2014that Chinese opposition prevented since 1865. From 1877, <italic>Jardine</italic> formed <italic>China Coast </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>, <italic>Yangtze </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>, <italic>China Sugar Refinery</italic>, and <italic>Hong Kong Tramways</italic> by 1884. Following <italic>Jardine</italic> in manufacturing silk in China, <italic>Russell</italic> sold her properties and place in the pool to <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s <italic>China Merchants</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>. That year, a <italic>Jardine</italic> partner became a director of HSBC, shrinking the rift between the two. As <italic>Jardine</italic> formed <italic>Indo-China </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> in 1881 and joined the pool, <italic>Jardine</italic> dominated Chinese shipping. Despite British competition, <italic>Hoong On</italic> and other Chinese shippers grew. From 1882, Kuang-yung began developing telegraphs along the Yangtze River.\nHowever, Russia disapproved of a Turkish to link with Austria from 1868, watching in dread as<italic> </italic>Hirsch consolidated <italic>ORIENT</italic> RR politically and financially. While continuing to promise Britain that she would not annex territory, Russia occupied Samarkand, Khiva, and Kokand in Central Asia. As the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> disrupted <italic>TURK</italic> and <italic>Hirsch</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London funded Britain to buy<italic> Suez</italic><italic> </italic>as <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna stabilized the Austrian government. While Austria passed a law in 1872 to extend <italic>Austrian</italic> RR from Tarnow to Leluchow, through the Galician frontier into Moravia, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> and other bankers did not invest. As a revised 1873 law provided state guarantees, work began, and by 1876, T<italic>arn</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>w-Leluch</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>w</italic> and <italic>Leluch</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>w-Orl</italic><italic>o</italic> lines opened on the Emperor\u2019s birthday.\nAlong with the collapses of her mining boom, Austria suffered from the withdrawal of commission and arbitrage houses like <italic>Ladenburg</italic>, <italic>Ellissen</italic>, and <italic>Speyer</italic> from Vienna. Likewise, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>\u2019s <italic>Austrian General </italic>failed.<italic> </italic>After <italic>First Serbian Bank</italic> collapsed, <italic>Franco-Austrian Bank</italic> soon followed. While some banker families bailed out insolvents, not all were successful. Since Hirsch\u2019s cousin Ida Hirsch Kaulla was married Septime Avigdor, who led <italic>Avigdor</italic> of Nice for twenty-five years. However, after his employees embezzled funds in 1874, Avigdor committed suicide in November 1874 even after his father-in-law transmitted funds. During the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Anna Rosenberg, Horace Gunzburg\u2019s wife, convinced <italic>Gunzburg</italic> to assist her brother-in-law\u2019s <italic>Herzfelder</italic> in settling debts by offering to sell her jewels. \nBy 1874, Anna\u2019s sister married Joseph Hirsch and<italic> Gunzburg</italic> invested in Russian gold mines. With Moisey Ashkenasy retiring in 1875, his son Eugene took over <italic>Ashkenasy</italic>. Russian \u2018railway kings\u2019 squeezed out small investors. As Russia raised funds to link the Urals and Poland via Ukraine in 1874, she offered guarantee enticements. But amidst the high demand, <italic>Polyakov</italic>, <italic>Warsha</italic><italic>v</italic><italic>sky</italic>, and others<italic> </italic>gained control. As Samuel Polyakov\u2019s daughter married <italic>Warsha</italic><italic>v</italic><italic>sky</italic> heir Leon, brother-in-law of a Bischoffsheim Cah\u00e9n, whose siblings married Montefiore and Morpurgo.\nThat year, Russia eased Old Believer marriage laws. The same year, Jewish Grigory Hesin extended a telegraph line through Turkestan\u2019s Semirechensk and Syrdarya and Strussberg used Russian funds from the <italic>Moscow Commercial Loan Bank</italic> to resume his business. Russia arrested Strussberg on fraud charges, German and Austrian bankruptcy proceedings ended Strussberg\u2019s career and fortune. Moreover, crisis brought down <italic>Moscow Commercial Loan Bank</italic>, spreading to associated Ukrainian banks and sugar manufacturers, destabilizing that trade for two years. In 1875, Odessa faced a severe economic downturn, marked by the foreclosure of 116 properties valued at 2.6 million <italic>rubles</italic> by three local banks. \nEmployment opportunities were scarce, leading to extreme hardship among itinerant laborers. While the main importer of colonial goods and the proprietor of the sole wool washing enterprise committed suicide, a large brewery and distillery liquidated. As Moscow and Kiew bank branches shuttered due to their inability to recover real estate loans, so did <italic>Odessa Commercial Bank</italic> in 1878. Although <italic>Schepeler</italic> Riga continued since the <italic>Panic of 1869</italic> forced <italic>Schepeler</italic> New York into bankruptcy, the house suspended in 1876 in Riga and Antwerp along with timber traders, destabilizing <italic>Riga Commercial Bank</italic>. Instead of Russia and Ukraine production, improved transport and favorable taxes allowed Warsaw to lead sugar refining in the empire. Ge-politics also benefited Poland. \nAmidst the supply disruption of the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, railroad car shortages led Russia to build more Donetsk coal roads to link to Ukrainian industrial centers. Still, British and German coal sold in Saint-Peterburg for a fraction of prices of Ukrainian coal. By 1876, Saint-Petersburg steel factory <italic>Putilov Works</italic> defaulted on interest payments. As <italic>Moscow Merchant Banks</italic> demanded repayment, <italic>Imperial State Bank</italic> intervened, taking control of <italic>Putilov</italic> to stabilize the situation. These factories soon ramped up production.\nMeanwhile, Moldovan banker Moshe Waldberg played a key role in negotiating the 1875 trade agreement between the Austria and Romania, for which he was elevated to the nobility. Months later, as Slavic nationalist protests erupted in Turkish Bosnia-Hercegovina (\u201cBosnia\u201d) and Bulgaria, Turkish repression allowed Russian diplomats to exploit the \u2018Christian\u2019 cause for foreign political reasons. Invading the Balkans in 1877, Russian sought to drive Turkey out Europe and establish a Slav Bulgaria. \nContinuing to prevent monopolization, Russia sanctioned a Ukrainian coal and steel cartel as the war disrupted Black Sea commodities and trade. For funding, Russia<italic> </italic>relied on <italic>Polyakov</italic> and <italic>Gunzburg</italic>, who marry-partnered with <italic>Rafalovich</italic> and <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, respectively. (Lazar Polyakov married Annette Rafalovich after her Leonino husband died.) \nAs Romania sided with Russia, <italic>Marmorosch </italic>supplied both allies\u2019 armies with supplies in 1877. Since <italic>L\u00f6bel</italic>, <italic>Marmorosch</italic>, <italic>Camondo</italic>\u2019s in-law <italic>Halfon</italic>, Adolf Hertz, and Prince Ion Ghica co-founded <italic>Romania Bank</italic> as a <italic>TURK</italic> branch, along with in 1865, <italic>Rural Credit </italic>of 1873 and <italic>Urban Credit </italic>of 1874 relied solely on domestic capital. So, <italic>Marmorosch </italic>became Romania\u2019s dominant bank as Marmorosch\u2019s in-law <italic>L\u00f6bel</italic> banked in Vienna and kinterlinked with a Katz-Bondi descendent cousin of the Wertheim, Porges, and L\u00e4mel Mauthner families associated with <italic>Creditan</italic><italic>s</italic><italic>talt</italic>. In neighboring Austrian Bukovina that year, <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> branched to Czernowitz over a decade after <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, helping fund joint-stock woodworking plants.\nSince financing the Ottoman Empire, <italic>TURK</italic> masked allegiances of individual investors. After <italic>TURK</italic> co-founder Abraham Camondo died in 1873, the Ottoman Sultan shuttered <italic>Constantinople Stock Exchange</italic> in mourning. But Camondo relatives managing Turkish enterprises faced increasing pollical headwinds. Migrating to France, Abraham\u2019s grandson B\u00e9hor<italic> </italic>took over <italic>Camondo</italic> Paris and his sister married Bucharest banker Michel Halfon, B\u00e9hor was directed <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier Espagnol</italic> from 1876. That year, the <italic>Camondo</italic> and <italic>Halfon</italic> co-founded <italic>Bank of Bucharest</italic>. By 1877, Hortense Camondo Halfon married Katz cousin David Ellissen, a descendant of Michel Speyer and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister. While David was a banker in Paris, his brother Albert founded <italic>French</italic> <italic>General Gas Co</italic> and became a Director of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> in 1879.\nDistrustful of Russian intentions, Disraeli joined with Bismarck to protect Turkey. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> involvement sympathized with Disraeli\u2019s pro-Turkish policy, they were financially committed to Russia, causing conflicting interests. The situation escalated as Serbia and Montenegro joined the anti-Turkish revolt, and Britain\u2019s PM Gladstone criticized the atrocities in Bulgaria. However, Disraeli\u2019s attempt for Austria to split from the Christian <italic>Holy Alliance </italic>failed, and he lost two senior ministers over the issue. Foiling Russian goals, the <italic>Treaty of Berlin</italic> left Bulgaria Turkish, made Bosnia and Serbia economic and political satellites of Austria, and freed Slav Serbia and Latin Romania. \nThe <italic>Russo-Turkish War </italic>inflicted a major blow on Greek shipowners when London insurers excluded them from the London market, stating that their policies \u2018warranted no Greek or Turkish flag.\u2019 In response, <italic>Vagliano</italic> chartered unused Greek owned vessels\u2014probably at much lower freight rates\u2014and undertook the insurance of cargoes and vessels; their personal acquaintance and long-term collaboration with the Greek sailing shipowners helped them to figure out whom to trust.\nDuring the Bulgarian Uprising of 1876, Bulgarian Orthodox Evstati Geshov sought British protection due to political unrest and threats in Plovdiv. His arrest in 1877 spurred British diplomatic intervention, securing his release. As Turkey forbade foreign trade on the Black Sea in the <italic>Russo-Turkish War of 1877</italic>, Geshov suffered losses. Since Bulgaria\u2019s Liberation from Ottoman rule in 1878, Geshov-in-laws Burovs expanded into politics and kinterlinked with the Teodorovs of the<italic> </italic>conservative party, who strategically forged marriage alliances with entrepreneur Gubidelnikov of Russe, an important newspaper editor, and others. \nLikewise, after generations of trading, Sephardi Ari\u00e9 of Samokov around Sofia kinterlinked with Kuyumdji and other prominent Bulgarian Jewish families. As Nisim Ari\u00e9 led a refugee relief effort during the <italic>Russo-Turkish War</italic>, supported by Baron Hirsch. However, Ari\u00e9\u2019s influence declined after the war with the rise of <italic>TURK</italic>. After the Liberation from Ottoman rule in 1878, with the establishment of <italic>Bulgarian National Bank</italic> in 1879. Private banks without foreign capital also emerged, notably <italic>Girdap Bank</italic>. Established in 1881 in Ruse, Bulgaria, <italic>Girdap</italic> was the first joint-stock credit institution in the country. Shareholders enjoyed significant control, including audit rights and mandatory meeting attendance, aligning politically with conservatives.\nHowever, Camondo and Bleichr\u00f6der, and other Court Jews delayed recognition of the <italic>Treaty of Berlin</italic>, seeking Jewish refugees from Russian pogroms to obtain Romanian citizenship. While the Great Powers conditioned independence of Serbia, Romania, and Montenegro and the autonomy of Bulgaria upon the granting of full equality to all subjects regardless of religion, they did not require pledges to cease continuing political antisemitism as <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR advanced. \nAs <italic>Marmorosch </italic>financed <italic>Buzau-Marasesti</italic> RR and other industry from 1879, <italic>Halfon</italic> kinterlinked with a Pereire, descended from Katz, Oulma, and Fould, in Paris. Since <italic>Halfon</italic>,<italic> Marmorosch</italic>\u2019s in-law Isaak L\u00f6bel, Adolf Hertz, and Prince Ion Ghica co-founded <italic>Romania Bank</italic> as a <italic>TURK</italic> branch in 1865, L\u00f6bel\u2019s daughter married Moldovan banker Sigmund Byk Rottenberg, a second cousin of Alex Byk, by 1873. Rottenberg\u2019s sister was married to Moldovan Galatz banker Jacques Rubenstein. In 1880, <italic>Romania Bank</italic> transformed into <italic>Romanian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>with a note issuance monopoly. Christian co-founder Emil Costinescu, former Editor of <italic>Rom\u00e2nul</italic> and politician, became President of the central bank.\nAs crisis continued in Ukraine with <italic>Odessa Commercial Bank</italic> closed in 1878 after less than a decade of operation. After Joseph Gunzburg died in 1878, his son Solomon took over <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Paris and his son Horace took over <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Saint- Petersburg and shepherding Saint-Petersburg\u2019s Jewry. Although <italic>Stiglitz</italic> liquidated, French capital rushed into Russia as <italic>Lyonnais </italic>opened a Saint-Petersburg branch in 1878 and <italic>Gunzburg</italic> founded <italic>Discount Bank of Odessa</italic> with Greek <italic>Ralli</italic> and branches in Nikolaev and Bessarabian Chisinau in 1879. And as <italic>Russian & French Bank</italic> opened in 1880 with financing from investors including <italic>Anzin</italic>, <italic>Gunzburg</italic><italic>,</italic> and Polyakov affiliated railroad barons, the cousin of Maurice Hirsch and Rosa Rosenberg\u2019s husband Joseph Hirsch married a Polyakov. Likewise, Rosa Rosenberg\u2019s brother married a cousin of Moldovan Jassy banker<italic> </italic><italic>Neuschotz</italic>, who also kinterlinked with <italic>Vecsler</italic>.\nAlthough French banks with Jewish links entered Russia, American bankers had less success. While Russia selected Wharton Barker of Philadelphia\u2014grandson of early SBUS advocate Jacob Barker, nephew of <italic>Bethlehem Iron</italic>\u2019s Joseph Wharton, third great-grandson of Abraham Redwood, and cousin-in-law of Anthony Drexel\u2014as her financial agent in Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition and to construct four merchant cruisers in 1879, she continued to reject his proposals for industrial coal and iron concessions in Ukraine.\nFrom Britain through France to Germany, marriage drew bankers closer to the political class. Since Paule Heine of Hamburg married the Duke of Elchingen in 1866, Alice Heine of Bordeaux wed the Duke of Richelieu in 1875, a year after a daughter of the head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt married the Duke of Gramont. While the Duke of Gramont\u2019s mother was a Scottish aristocrat, his father\u2019s wife was a sister-in-law of Forbes since 1874. \nAfter the head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, Mayer Cohen-Barent Rothschild, died in 1874, so did his wife, a Katz-Samuel descendant, leaving their daughter, Hannah, as Britain\u2019s wealthiest heiress. In 1878, Hannah wed Foreign Undersecretary Neil Primrose of the House of Lords\u2014a descendant of Abel Smyth and 9th Earl of Argyll Archibald Campbell\u2014reinforcing banking and foreign policy interests to create a future PM. \nWhile aristocratic landowners faced cash shortages, banks often avoided unsecured or fast-turnaround loans. For discretion, speed, and flexible terms, they borrowed from moneylenders. Samuel Lewis was born in Birmingham. His father was imprisoned for debt in 1841 and later abandoned the family, leaving Lewis to support his mother by peddling jewelry. By 1869 he became a moneylender, serving clients including the 8th Duke of Beaufort and the 20th Earl of Shrewsbury, cousin-in-laws of <italic>Smyth</italic>, <italic>Coutts</italic>, and <italic>Campbell</italic>. \nThrough his wife\u2019s in-laws, Lewis was connected to Louis Jacobs, who a bookkeeper for <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. Although the family did not carry on the business after Lewis died in 1901\u2014and Britain delegalized usury\u2014Jacobs\u2019 sons Gordon founded stockbrokerage <italic>Jacobs</italic> to focus on merchant banks and mining finance houses in 1902 and his brother Ernest obtained a position at <italic>Rothchild</italic>\u2019s <italic>Alliance Assurance</italic>.\nWhile Christian Greeks and Armenians continued to dominate Turkish financial services, they lost influence to <italic>TURK</italic>. Since Turkey defaulted on her Russian war debts in the <italic>Panic of 1878</italic>, debts primarily held by <italic>TURK</italic> and local bankers. After the failures of Chiot cousin-in-laws <italic>Baltazzi</italic>, <italic>Ede</italic>, <italic>Hava</italic>, and <italic>Rodocanachi</italic> in 1881, Turkish financial reforms<italic> </italic>confined Armenians to small-scale banking and other intermediary roles. \nFollowing her debt default, the Ottoman Empire established the Public Debt Administration in 1881 to oversee foreign debt repayment and manage monopolies such as tobacco and salt, to attract foreign investment while maintaining some control over the economy. That year the Levantine Catholic banking heiress Aimee Glavany Crespin married Salim Malhame of Beirut. The Maronite Christian Malhame family of Lebanon descended from the pre-Islamic Arab Ghassanids of Tripoli known as warriors and merchants. Declining after military loss in 1711, the Malhame regained prominence during the economic expansion of Beirut in the 1830s. \nWhile Salim\u2019s father worked as an attorney, his mother Warda Jarwa descended from a Syrian Orthodox patriarch of Aleppo that united with Rome in 1783. Salim directed the Ottoman Public Debt from 1886 to 1895, served on the Board of <italic>TURK</italic>, managed Ottoman revenues, administered <italic>Syrian</italic> RR with BDF\u2019s Charles Goguel and <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Abraham Camondo, and represented <italic>Comptoir</italic> in Beirut. By the late 1880s, he became Director General in the Ottoman Ministry of Mines, Forests, & Agriculture, where he negotiated concessions, including the revival of Bursa\u2019s silk industry by taxing foreign competitors, lumber production in Albania, coal mining on the Black Sea coast, and banana plantations in Alanya.\nWhile <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier-</italic>allied <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> made a short-term loan to Egyptian Pasha Ismael in 1875, the Pasha defaulted in 1876, nearly wiping out<italic> Anglo-Egyptian</italic>. For a time, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna agent Julius Blum became Pasha until the Ottoman Sultan installed a son of the former pasha. <italic>Council of Foreign Bondholders</italic> sent G\u00f6schen and Henry Drummond Wolff to Egypt in to address the financial crisis, and <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> recovered, but Anglo-French forces occupied Egypt after Pasha Arabi revolted in 1882. \nBy 1883, Grey-in-law Evelyn Baring became Consul-General of Egypt. Other banker consulates included George Rosenthal for Portugal, Isaac Camondo for the Ottoman Empire, Gustave Rothschild for Austria, Eug\u00e8ne Pereire for Persia, Erlanger for Greece, and Eug\u00e8ne Oppenhym for South Africa.\nMeanwhile, low fuel prices increased competition and depressed investment. Amidst the crisis, German courts allowed cartels, but mostly disbanded soon after. In 1878, Russia allowed private individuals to buy state plants, transferring major factories in the Old Polish Basin to foreign capital. Soon after, <italic>Frankel</italic> acquired the steelworks. As German tariffs expired in 1877, German ironworks increasingly exported to Russia, which began subsidizing domestic industry. So, agricultural Junkers and federal railroads in Germany hiked tariffs, nationalized railroads, and formed a customs union with Austria in 1879. By 1879, the ironworks of Luxembourg and Lorraine formed possibly the first international cartel. \nSince Achille Fould\u2019s cousin married a Katz and Speyer cousin Palmyre Oulma in 1836, Palmyre\u2019s niece wed Alexandre Lazard in 1869. As BDF suspended convertibility after the<italic> Franco-Prussian War of 1870</italic> to repay indemnity, Alexandre Weill and Simon Lazard started <italic>Lazard</italic> London to maintain connection with Europe. This branch allowed <italic>Lazard</italic> to join <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s syndicate of thirty banks to replay reparations. As France refused to implement tariffs, her banks grew foreign direct investment. From 1875, <italic>Rothschild </italic>Paris invested in global assets, the family\u2019s only branch to do so due to national laws. \nAlthough mostly Christian, Christian did hire elite Jews. Born in Frankfurt, Emile Oulman, was an extended cousin of Jacob Schiff and his brother married into the Rothschild Sichel family in 1870. Starting at BBCI in 1873, he moved to <italic>Comptoir</italic> Brussels in 1875. Likewise, Count Joseph Cah\u00e9n\u2019s nephew Hermann Wallich joined <italic>Comptoir</italic> in 1863. By 1875, <italic>Comptoir</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> cofounded <italic>Indochine</italic> to develop French Southeast Asia. \nHaving co-founded <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, Swiss Huguenot \u00c9douard Hentsch led <italic>Comptoir</italic> from 1872 and became the first president of <italic>Indochine </italic>while his brother Ernest led <italic>Hentsch</italic> from 1879. As <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> invested into <italic>Indochine</italic> from 1881, <italic>Indochine </italic>branched to Hong Kong and beyond to become the French bank in China. Moreover Jewish bankers multiplied in France. From 45 Jews among the 300 money handlers in 1865, the figure grew to 100 out of 500 by 1881.<italic> </italic>\nBut transnational networks were not only Jewish. While <italic>Morton</italic> New York\u2019s Levi Morton, a third cousin of John Morgan\u2019s mother, served as honorary commissioner to the Paris Exhibition of 1878 and served in Congress from 1879 until becoming Ambassador to France in 1881, Grenfells joined John Rose at <italic>Morton</italic> London by the 1870s and served as directors at BOE and other banks.\nIn Belgium, <italic>Banque de l\u2019Union</italic>, <italic>Banque de Travaux Publics</italic>, and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel </italic>created <italic>Belgian Bank of Commerce & Industry</italic> (\u201cBBCI\u201d) in 1872. The following year, <italic>Banque des Travaux Publics</italic> retained Brussels-born Christian Valentin Briavoinne as a secretary. Within months, Briavoinne caught the attention of Emile Erlanger, who hired him as Managing Director of <italic>Franco-Austrian Bank</italic>. In July 1874, following Erlanger\u2019s appointment to the board of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>, Valentin was named deputy director. However, as the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> accelerated, <italic>Franco-Austrian Bank</italic> entered liquidation in 1875, with a claim against <italic>Erlanger</italic>. \nSince the bankruptcy of <italic>Banque de l\u2019Union</italic> in 1873, Simon Philippart acquired a majority of shares of her investment in BBCI and replaced the board with his representatives. That year, BBCI made advances to Philippart and bought securities tied to his railway. In 1874, BBCI, alongside <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> and <italic>Errera</italic> founded <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Tramways</italic>. By 1875, Philippart organized his holdings into a single company, controlling about 20 companies across Belgium, France, and Luxembourg.\nIn March 1875, Philippart launched a takeover of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> in 1874. As Briavoinne lost his position, <italic>Erlanger</italic> fought back. By April, Philippart\u2019s<italic> Banque Belge</italic> faced a crisis, driven by a sharp decline in stock prices and mounting financial strain, worsened by Briavoinne\u2019s escalating demands on <italic>Mobilier</italic> shares. By the end of the month, the banks associated with Briavoinne and Philippart struggled. \nAs <italic>Banque Belge</italic> suffered significant losses, Philippart was defeated in the battle for control. In response, Erlanger provided a large loan to <italic>Mobilier</italic> under stringent conditions, including management changes and the removal of Philippart. Taking a significant role in <italic>Mobilier</italic>\u2019s management, Erlanger reinstated Briavoinne as a Director by June 1875 <italic> </italic>and Managing Director in January 1876. After stabilizing the situation, Erlanger withdrew in 1876, and Count Hubert Delamarre became the new Chair of <italic>Mobilier</italic>. By then, most of Philippart\u2019s companies had gone bankrupt. Attempts to bail out <italic>Banque Belge</italic> failed, and it was declared bankrupt in late 1877.<italic> </italic><italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> failed the same year and Errera died shortly after.\nStarting with her Paris agency in 1877, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> liquidated many of the branch partnerships she formed less than a decade earlier. From 1870, her Bavarian representative Theodor Cramer-Klett\u2014a Lutheran owner of <italic>Maschinenfabrik</italic> <italic>Augsburg N\u00fcrnberg</italic> (\u201cMAN\u201d)\u2014helped found <italic>Merck</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Christian</italic> in Munich, <italic>Lotz Betcke</italic> in Kassel, and <italic>Scheibius</italic> in Milan. As <italic>Lotz</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Scheibius</italic> shuttered in 1879, <italic>Merck Christian</italic> took the name <italic>Merck</italic> <italic>Finck</italic>. In 1880, Cramer-Klett and <italic>Merck Finck</italic> founded <italic>Munich Reinsurance</italic> (\u201c<italic>Munich Re</italic>\u201d). \nSince <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna stabilized the Austrian government in the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> and Bleichr\u00f6der\u2019s coal road HC with Prince Henckel Donnersmarck did not suffer, a granddaughter of <italic>Disconto</italic>\u2019s David Hansemann\u2014whose other grandchildren descended from <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne\u2019s Salomon Oppenheim\u2014married Donnersmarck\u2019s ennobled cousin-in-law in 1876. \nLike Germany\u2014where courts allowed cartels after the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>\u2014Austria also sanctioned cartels. Since <italic>Witkowitz</italic>\u2014controlled by <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, <italic>Gutmann</italic>, and <italic>Wiener</italic>\u2014bought most of the Karl Wittgenstein\u2019s <italic>Teplice</italic> shares at half their nominal value by 1876. From 1877, Wittgenstein led a cartel between<italic> Teplice</italic> and <italic>Witkowitz</italic> for rail production, which became the foundation for Austria\u2019s first rail cartel in 1878. \nWhile Wittgenstein received funding from<italic> Bohemian Discount Bank</italic> to dominate northern Bohemia\u2019s lignite mining, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> wielded influence across multiple Czech Lands industries, including sugar, machine building, textiles, paper, and electro-technical sectors without cartels. By 1878 the Emperor ennobled the Gutmanns, but Wittgenstein\u2014and maybe Ignaz Petschek\u2014rejected ennoblement.\nWhile <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> and <italic>Disconto</italic> served as the chief state bankers in both parts of the Austro-Hungary, controlling the government bond market, they soon faced competition. Earlier, Isaac Pereire, <italic>Sina</italic>, L\u00e4mel- and Rothschild Beyfus-in-law <italic>Haber</italic>, <italic>Mallet</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, and other <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> investors founded <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Boden</italic><italic>c</italic><italic>redit</italic> to acquire Austrian estates like<italic> Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic>. Likewise, <italic>\u00d6sterreichische</italic> founded <italic>Wiener</italic>, an investment bank like <italic>Mobilier. </italic>In 1877, <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>and <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> secured a significant Austrian bond issue. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna quickly reasserted control, <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>bought the Prince of F\u00fcrstenberg\u2019s Silesian mines as he faced fierce competition from Wittgenstein in 1879.\nAbandoning plans for an independent Hungarian central bank, the Empire transformed <italic>Imperial </italic><italic>Austri</italic><italic>an</italic><italic> Bank</italic> into <italic>Imperial Austro-Hungarian Bank</italic> in 1878, merging central banking, transportation, and credit functions. <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic> was one of Hungary\u2019s few banks to withstand the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>. \nAs <italic>Creditbank</italic> became insolvent in 1878, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna investment more and promoted <italic>Creditbank</italic>\u2019s Prague chief Zsigmond Kornfeld\u2014formerly of <italic>Thorsch</italic>, a nephew of a Warburg Oppenheim, and grandnephew of one of the wealthiest Jews in central Bohemia\u2014to the Budapest headquarters, and to lead Hungary\u2019s first loan syndicate. By 1881, a cousin of the Hungarian noble Zichy family of Vienna\u2014who invested with Rothschild and in Galicia\u2014married August Sina Wimpffen, a noble Christian descendant of Katz, Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, Samson Wertheim, and Bernhard Eskeles. \nAfter restoring gold convertibly in 1878, France resumed construction of a quasi-public rail network with private banks circulating public railroad bonds. The largest of these banks was Paul Bontoux\u2019s <italic>Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>. With the exodus of Catholic Austrians from banking since the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, the Catholic Frenchman sought to compete with the remaining Jews and Catholics of Jewish descent. As the <italic>Treaty of Berlin</italic> split <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR<italic> </italic>across seven countries, Bontoux resigned from a <italic>Rothschild</italic> RR to found <italic>Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>in 1878. Other <italic>Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>projects ranged from water companies in Italy to Asturias mining railroads in Spain. In Austria, Bontoux partnered with <italic>Lyonnaise</italic> and Lyon\u2019s other Catholic brokers to rival <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna and other Jews. \nAmong the banks Bontoux co-founded was <italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic><italic>. </italic>With close ties to the Austrian government, <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> financed railways and industrial companies, such as <italic>Austrian-Alpine Mining Co</italic>, with significant interests across Southeast Europe. One of <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic>\u2019s early Jewish hires was Teomin Frankel Munk descendant Arnold Rappaport, who had worked as legal counsel for <italic>Galician Bank for Trade & Industry</italic> and was elected to the Galician Diet in 1876 and the Imperial Council in 1879. Likewise, Sigmund Popper Rosenfeld, born to a cousin thrice removed of Primator Joachim Popper in Upper Hungary, who had arrived in Vienna in the 1860s, joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, rose to authorized signatory. Marrying David Biedermann\u2019s granddaughter in 1870, he became second director of the newly founded <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic><italic> </italic>in 1880.\nSince<italic> \u00d6sterreichische Boden</italic><italic>c</italic><italic>redit</italic> and her<italic> Wiener</italic> affiliate bought the Prince of F\u00fcrstenberg\u2019s Silesian mines in 1879, Bontoux gained control of <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>by 1882 with credit from <italic>Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>. As <italic>Union </italic><italic>Bank of Vienna</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>invested in <italic>Hungarian Mortgage & Credit Bank </italic>under the leadership of a former Hungarian Finance Minister in 1881, Bontoux\u2019s <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> invested in <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, which was  affiliated with <italic>Creditbank </italic>through the Ulman family.\n<italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic> and <italic>Hungarian Mortgage & Credit Bank</italic> also joined <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, and <italic>Breslau Discount</italic> to found <italic>Nationalbank</italic>, at the initiative of Berlin private banker Jacob Lando, a Breslau-born Katz-descendant, to Austrian capital to German securities issuance and industrial financing that year. And since <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> cousin-in-law <italic>Pflaum </italic>financed railroads in Austria from 1868 and was instrumental in the founding of <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic> (1869) and <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Notenbank</italic> (1871). In 1881, <italic>Pflaum </italic>was reorganized as a joint-stock company, with shares held by <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> and <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic>. The following year, <italic>Pflaum</italic> helped form the first banking cartel agreement in Germany with <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic>. \n<italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> also extended into Serbia, where King Milan Obrenovi\u0107 chartered Mo\u0161e Mevorah\u2019s <italic>Royal Exchange</italic> in Belgrade. By 1880, Mevorah\u2019s daughter married fellow Sephardi Avram Amar. To export grain from Ma\u010dva, Mo\u0161e Mevorah\u2019s shop processed payments, and Avram Mevorah transported gold coins for payment, as grain was shipped on the Sava and Danube rivers. Within a decade, Mo\u0161e Mevorah helped launch Serbia\u2019s <italic>Royal Lottery</italic>. <italic>Serbian Credit Bank</italic>, Serbia\u2019s only foreign bank and primary monetary institution for nearly three decades, started with capital from <italic>Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> affiliated <italic>Vienna</italic> <italic>L\u00e4nderbank </italic>and <italic>Comptoir</italic>, alongside former Serbian Court Jew David Haim\u2019s grandson Abraham Ozerovi\u0107 in 1882. \nLikewise, David Haim\u2019s great-granddaughter married Edija Buli\u2019s son in 1876. Buli established the family\u2019s bank, developed by his son, Bencion, through trade. Along with serving as President of <italic>Savings Bank</italic>, he was a member of the first Discount Committee of <italic>Privileged National Bank</italic> from 1884 to 1887. He was also a member of the Tariff <italic>Committee of the Serbian State Railways</italic> and <italic>Commercial Court</italic>. Edija was also the first Jew appointed to the <italic>National Assembly</italic>, first by the decree of the prince (1881) and later by kings Milan (1885) and Alex Obrenovi\u0107 (1895). Later, he transferred his parliamentary powers to his brother David. \nWhile Count Jozef Russocki was a Deputy President of <italic>Galician Mortgage Credit Society</italic>, his extended cousin-in-law Count Wlodzimierz Borkowski was a <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic> director. In 1881, the Provincial Parliament of Galicia established <italic>Galician National Bank</italic> in Lemberg, centralizing financial control and replacing the fragmented system of local Jewish bankers. Led by Polish aristocrats, engaged in investment banking beyond mortgage credit. \nIn Boryslaw, at the time, most of over 200 oil and wax companies in Galicia were run by Jews, with exceptions being <italic>Galician </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic><italic> Bank</italic> and <italic>Co Commerciale Francaise</italic>, which acquired the small ventures. Likewise, <italic>Gartenberg</italic><italic> </italic>kinterlinked with Kolischers of <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic>. As <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> and <italic>Vienna</italic> <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> began acquiring oil fields in 1882, Stanistaw Szczepanowski, a Christian from German Posen, opened a refinery to refine Galician crude oil and produce lighting oil for transport to Bohemia and Moravia, with funding from <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Lemberg, <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic>, and<italic> </italic><italic>Galician Savings Bank</italic>, of which Count Russocki became President of at the same time as he was elected to lead <italic>Galician Mortgage Credit Society</italic>.\nAmidst volatile<italic> Union</italic> share prices, depositors ran from <italic>Lyonnais</italic>. Abandoning Bontoux,<italic> Lyonnais</italic>\u2019 Germain halted lending on <italic>Union</italic> shares. After Austria rejected Bontoux\u2019s bid, <italic>Union</italic> shares collapsed without aid from <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic>. To protect Lyon bankers, <italic>Rothschild</italic> led a privately funded bail-out, and Hirsch took over <italic>Union</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>rails (\u201c<italic>ORIENT</italic>\u201d). Amidst fraud charges in 1883, Bontoux fled France, blaming Jews and Huguenots.\n Since refusing to aid Bontoux\u2019s failing <italic>Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>L\u00e4nderbanki,</italic> <italic>Gutma</italic><italic>n</italic><italic>n</italic>, and Wittgenstein split the spoils. While <italic>Gutma</italic><italic>n</italic><italic>n</italic> and Wittgenstein incorporated the mines Bontoux bought from the Prince of F\u00fcrstenberg, <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> affiliated with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna to support Austrian\u2019s steel industry and the newly independent Balkans, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna integrated <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>into their group, and <italic>Deutsche Bank </italic>and<italic> Lyonnais </italic>invested in<italic> Wiener</italic>. \nThe <italic>Panic of 1882</italic> had lasting impacts on the Balkans. Also in 1882, <italic>Andrejevi</italic><italic>\u0107</italic> private bank formed in Belgrade and established ties with <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> focusing on tobacco trade and minting silver coins. By 1884, <italic>Berliner</italic> and <italic>Comptoir</italic> led an international consortium for a Serbian government loan with <italic>Vienna</italic> <italic>L\u00e4nderbank </italic>and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> funds. Since first opening branches in Bulgaria in the early 1870s, <italic>TURK</italic> expanded into mortgage credit from 1882. As <italic>TURK</italic> opened more branches, their operations surpassed <italic>Bulgarian National Bank</italic> by the late 1880s. Other attempts to establish banks with foreign capital failed until the 20th century. At the other extreme were landlocked Serbia and coal-poor Bulgaria. \nIn between the extremes of Bulgaria and Serbia, the Austrian Administration focused on railway building and export-based industries in Bosnia, bituminous coal discovery in 1884 spurred mining. Within two years, the government nationalized the mines, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris soon became a large shareholder in the mining monopoly. By 1888, Serbian, Muslim, and Jewish businessmen joined to start Bosnia\u2019s first autonomous bank, <italic>Narodna Banka</italic>. Additionally, Sarajevo saw the emergence of small private Jewish banking houses. \nBut while Christians criticized<italic> Rothschild</italic> Paris, the conservative Isaac Deutsch family competed with them in Hungary and served as the agent of Moravian rabbis in Vienna. So, Deutsch developed a large Hungarian flour mill and thrived as demand from Western Europe grew. Gaining price-fixing profits, Deutsch re-investing into land, railroads, and sugar via intermarriages. While his sister-in-law wed grain magnate Moritz Ulman\u2019s son in the 1850s, Deutsch\u2019s daughter married Samuel Brillin, a descendant of the Mandl Prefects of Hungary and rabbis of Moravia. \nThe Deutsch and Brillin family combined to buy a sugar refinery in 1881 and distilleries a year later with the Schossberger, before kinterlinking with the latter in 1888, and expanding sugar operations together. Along with the Ulmans and other cousins, they controlled a quarter of sugar, comprised over 60% of the highest taxpayer class, and split Hungarian banking as a Deutsch joined the Board of <italic>Imperial Austro-Hungarian Bank</italic> after the central bank reformed in 1878. \nInvolved in crop trading, railroad financing, landownership, and private banking, the Schossbergers, became the first Jewish family since the Middle Ages to acquire Hungarian nobility without conversion in 1863. By then, they kinterlinked with the Mayers  in 1851. After trading textiles for <italic>Biedermann Wertheim</italic>, Philipp Mayer of Bohemia started a Vienna printing business and married a Schlesinger by 1815. In 1832, Mayer\u2019s granddaughter wed her Schlesinger cousin, Wilhelm Boschan, in Vienna\u2014a descendant of the Teomin Frankel Munk Mint Jews of Vienna related to the Auerbach and Katz Luria families. \nWhile some converted or married Christians, others remained and married Jews. In 1841, Friedrich Boschan married Franziska Porges Epstyn in Prague, and in 1844, Pauline\u2019s sister married Philipp Baumgarten in Vienna. Since Philipp\u2019s uncle, Israel, married a sister\u2010in\u2010law of Antoinette Neuwelt in 1810, her relative Hermann Neuwelt married Babette Munk in Pest in 1852. Also, that year, Franziska Porges Epstyn\u2019s brother wed Elisabeth Morpurgo in Trieste, and Mayer\u2019s grandson married Leonore Kaulla in Vienna. In 1857, Mayer\u2019s granddaughter married <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Pest\u2019s Friedrich Semler, a descendant of the Pressburgers and the Mandl Prefects of Hungary, in Vienna, and in 1872, Franziska Porges Epstyn\u2019s cousin married Justine Munk Neuwelt in Pest. \nWhile one Mayer sister married a Boschen, another Mayer sister married Bohemian-born Simon Hirsch in Vienna. Simon\u2019s brother wed a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and their sister married a Springer-in-law of the Boschens, whose grandson was Guido Elbogen. By 1866, Elbogen joined <italic>Oppenhym Alberti</italic> in Paris and participated in the firm\u2019s Egyptian and Romanian operations until 1870, when he moved to Vienna to work for the Springers until, in 1877 he was elected to <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>\u2019s board.\nFrom W\u00fcrttemberg, Philipp Baumgarten\u2019s grandfather settled in Fej\u00e9r, Hungary, a junction for merchants of Vienna, Zagreb, Transdanubia, and Transylvania, in the 18th century, the Baumgartens traded grain and wool, became large <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> shareholders, and then landholders. Through his second wife, Baumgarten\u2019s daughter married Bernhard Popper. \nBorn a cattle trader outside of Pressburg in Moravian Hungary of unknown relation to Bohemian Primator Joachim Popper, he began his career at Vienna bank<italic> Sichel Morpurgo</italic><italic>, </italic>which failed in the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, and joined <italic>Wiener</italic> in 1875. A year after he became Procurator in 1880, he married Baumgarten\u2019s daughter. In between Popper becoming Deputy Director in 1885, and Director in 1893, Baumgarten\u2019s nephew wed a Batonyi, who\u2019s uncle married Adolf Ulman\u2019s sister. By 1908, Popper became Chair of <italic>Wiener</italic>. \nBy then, a Porges Boschan heiress married Richard Wertheim Lieben, a descendant of Samson Wertheim and Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe. Richard\u2019s uncle Jakob Lieben was instrumental in founding <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, serving as a director until his death in 1887. After marrying a K\u00f6nigswarter, Jakob\u2019s children kinterlinked with Wertheim K\u00f6nigswarter, Kulp, Speyer, and Kaulla heirs. While Richard became a VP of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, his brother Leo served as a director of <italic>Imperial Austro-Hungarian Bank</italic> and <italic>Vienna Stock Exchange</italic>. \nSince Jakob\u2019s brother Ignaz\u2014Richard and Leo\u2019s father\u2014partnered with his aunt\u2019s husband\u2014and his third cousin twice removed through descendants of Court Jews Elias Gomperz, Samson Wertheim, and Samuel Oppenheim\u2014Samuel Auspitz as textile merchant bankers. Auspitz\u2019s daughter married their cousin Max Auspitz Gomperz, a Moravian wholesale heir who joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s board in 1860 and was elected President in 1895, Likewise, Max\u2019s niece married Leo.\nRelated to the K\u00f6nigswarters through his L\u00e4mel mother, Gustav Mauthner\u2019s father was a Bohemian textile manufacturer who descended from Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and was an in-law of the Porges. Mauthner had joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> in 1869, but left to join his brother at <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>\u2019s <italic>Austrian General Bank</italic>, before returning after that bank collapsed in the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>. He became a director in 1880, a year after marrying the daughter of Carl Wei\u00df. \nDescendants of Sephardi exiles from Spain and Vienna, the Bachrach Wei\u00df brothers moved from Bohemia in the first half of the 19th century to Verona and Milan, establishing cloth and silk businesses. After liquidating that business, several brothers ran the banking house <italic>Wei\u00df</italic> in Milan and Vienna, while Carl Wei\u00df joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s management in 1866, became Chair in 1886, resigned in 1888, and later served as President.\nPossibly related to Bernhard Popper and Joachim Popper, Leo Popper was born near Nagybics\u00e9, Hungary, and began his career as a timber and products trader in the 1840s. Following Hungary\u2019s revolt in 1848, Popper ventured into forestry, floating timber down the V\u00e1h and Danube Rivers to Budapest. His success led him to establish a steam sawmill in Nagybics\u00e9 and expand into Bukovina and Galicia, where he built a large sawmill and settlement. Dominating the timber market in Upper Hungary and Galicia, Popper supplied timber for <italic>Suez Canal</italic>. In 1877, Popper\u2019s daughters married members of the Biedermann and Kayn-Speyer families. By 1882, he became the first Jew ennobled in Hungary.\nKayn-Speyer\u2019s father Simon descended from a long-established Kohanim family of Frankfurt with connections with the Rothschilds from the 17th century, he married Julie Flersheim Speyer, a descendant of Michael Speyer, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, and Samson Wertheim, and hyphenated their surnames. Julie\u2019s sister Fanny married French banker Antonine Stern of the Frankfurt family, and, in 1855, their daughter married Georges Halphen, whose son Emile married Louise Fould in 1883.  \nBy then the daughter of Simon and Julie married Sigmund Rietzes in 1871. From a Lemberg family originated in Brody, Rietzes moved to Vienna and founded <italic>Reitzes</italic> bank with his brother that year. After the <italic>Panic</italic><italic> of 1873</italic>, <italic>Reitzes</italic> acquired shares in the <italic>Aussig</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Teplitz</italic>, <italic>Dux</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Bodenbach</italic>, <italic>Graz</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>K\u00f6flach</italic>, and other railways. Purchasing control of <italic>Wiener Pferdetramway</italic> in 1879, <italic>Reitzes</italic>, in association with <italic>Union </italic><italic>Bank of Vienna</italic>, acquired <italic>Bohemian Northern</italic> RR shares from the stat in 1882.\nMoreover, Austrian courts judged cases involving Jews on the merits. Growing under the management of under Katz-cousin Victor Offenheim\u2014a relative of Arnstein, Herz, and Johann and Esther Liebman, Goldschmidt, Gomperz, and Schiff\u2014since 1864, <italic>Lemberg</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Czernowitz</italic> RR suffered during the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic> and abandoned the Lemberg to Odessa line. While extending to Brody and Tarnopol by 1869 and from Suczawa in Bukovina to <italic>Moldovan</italic> RR and Jassy in 1870, <italic>Lemberg</italic>-<italic>Czernowitz</italic> RR faced profitability disputes. As <italic>Galician Credit Bank</italic>\u2019s Prince Adam Sapieha sued Offenheim, a Vienna trial lasted for two years until Offenheim\u2019s acquittal in 1875 revealed extortion by government officials, including the Minister of Trade, prompting Sapieha\u2019s resignation.\nWhile Jewish landownership spread across Austrian Poland since Galicia allowed Jews to own land in 1867, Galician Jews in Vienna lived on the social margins, working low-paying jobs and relying on charity while facing prejudice from both non-Jews and assimilated Jews. Only a handful, mostly from wealthy rabbinical families, achieved major success in Vienna.\nThe percentage of Jewish female entrepreneurs grew in Russian industry, particularly in smaller Jewish businesses and trade, in the <italic>Pale of Settlement</italic>, where women ran shops, and others engaged in the alcohol trade and innkeeping. Around 1879, Sophia Brodsky, was the one of the few Jewish female entrepreneurs operating outside the <italic>Pale</italic>, owning a tobacco factory in Voronezh with 20 employees. By 1881, a Katz-descendant Brodsky sugar heir of Russia married a Galician Mises Bernstein, whose uncle had ran <italic>Creditanstalt</italic><italic> </italic>Lemberg.\nDespite the wealth of West European Jewry, most of their co-religionists lived in Russia and Romania in oppressive poverty. Since Tsar Alex II the progressive Liberator who had initiated reforms in Russia and was about to introduce constitutional changes was assassinated by the socialist <italic>People\u2019s Will</italic> in 1881 after several failed attempts. As antisemitic rural clerics identify their Jewish neighbors as scapegoats, mobs violently seized property and displaced Jewish communities. After initial inactivity, the Russian Minister of the Interior sanctioned the pogroms by imposing discriminatory new laws that further limited the Jews\u2019 freedom of movement and work. \nAntisemitic conspiracies spread virally. In April 1882, Eszter Solymosi, a 14-year-old Catholic servant girl disappeared from Tiszaeszl\u00e1r, Hungary. After Eszter\u2019s mother accused local Jews, investigators coerced Jozsef Scharf\u2019s 5-year-old son into claiming that Eszter had been killed in a synagogue by several Jewish men. Though he recanted the confession, the synagogue was locked, and there were no traces of the body or blood, the investigating judge arrested Scharf, his wife, and twelve Jews. Scharf was also imprisoned and terrorized. \nWhile a girl\u2019s body washed ashore and was recognized by the local doctor as Eszter, her mother refused to identify the body. Despite the lack of credible proof and the contradiction in testimonies, the case gained national attention, with antisemitic pamphlets and political agitation escalating. After lengthy legal proceedings that debunked the allegations, the accused Jews were acquitted in 1883, exposing the falsehoods and misconduct of the investigation.\nAs Russian stock prices collapsed, <italic>Ephrussi </italic>threatened to flood the market with grain, but to no avail. Kinterlinks accelerated. Opening offices in Vienna and Paris as Jews fled Russia, Maurice Ephrussi married Beatrice, the daughter of Alphonse, head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and BDF Regent, allying the two houses, and investing in Baku oil. From 1883, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris transported Caspian oil using <italic>Baku-Batum</italic> RR to Deutsch-Meurthe\u2019s refineries in France, Spain, and Austrian Fiume. As Marc Gunzburg Rosenberg married Mathilde Rosenberg Warburg in 1882, Yakov Polyakov\u2019s daughter wed Warsaw banker Wilhelm Lando\u2019s son, and Saint-Paul of Paris two years later. \nArtur Levinsohn Rafalovich left Odessa to join his father Herman in Paris and wed a Wertheim of Frankfurt by 1883 and Gunzburgs kinterlinked with Joseph Sassoon in 1884<italic> </italic>and Ludwig Gutmann\u2014Viennese banker and co-owner with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna of <italic>Witkowitz </italic>iron and coal works of Galicia\u2014in 1888. While Ludwig Gutmann\u2019s sister married the brother of<italic> Louis-</italic><italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic><italic>\u2019 </italic>Leo Dreyfu\u00df in 1886, Joseph Sassoon\u2019s sister Rachel married Frederick Beer in 1887. Descended from Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, Frederick\u2019s father had moved from Frankfurt to London, where he invested in railroads, telegraphs, and the <italic>Observer</italic> newspaper. By the 1890s, Rachel became Britain\u2019s first woman to own and edit two national newspapers, <italic>Sunday Times</italic> and <italic>Observer</italic>. Also in 1887, Joseph and Rachel\u2019s cousin Edward Sassoon wed a French Rothschild. \nFollowing ill-fated speculations in Russian <italic>rubles</italic> in 1883, <italic>Berliner </italic>hired Carl F\u00fcrstenberg, which he led into a new era. Born a Jew in Danzig in 1850, F\u00fcrstenberg financed Berlin cotton before joining <italic>Disconto</italic>, and then <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> in 1872, where he became Gerson Bleichr\u00f6der\u2019s preferred associate. F\u00fcrstenberg soon built <italic>Berliner</italic> into Germany\u2019s main Russian railway bond house, sometimes for <italic>Polyakov</italic>. While Rothschild financed most Russian debt since the 1860s, pogroms led <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic>, <italic>Becker Fuld</italic>, and other bankers to refuse to market Russian bonds. But other bankers took up the loan, including <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Lippma</italic><italic>n</italic><italic>n Rosenthal</italic>, and Herman Rafalovich, who joined <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s board in 1885 after his son wed a Wertheim of Frankfurt. \nDespite the boycott on Russian securities, Dutch Jewish brokers continued to thrive. When Max Warburg of Hamburg sought a half-year training in 1888, he chose <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic>. Of unknown relation to <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic>, Amsterdam-born Julius Wertheim Gans established <italic>Gans</italic> in 1883. The stock brokerage acted as an agent for <italic>Huilier</italic> of Paris and <italic>Pinto Oppenh</italic><italic>y</italic><italic>m</italic> of London, trading primarily in foreign assets, Dutch state bonds, and shares in shipping and East-Indies companies. From 1889, <italic>Gans</italic> transformed into <italic>Mendes Gans</italic> by partnering with Isaac Cah\u00e9n Mendes. Connected to DaCosta and Teixeira on his father\u2019s side, Mendes\u2019 mother was a niece of Joseph Cah\u00e9n, and so a cousin of the Bischoffsheim, Camondo, Morpurgo, Reinach, Rothschild, and Warshavsky families. \nLikewise, Russian Jews continued to thrive despite antisemitic Russian securities. Notable examples include Jews owning substantial shares in joint-stock sugar companies, tanneries, sawmills, and grain export from Odessa. In Saint-Petersburg and the northwest, Jews constituted a significant portion of the mercantile class. Despite calls for reform, opposition hindered social reforms. Disputes over bad goods and theft now turned violent.\nAmidst the breakdown in payments and commerce, Morozov called for police to protect Jews in the <italic>Pale</italic> while his associates sought to expel Jews from Moscow. Instead, Russia\u2019s paternalistic autocracy made concessions to different social groups. To address worker unrest, influenced by Bismarckian Germany\u2019s social policy, the government introduced laws to restrict child labor and abuse from 1882. Likewise, Nikolai Bungi became Deputy Minister of Finance in 1880, and then Minister of Finance in 1881 until 1886. \nBorn in Kyiv to Lutheran of East Prussians possibly related to the Bunge family, Bungi family were related to the Baltic Lutherans who benefited from decades of religious emancipation and Russia anti-free market railroad investment following the Polish <italic>Uprising of 1863</italic>. Likewise, Bungi cousins kinterlinked with <italic>Sieglitz</italic>. After graduating with a law degree in 1845, Nikolai was appointed teacher of laws of state administration. Bungi served as rector of <italic>Kiew</italic><italic> Uni</italic> from 1859, when he joined the financial commission for peasant reform. Leaving his academic post in 1862, he managed <italic>Imperial State Bank</italic> Kiew and turned Tsar Nicholas.\nAs Jewish bankers boycotted Russia due to antisemitic laws since 1882, Bungi supported other social groups by helping create <italic>Peasant Bank</italic> in 1883 for to parcel mortgaged estates to Russian colonists and the abolition of the poll-tax in 1885. Against Polyakov\u2019s <italic>Moscow</italic> <italic>Land Bank</italic>, <italic>Noble Bank </italic>became a state bank in 1885, and<italic> </italic>offered low rates for nobles with promise of a greater role in military and local governance, and courts. Along with <italic>Imperial State Bank</italic>, and <italic>Noble</italic> soon spread across the Empire. Bungi also issued rules for urban and private banks in 1883. With the growth of state credit, Jewish private bankers no longer played the central role in Russian imperial finance that they had held since the 1860s. \nLikewise, reforms spread to Old Believers around Moscow. By 1883, Russia removed more restrictions on Old Believer, who could now occupy public positions, obtain passports, conduct public religious services, and build and repair houses of worship. As textile industrialists led Moscow\u2019s Old Believer banks, bankers led Jewish banks in Saint-Petersburg and in the <italic>Pale</italic>. While the former established industries eschewed speculation for stability, the latter embraced a dynamic, speculative <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic><italic></italic><italic></italic><italic></italic>-like approach. This divergence mirrored Moscow\u2019s solidity. \nAfter Timofei Morozov died in 1889, his wife Maria became head of <italic>Morozov</italic> and <italic>Nikolskaia Manufactory</italic>, modernizing with electricity and expanding exports. That year, Russian Orthodox Grigori Eliseev made his son Alex partner at <italic>Eliseev</italic>. As Alex became <italic>Saint-Petersburg Private Commercial Bank</italic> chair, he rose to Commercial Counsellor by 1885 and held diverse positions within <italic>Demidov </italic>and the <italic>Ministry of Finance</italic>, <italic>Ministry of Trade & Industry</italic>, and <italic>Ministry of Internal Affairs</italic>.\nLike Anna Rosenberg convinced her husband Horace Gunzberg to create a Jewish orphanage in 1881, Clara Bischoffsheim convinced her husband Maurice Hirsch to fund Jewish<italic> </italic>emigration to the Americas and Syrian Palestine<italic> </italic>to colonize a safe land, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and other Jewish bankers refused to buy Russian debt for a decade. Following the death of his only son from tuberculosis in 1887, Maurice Hirsch re-focused on charity for Russian Jews, while his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ernest Cassel ran the business. \nWhile Polyakov had built a college, students protested rather than thank a Jew. As he donated to Jewish causes, his brother became the Russian head of Hirsch\u2019s colonization venture. <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris also diversified mining across Spain, France, and their colonies, establishing <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic> (1881)\u2014for lead and oil\u2014, <italic>Nickel</italic> (1883), and Mexican copper miner <italic>Boleo</italic> (1885), with <italic>Cah\u00e9n</italic>, <italic>Mirabaud</italic>, <italic>Wendel</italic>, and others French investors and industrialists. Since Bischoffsheim and Pereire joined <italic>Royal Asturian Mines Co</italic> of Spain in 1853, the company grew through acquisition until 1885, when they monopolized regional zinc extraction and production with the purchase of Santander\u2019s mines. \nUnlike Rosalia Vydrin Polyakov and earlier generations, her daughters and other third generation Polyakov women did not engage in commerce. Despite his waning religiosity, <italic>Commercial Bank of Minsk</italic>\u2019s Vice Director Chonon Wengeroff did not allow his wife, the granddaughter of Luria descendant Simeon Epstein, to engage in banking, even though her Gunzburg and Zak in-laws propelled his career. \nSince Russian law did not allow mixed religion marriages, Polyakovs turned to salons to build bridges with Christians. However, unlike the Jewish salons in Old Regime Berlin that included both Jewish and Christian attendees, late 19th century Russian literary salons developed culture instead of bridges. As another daughter of the head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt married the Duke of Wagran in 1882, the widowed Paule and Alice Heine married the Duke of Rivoli and Prince Albert of Monaco in 1886 and 1889. By 1890, a Rothschild Franchetti married a noble Fugger descendant.\nAlong with Russian antisemitism, Prussian Friedrich Raiffeisen developed cooperative banking to provide credit to Christian farmers and craftsmen, specifically excluding Jews. <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> banks spread rapidly beyond, and by the early 1870s, the first regional cooperative credit union was established. Unlike \u201cunrestrained\u201d and Jewish capitalism or state-run socialist bank, private regional auditing clearinghouses oversaw the cooperatives. Strangling Jewish borrowers and lenders, cooperatives spread into Austrian Galicia, Slovenia, and beyond. \nBuying small Jewish-owned wax companies of Galician Boryslaw in competition with <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic>, <italic>Co Commerciale Francaise</italic> only employed Christian workers, contributing to complex financial disputes managed by Jewish overseers. A debt disagreement in 1884, escalated into conflict among workers, requiring police intervention. Within a day, the French company\u2019s workers attacked Jewish homes, damaging private and religious property.\nThe same year, <italic>Bergheim MacGarvey</italic> began  exploring, drilling, and refining Galician oil. Born in Canada to Irish immigrants, William MacGarvey began drilling in Wyoming, Ontario, and by the 1860s worked as a coal mine entrepreneur. He married Helena Wesolowska, a cousin-in-law of the noble founders of <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic>, and in 1881 moved to Hanover, Germany, to manage drilling. There he partnered with John Bergheim, an engineer and banker, later joined by the marriage of their children.\nBy 1886, new Galician oil and wax regulations granted permission for sinking shaft only under strict conditions enacted. As the number of wells declined, the Jewish population grew but no longer occupied important roles. Likewise, Sloboda Rungurska had 300 wells with an output of 75,000 tons annually. Long connected with <italic>Galician </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic><italic> Bank</italic>, Stanistaw Szczepanowski formed a consortium to build a railway branch from Kolomea to the oil fields, financed by <italic>Biederma</italic><italic>m</italic><italic>n</italic> of Vienna. By the 1890s, distilleries appeared in Galicia, including one owned by Szczepanowski in Kolomea.\nIn Galicia, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna employed <italic>Horowitz</italic>. While Katz-descendant Horowitz started the second largest bank in Lemberg, with his Katz-descendant Ashkenasy wife, a cousin of the Chief Rabbi of British Ashkenazi Hirschel Levi and Odessa\u2019s grain trader and in-law of <italic>Rafalovich</italic> and <italic>Ephrussi</italic>. Horowitz\u2019s cousins, fellow Katz-descendant Kallir co-founded<italic> </italic>Galicia\u2019s largest private bank,<italic> Nathansohn Kallir</italic>, with Landau cousins, which evolved into <italic>Nirenstein Kallir</italic> with the second-generation kinterlinking with the Nirenstein, Halberstam, and Mises cousins. In early 1884, a Kallir married Wertheim cousin-in-law Ignaz, son of Bohemian soft coal magnate, Jewish Levite Moses Petschek. After Kallir\u2019s banking line ended with the death of Nathan in 1886, the family dissolved the Brody bank in 1887, and all activities moved to Vienna.\nSince Russia effectively closed <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland </italic>by 1885, <italic>Bank Handlowy</italic> became Poland\u2019s largest financial institution, and branched to across Austrian, German, and Russian Poland, first to Tschenstochau, Lublin, Lodz, Kalisch, and Sosnowitz, followed by B\u0119dzin, Kiew, Radom, Leslau, and Zawiercie in the 1890s. While Katz-Louri\u00e9 founded <italic>Mutual Credit Society of Pinsk </italic>with their rabbinical cousin Rabinowitz directors and Luria descendant and Katz-husband Rabbi Borukh Epstein as the bookkeeper, Katz-Eskenasi and many others established Grodno\u2019s <italic>Private Mutual Credit Society</italic> in Belarus on the border with the states of Lithuania and Poland. \nAs America\u2019s Congress enacted the <italic>Interstate Act of 1887</italic> (\u201cIA1887\u201d) to eliminate ruinous railroad and transport competition by delegalizing private pooling and stabilizing cartel rates by policing cheats, a regional German court opined on the country\u2019s preference for industry cooperation to achieve planned and orderly development, emphasizing the community\u2019s interest in preventing prices from falling below production costs. But as miners struck in in 1889, German Kaiser Wilhelm II shifted from Bismarck\u2019s oppressive social policies to supporting labor reforms, including cartels and limiting child and female employment. As BOE and GRB raised rates in 1889, the international conference in 1890 advocated global labor standards, coinciding with a coal miners\u2019 strike in Britain involving 260,000, disrupting industry due to coal shortages. \nSince the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Jews consolidated coal assets. Founded in the 1864 by the son of a doctor in Dresden, <italic>Arnhold</italic> bank kinterlinked with Warburg cousins DelBanco and Wertheim cousins descended from the Mint Jew of Schwerin. In 1882, Upper Silesian industrialist Oskar Huldschinsky married Ida Brandeis, a cousin-in-law of the Goldschmidt, Landauer Schey, and Porges families. Inheriting his indebted family coal mining firm in Upper Silesia in 1880, Fritz Friedl\u00e4nder acquired competitors. After joining with <italic>Deutsche</italic> to establish <italic>Association of Upper Silesian Coal Producers</italic> to facilitate price agreements and <italic>Upper</italic> <italic>Silesian Coke Works & Chemical Factories</italic> to introduce the coke industry to the region in 1890, Friedl\u00e4nder wed Milly Fuld of Rothschild\u2019s old Amsterdam agent, <italic>Becker Fuld</italic>. And, as coal demand continued to fall, <italic>Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate</italic> followed the model to cartelize coal in the Ruhr without laying off miners. \n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Early American Panics & Big Business II</italic>\nAfter partnering with Schiff- and Rothschild cousin Adolph Rindskopf of Frankfurt to form <italic>Kuhn Rindskopf</italic> textiles in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1850, Abraham Kuhn partnered with a descendant of the Alsatian Katz Wahls, Jacob Netter to form <italic>Kuhn Netter</italic>. As Kuhn\u2019s sister Fanny married Abraham Loeb in 1852, Loeb joined <italic>Kuhn Netter</italic>. Tragically, Fanny passed away shortly after childbirth, prompting Loeb to marry Betty Gallenberg of Mannheim. \nBy then, <italic>Kuhn Netter</italic> business thrived. Becoming wealthy after supplying the Union, <italic>Kuhn Netter</italic> transitioned from textiles to banking. While Samuel Kuhn, Jacob Netter, and an in-law opened a private bank in Cincinnati, Abraham Kuhn, Loeb, and his cousin Samuel Wolff founded <italic>Kuhn Loeb</italic> (\u201c<italic>Kuhn</italic>\u201d) in New York by 1867 and kinterlinked with other German Jews. \nSince David Schiff became the Chief Rabbi of London from 1765, his grand-nephew Nathan Adler of Frankfurt, was elected in 1845. While his paternal grandmother was David Schiff\u2019s sister, Nathan\u2019s maternal grandfather was the Katz Wahl descendant Chief Rabbi of Hanau. By 1830, Nathan wed Rothschild-in-law d\u2019Worms and became the Chief Rabbi of Hanover. As Nathan\u2019s brother married a Katz and became a Chief Rabbi of Schwarzwald and sister married Jacob Budge, related to a Protected Jew of Wetzlar. Another brother married a d\u2019Worms, and their daughter married Frankfurt banker Moritz Budge. Nathan Adler\u2019s nephews (and grandsons of David Schiff), married the daughters of David Schiff\u2019s second cousin, Jacob-Hirsch Schiff.\nWhile Jacob-Hirsch\u2019s mother was a Katz-cousin, his son Moses married a granddaughter of a Katz-cousin Speyer. Moses was a stockbroker in Frankfurt, but his son Jacob sought to move to New York. After family connections helped him gain experience with <italic>Speyer</italic> New York and the new bank of Adolph Goldschmidt Gans from 1865, Jacob Schiff partnered with a son of a Katz-descendant broker from Frankfurt, Moritz Budge\u2019s son Henry, to form in 1867 to form <italic>Budge Schiff, </italic>and trade stocks, <italic>dollars</italic>, and gold. Trading successfully with <italic>Morgan</italic> <italic>Dabney, Cooke, </italic>and other bankers, <italic>Budge Schiff</italic> failed when <italic>Schepeler</italic> New York defaulted in the <italic>Panic of 1869</italic>.\nMarcus Goldman, son of a cattle dealer, and Joseph Sachs, son of a saddle maker, had studied in the same synagogue in Bavarian W\u00fcrzburg. After Joseph fled to America with the daughter of a wealthy goldsmith from her disapproving parents in 1847, Marcus Goldman arrived in Baltimore in 1848, and peddled in Pennsylvania before opening a clothing store in Philadelphia. As his wife disliked the city, Goldman maintained his clothing partnership and moved to New York in 1869 and co-founded <italic>Putzel</italic> <italic>Goldman</italic> with Mayer Putzel.\nAn experienced Philadelphia note broker dealing in promissory notes\u2014precursors to commercial paper (\u201cCP\u201d)\u2014Putzel kinterlinked with a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim the year before. However, the partnership ended within a year and Goldman established <italic>Goldman</italic> in 1870. He provided cash to diamond and leather merchants in return for CP repayment that he sold to <italic>Chemical</italic> NB, <italic>Importers & Traders</italic> NB, or <italic>Citi </italic>NB. By 1870, Goldman\u2019s daughter wed Ludwig Gallenberg, a cousin-in-law of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Solomon Loeb.\nMeanwhile, Ernest Cassel of Cologne, a relative of Bischoffsheim cousin Germain Cassel, apprenticed at <italic>Eltzbach</italic><italic>er</italic>, who had married a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim and a relative of Cassel\u2019s uncle-in-law. Soon after beginning a clerkship with <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> in Paris in 1870, he fled as the <italic>Franco-Prussian War </italic>made his German heritage a liability. He joined <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> and, after the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, set out to sell in American railroads when he met Jacob Schiff. \nSince Paul Schiff of Oder\u2014and unknown relation to the Frankfurt Schiffs\u2014joined <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Manchester and Hamburg agent<italic> Behrens</italic> in 1853, he kinterlinked with <italic>Warburg</italic>. After <italic>Warburg</italic> hosted Isaac Dreyfu\u00df of <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel and Frankfurt as an apprentice, his sister married Jacob Schiff\u2019s brother in 1870. As Jacob Schiff considered joining <italic>Warburg</italic> and managing their new <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, Abraham Kuhn, who settled in Frankfurt by then, convinced Schiff to join <italic>Kuhn</italic> as partner in 1874\u2014the same year as Loeb\u2019s cousins Abraham Wolff and Michael Gernsheim joined\u2014and marrying Loeb\u2019s daughter a year later. (Schiff also associated with his old partner Budge.) \nOn Jacob Schiff\u2019s 1873 advice, <italic>Paribas</italic> and Cassel explored investing again since Mexico rebelled against France and <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America </italic>established British dominance. From then, Schiff was the New York agent of Cassel and <italic>Paribas</italic>.  By 1875, Abraham Kuhn\u2019s daughter wed a Katz-cousin descended from Court Jews Lipman Cohen-Behrens, Johann Liebman, Joseph Goldschmid, Samson Wertheim, and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, and so an extended cousin of Rothschild and K\u00f6nigswarter. Within a year, Warburg and Rindskopf cousins married one another in Hamburg.\nAfter Cassel married Annette Maxwell in 1878, he became a naturalized citizen and soon adopted his wife\u2019s Catholicism. While they had one daughter, Amalia, Annette died in 1881 and Cassel never remarried or seriously practiced Catholicism. He soon became a close friend of Britain\u2019s Crown Prince, he worked with <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Hirsch</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic>. <italic>Kuhn</italic> soon also made Episcopalian-convert Otto Kahn partner. Sired by a Kohanim banker father, Kahn was related to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> through his Eberstadt mother. \nHis maternal grandfather was the Mayor of Worms Ferdinand Gernsheim Eberstadt, when he helped Solomon Loeb obtain a permit to immigrate to America. While the mayor\u2019s great-grandfather had married an Oppenheim of unknown lineage, his cousin was the last Jewish Bishop of Worms and founded leather business <italic>Gernsheim</italic> in 1768. Loeb, in partnership with his brother-in-law Abraham Kuhn, established a dry goods business in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1867 that became <italic>Kuhn</italic>. The Mannheim-born Kahn was already related to <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> London and <italic>Speyer</italic> before marrying the daughter of <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Abraham Wolff. \nDespite Jewish advances in banking since Napoleon, Prussia and other German states continued to limit Jewish access into law and other academia until the end of the 19th century due to religious and ethnic prejudices. Unlike in East-Central Europe, White Christians dominated American wealth. Like religion, early law focused on public oration. Discrimination ensured that American law firms\u2014at least those large enough to handle corporate matters\u2014and Court justices were White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant men. While <italic>Morgan</italic> partnered with firms around the country, <italic>OIL</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic> partnered with select New York firms. Both firms centralized family partners management without branches.\nSince helping found the Republican party and organizing <italic>Blatchford Seward</italic> law firm with his in-law, William Seward became Lincoln\u2019s Secretary of State and orchestrated the purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867. While the transaction was ridiculed, the growing <italic>Blatchford Seward</italic> hired a patent railroad lawyer associated with Alex Hamilton Jr, converted Mendes descendant Charles DaCosta in 1868, and soon became <italic>Blatchford </italic><italic>Seward DaCosta</italic>. \n<italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Seligman</italic>, and <italic>Hallgarten</italic> continued to retain only this law firm\u2019s services from the 1870s, through name changes into <italic>Cravath</italic>, for another century. <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>OIL</italic> depended on Philadelphia lawyer John Johnson for most property Court cases. Since rejecting an appointment to the Court in 1881, Johnson made a fortune alongside Morgan and Rockefeller through WWI. \nOut of Switzerland, the Guggenheim and Levinger families continued to inter-marry to bridge separation with Bavarian and American cousins. In the mid-1850s, Bavarian Adolf Levinger built his law practice within the German-American community, leveraging his involvement with the Republican Party to expand his network. By 1865, he gained clients\u2019 trust, particularly German-American brewers and bankers through his opposition to excise measures, and was elected to the New York State Assembly, particularly attracting. \nIn 1871, Levinger expanded his law firm by partnering with his cousin Randolph Guggenheimer and opening a second office specializing in real estate. (The Viriginia-born Guggenheimer\u2019s father migrated from Bavaria, with likely but unknown relation to the Guggenheims.) That year, Republican Levinger and other German lawyers of New York campaigned against judicial corruption in New York City by the Irish Catholics led by William Tweed\u2019s <italic>Tammany Hall</italic>, which resulted in hearings and the impeachment of Justice George Barnard.\nSince the 1860s, August Belmont engaged in New York\u2019s public finances, which were under the control of. The <italic>Committee of Seventy</italic>, led by insurgent Democrats and others, aimed to cleanse politics after Tweed\u2019s exposure in 1871. Opposing reform, Belmont shielded Tweed from debt criticism, upholding the city\u2019s credit. When Seligman refused to fund New York, Belmont sold bonds via <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, and <italic>Disconto</italic> to sustain New York\u2019s credit on European exchanges. However, Seligman had the support of <italic>OIL</italic>. \nAn extended cousin of John Morgan and his Tracy wife, William Whitney had married Oliver Payne\u2019s daughter in 1869, before the latter merged his Cleveland oil refinery with Rockefeller to form <italic>OIL</italic> and became <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s banker. Winning as a reform candidate soon after was William Havemeyer, who made a fortune in sugar refining before serving as Democratic Mayor in the 1840s. While he resigned from his bank directorships at the start of the Civil War, Havemeyer became mayor until his death in 1874.\nAfter helping break the corrupt <italic>Tammany Hall</italic> ring, Whitney reorganized New York\u2019s corporation counsel office over six years from 1875. Fighting Boss Tweed alongside Seligman and Whitney, <italic>Columbia</italic> Law graduate Francis Stetson then served as New York\u2019s Assistant Counsel before becoming <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s preferred lawyer for over a century in a firm that would later be known as <italic>Davis Polk</italic>. \nThe law firm kinterlinked to <italic>Morgan</italic> through Senior Partner Charles Tracey, John Morgan\u2019s brother-in-law. The firm also associated closely with Grover Cleveland. Cleveland\u2019s grandfather was Reverend Aaron Cleveland, whose sister married Stephen Higginson and daughter married David Dodge. While Higginson\u2019s son formed <italic>Lee</italic>, Dodge\u2019s son formed <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>. From 1869 to 1881, Cleveland was a lawyer for the <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>New York Central</italic> RR. Between his Democratic presidential terms, Cleveland joined the law firm. \nAfter Tracey\u2019s death in 1887, Stetson, Cleveland\u2019s friend and Morgan\u2019s personal attorney, gained dominance of the firm. Stetson later fused his law firm with that of Frederick Jennings, a cousin once removed of <italic>OIL</italic> co-founder and Rockefeller-in-law Oliver Burr Jennings. And since collaborating with <italic>Morgan</italic> in managing <italic>New York Central</italic> RR, Whitney supported Cleveland\u2019s election and became Navy Secretary from 1885. Cleveland\u2019s Secretary of War from 1885 was William Crowninshield Endicott, married to the niece of George Peabody, who started <italic>Peabody</italic> with John Morgan\u2019s father<italic> </italic>Junius Morgan as a Senior Partner.\nDuring this time, several <italic>Columbia </italic>Law<italic> </italic>graduate Seligman cousins started <italic>Seligman Seligman </italic>law firm in the 1880s. Levinger was less fortunate with the seizure of his brewery investment by the federal government due to unpaid taxes. Following the failure of <italic>German</italic> <italic>Uptown Savings Bank</italic>, embezzlement of clients\u2019 funds became apparent by late 1875. Levinger fled, but soon died from yellow fever in Cuba. During this time, Guggenheimer retained Levinger\u2019s clients, and grew the law firm amongst German-Jewish immigrants, first by making her a leader in the brewing industry and, adding his half-brothers, forming <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic>.\nAnother law firm blossomed. The Presbyterian grandson of an Irish barrister and political Indiana lawyer, Algernon Sullivan represented Southern business interests in New York before the <italic>Civil War</italic>. Despite blackballing by <italic>New York Bar Association</italic>, the progressive sponsored the first Black lawyer to be admitted to the <italic>New York Bar</italic>. When his Southern clients immigrated north and requested his services, Sullivan returned to private practice and sent his bookkeeper, William Cromwell, to law school in 1870. \nBy 1879, they established <italic>Sullivan Cromwell </italic>(\u201c<italic>Sullivan</italic>\u201d), which went on to become one of the most successful law firms in the world. Sullivan died in 1887, but his legacy lived on through the continued success of the firm. Back in 1884, Cromwell hired Sullivan\u2019s subpar son George and his exceptional Jewish classmate, Alfred Jaretzki, who became Managing Partner after Cromwell died. As <italic>Sullivan </italic>accumulated the most Jews on Wall Street\u2019s law firms for the better part of a century, all were Jaretzki\u2019s relatives as with other partners. \nWhile his brothers left for Paris, Solomon Lazard married the daughter of the Parnas of Los Angeles Newmark, Marc Meyer married her sister in 1869. The families continued importing French products and engaging in other businesses. When a major flood destroying the city\u2019s dam and left her waterless in 1867, Solomon and two others acquired the waterworks lease for thirty years and incorporated the venture. (When the lease ran out, the waterworks served as the foundation of the municipally-owned Los Angeles Department of Water & Power.) By 1873, Solomon became the founding president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. When Solomon retired a year later, he dissolved his firm, and Meyer took over. \nMeanwhile, Solomon\u2019s brothers focused on banking. As <italic>Seligman</italic> allied with HSBC\u2019s <italic>Sassoon</italic> to form <italic>Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>California Bank </italic>in 1873 to compete with <italic>London & San Francisco Bank</italic> of 1865. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, President Grant called for the repeal of BA1867 as it produced \u201c<italic>more evil than good at this time.</italic>\u201d  eliminated illiquidity triggers, tensed involuntary filings, eased voluntary discharges and majority compositions. While silver inflation kept filings low, it deflated as Congress\u2019  of June 1875 committed to issue bonds to redeem notes in gold, end USLTN, and to raise tariffs without the other taxes. \nWithin a month, <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic> liquidated and creditors filed for an involuntary bankruptcy. As Ralston\u2019s Comstock Lode mines lacked dividends and his <italic>Bank of California</italic> failed in the <italic>Panic of 1875</italic>, Ralston lost control and died from suspected suicide. While Seligman cousin-in-law Isaiah Hellman\u2019s <italic>Farmers & Merchants Bank</italic> suspended like all the regional banks, his grocery business paid all dues, allowing him to lead Pacific bankers. Although Nevada\u2019s Comstock Lode magnate John Mackay co-founded <italic>Bank of Nevada of San Francisco</italic>, <italic>Bank of California</italic> reorganized with Ogden Mills as President again. Unable to repeal the <italic>Specie Resumption Act</italic>, inflationist Democrats circulated silver and allowed USLTN unsecured by gold.\nSan Francisco\u2019s first bank clearing house organized by 1876. By then, a Goudchaux cousinhood of French Jewish immigrants from Phalsbourg, Alsace, formed in San Francisco, including <italic>Lazard</italic>, Raphael Weill (department store owner), Henry Kahn (jeweler), Jules Kahn (dry goods importer), and Isaac Loeb (dry goods merchant). As <italic>Lazard</italic> London opened that year, Alex Weill, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s bookkeeping cousin, shifted from commerce to banking. Along with trading securities, Weill arbitraged gold and silver <italic>dollars</italic>. \nBy 1880, Weill established <italic>Lazard</italic> New York. However, New York operations remained lower than those of California. After Bohemian Jew Charles Altschul, immigrated from London to become <italic>Lazard</italic> San Francisco\u2019s eighth hire in 1877, his uncle by marriage, Eugene Arnstein, a Bavarian-born fourth great-grandson of Samson Wertheim and <italic>K\u00f6nigswarter</italic> Paris affiliate, joined by 1881. In 1883, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York hired FX specialist Eug\u00e8ne Mehler, a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe from <italic>Speyer</italic>. The son of a Bingen banker, Mehler turned <italic>Lazard</italic> New York into American\u2019s main gold supplier to France and Austria as<italic> </italic><italic>Lazard</italic> London incorporated <italic>London, Paris</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> & American Bank</italic> in London and branched to San Francisco in 1884. They split California gold exports with <italic>London & San Francisco Bank</italic> of 1865 and <italic>Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>California Bank </italic>of 1873.\nOutside of <italic>Lazard</italic>, extended cousins engaged in commerce and finance across the country. Born in Alsace to Esther Cerf Aron Lazard\u2019s cousin once removed, Mayer Halff and his brothers arrived in Texas by the 1850s. From running a dry goods store in Liberty, Texas, they entered the cattle industry by accepting livestock as payment from customers who could not pay in cash. Owning over six million acres of ranchland in the 1870s at their peak, the family also had cattle interests in Wyoming and Iowa. Along with founding and serving as President of <italic>City</italic> NB <italic>of San Antonio</italic>, Mayer joined his brother to start <italic>Alamo</italic> NB in San Antonio. At the turn of the century, two of Mayer\u2019s children married Oppenheim banking family of San Antonio, who descended from Court Jew Samuel Oppenheim and financed many of the early cattle drives.\nLikewise, Bohemia-born Jacob Furth\u2014an extended relative of the families of Austrian Court Jew Popper, Wertheim Porges, and Charles Altschul\u2014immigrated to San Francisco in 1856. After working in retail, he opened his own store in 1862 and later running a general store in Colusa, California, he relocated to Seattle, Washington, in 1883, co-founding <italic>Puget Sound </italic>NB. By 1893, he was president of the bank and remained so until merging with <italic>Seattle</italic> NB. In 1903, Furth organized <italic>Seattle Electric Co</italic> and led <italic>Puget Sound Electric </italic>RR, managing rail lines between Seattle and Tacoma. He also presided over <italic>California Land & Stock Co</italic>, which managed 14,000 acres in Lincoln County. From 1885 to 1891, Furth served on the Seattle City Council.\nEarlier, Scotch-Irish immigrant Alex Stewart founded New York City\u2019s first major department store, <italic>Stewart</italic>. He became one of the nation\u2019s richest citizens and, in 1872, bought <italic>Grand Union Hotel</italic> in Saratoga Springs, New York. Despite being nominated as President Grant\u2019s UST Secretary, a legal issue prevented his confirmation. After his death, Judge Henry Hilton, inherited the hotel. Since New York\u2019s <italic>Committee of Seventy</italic> reformist civil body exposed the <italic>Tweed Gang</italic>\u2019s corrupt rule of New York, <italic>Tweed</italic> member Judge Henry Hilton sought revenge. \nCiting racial reasons, Hilton denied entry to the hotel for <italic>Committee of Seventy</italic>\u2019s prominent member and <italic>Seligman</italic>\u2019s founder Joseph Seligman and his family in 1877. Hilton\u2019s policy caused a public boycott, leading to the collapse of <italic>Hilton Hughes</italic>, which managed <italic>Stewart</italic>. While John Wanamaker of Philadelphia took over <italic>Stewart</italic> year that year, the hotel later returned to the Stewart estate. While some Jews retaliated by buying several of the leading hotels, signs reading \u201cNo Jews or Dogs Admitted Here\u201d remained in Saratoga as late as 1890.\nAs UST built gold reserves for the <italic>Resumption</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and <italic>Seligman</italic> refunded her in 1878. However, unable to repeal the <italic>Specie Resumption Act</italic>, inflationist Democrats circulated silver and allowed USLTN without gold backing. Also that year, Congress eliminated federal bankruptcy law. Still, NBA provided NBs with non-liquidating compositions. Moreover, the Court allowed railroad receivers to write down debt and pay suppliers ahead of investors. Other debtors relied on state laws, which shaped credit. New York and three states only allowed voluntary insolvencies. New England also allowed involuntary filings, like Europe. \nSince James Scrymser married into New York\u2019s first private banker <italic>Prime</italic>, his <italic>International Ocean Telegraph </italic>became the first cable to Latin America in 1866 and <italic>Erlanger</italic> banked <italic>Reuter\u2019s</italic> trans-Atlantic French cable to connect Brest to the Saint-Lawrence River in 1869. However, Britain <italic>Imperial</italic>\u2019s led by John Pender gained control of the latter during the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> and Jay Gould seized <italic>International Ocean Telegraph </italic>in 1878. Likewise, Gould\u2019s UPR leased out Wyoming bituminous coal lands from 1868, soon starting a rate war with the Mormons.\nAfter the assassination of Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith in 1844, Brigham Young married Smith\u2019s wife and assumed leadership. In 1857, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints pursued specific economic and defensive strategies. They promoted home manufacture and grain conservation to address merchant absence and established the Deseret Currency Association in 1858, with Young as president, to provide banking services. Additionally, they raised a fully equipped thousand-man army, and organized civilians to safeguard property in case of invasion. With the Church supporting mining, Coalville started in 1859.\nIn Salt Lake City, Utah, the Mormon Church initiated the cooperative boycott in 1868. As merchants established <italic>Zion\u2019s Co-operative Banking Institution</italic>, with. As the Mormon Church started <italic>Zion\u2019s Co-operative Mercantile Institution</italic> in 1868, <italic>Provo Woolen Mills</italic> in 1869, and <italic>Washington Cotton Factory</italic> in 1869. Young becoming a leading stockholder of <italic>Zion\u2019s Co-operative Banking Institution</italic> in 1869, subsequently chartering and incorporating as <italic>Deseret</italic> SB in 1871. \nWith the completion of the transnational railroad in 1869, plans started to link Coalville to UPR. Utah\u2019s first SB. In response to the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Young founded <italic>Zion\u2019s Savings Bank & Trust Co</italic>. Salt Lake City continued financing<italic> </italic>streetcar and gas companies in the 1870s, and four railroads. Following a rate war with Gould, Young sold his roads to UPR, consolidating its dominance in coal transportation.\nUntil Congress restricted Chinese immigrants in 1882, Gould leased Chinese credit-ticket cartel indentured servants at half the rate of Whites. In 1878, Congress required UPR to deleverage, squeezing Gould. The Court upheld this per <italic>Munn</italic>. The decision forced Gould to innovate HC debt to tap financing within the 1873 law. Rather than issue asset-backed bonds, Gould\u2019s HC sold liens on UPR stocks pledged as bank loan collateral. Unlike charters overseen by state courts, HCs had inter-state reach since federal courts adjudicated common law trust partnerships. Rockefeller followed by forming <italic>OIL</italic> into a legal <italic>trust</italic> that invested in partner railroad and oil ventures and bound them to fixed outputs. <italic>OIL</italic> then pooled rates with affiliated railroads. \nLike America, Britain had private telegraphy before nationalizing the technology in 1870 and joining France and Germany. These public systems charged low rates for social messages within their jurisdictions, charging more for international use. While American telegraphs competed on speed for businesses, fewer Americans used it. Rather than expropriate <italic>Western Union\u2019</italic>s assets, USPO<italic> </italic>proposed <italic>Savings Banks</italic> (\u201cUSPSBs\u201d) in 1871, combining the British financial inclusion innovation of savings banks to invest in public telegraphy and UST debt. However, USPSBs risked disintermediating private banks. USPSBs could not stabilize private bank deposits or inter-state transfers, unlike central banks. Congress rejected USPSBs despite presidential endorsement.\nFor decades, state and municipal interests fought off the Court\u2019s inter-state trade freedom. Finally, in 1878, the Court struck down inter-state tax discrimination. So,<italic> </italic>per letter but not the spirit of the<italic> Post Roads Act of 1866, Western Union</italic> spread to Florida. The Court also allowed <italic>Singer</italic> to disrupt local manufacturers. This decision fueled advances in refrigerated railroad cars and large inter-state meatpackers out of Chicago. From 1873, Congress expanded federal oversight to humane animal transport and disease containment. \nThe meatpackers came from diverse backgrounds. When the social upheaval after the Revolution of 1848 led to confiscation of their cattle herding in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the Jewish Beisinger family sent their young son to join an uncle in America, where he became Nelson Morris. After becoming a Chicago packer in 1857, Morris formed his business in 1859. (Morris may have been related to Katz descendant Benjamin Bissinger, who later married Henry Greenbaum\u2019s niece-in-law.) Also in 1859, Allerton of Upstate New York entered the market. Extended cousins of Allerton and <italic>Morton</italic>, the Swift family of New York followed in 1875. So did the Armour, extended cousins-in-law of <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> and Juliet Pierpont Morgan. \nHowever, western states favored local meatpackers by requiring state officials to inspect meat a day before slaughter for public health. As the Court struck down the law as protectionist in 1890, the meatpackers pushed for federal inspection, which Congress soon established. Without protectionism, <italic>Armour</italic>, <italic>Swift</italic>, <italic>Morris</italic>, <italic>Cudahy</italic> (affiliated with <italic>Armour</italic>), and <italic>Libby McNeil</italic> incorporated and split the market, led by the first two.\nWhile <italic>Singer</italic> dominated its industry,<italic> </italic>the farm equipment industry mirrored the meatpacking oligopolistic competition. Since Chicago\u2019s Cyrus McCormick revolutionized farming by inventing the reaper, he competed with the large <italic>Deering</italic> and several smaller firms. Family alliances helped. By 1882, Cyrus McCormick\u2019s niece married the brother of Chauncey Blair. Blair\u2019s son-in-law ran <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings Bank</italic> required investment from Armour, while Blair served as the President of <italic>Merchants</italic> NB until his son succeeded him in 1888, and son engaged in his father\u2019s packing firm of <italic>Culbertson Blair</italic>\u2014Chicago\u2019s second largest\u2014and later in the grain commission business. \nAlongside industry, Chicago investment banks soon flourished. Norman Harris, born in Massachusetts, descended from Emperor Charlemagne and Puritan colonists, Norman started his business career at 18 as a soliciting agent for a LIC in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1867, he organized <italic>Union Central</italic> LIC. After marrying a descendant of a signer of the <italic>Declaration of the Independence</italic> in 1879, Harris formed the Chicago private bank <italic>Harris</italic> in 1881, focusing on municipal bonds. \nJames Taliaferro, another descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, was among Florida\u2019s earliest bankers. Born to Virginia planters descended, Taliaferro\u2019s extended cousins included the Kentucky bankers <italic>Alexander</italic>. After the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Taliaferro moved to Jacksonville, Florida, and became active in lumber. In 1883, he helped establish <italic>First</italic> NB of Tampa. Elected to the Senate in 1889, Taliaferro soon became President of the bank, which his family led for decades.\nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, <italic>COALA</italic> accumulated debt through <italic>Morgan</italic> to gain control of a third of Pennsylvania\u2019s anthracite coal. She also entered into a trust agreement with <italic>Morgan</italic>-financed <italic>PENN</italic> and competing transport railroads. However, the work suspensions and wage reductions spurred labor union strikes, <italic>Lehigh</italic> left the trust in 1876. However, growing production forced <italic>COALA</italic> to dissolve the trust. With British funds from 1877, <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Clark </italic>reorged <italic>COALA</italic>, <italic>Lehigh</italic>, and West Virginia\u2019s bituminous roads (\u201c<italic>COALB</italic>\u201d). <italic>COALB</italic> extended Maryland\u2019s <italic>Baltimore & Ohio</italic> to Norfolk and Chattanooga. As anthracite prices fell, roads suspended dividends and lowered wages. In 1877, the largest strike of the 1870s struck <italic>COALB</italic>. With strikes spreading inter-state, President Hayes ordered the <italic>National Guard</italic> to restore order. \nBack in 1730, SBUS President Nicholas Biddle\u2019 great uncle John Biddle had married Sarah Owen, whose cousin then married John Roberts, a fellow descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, shortly after. A descendant of a Welsh gentleman farmer who purchased land from William Penn in the 17th century, Roberts\u2019 sons founded <italic>Pencoyd Iron Works</italic> on the banks of the Schuylkill, which they reorganized into <italic>American Bridge</italic> in the 1850s to take advantage of <italic>COALA</italic>. \nJohn Roberts\u2019 sister married John Paul, and their son engaged in the China and East Indies trade. As John Paul\u2019s grandson became a Philadelphia lawyer, his son John married a daughter of Anthony Drexel\u2014whose other daughter had earlier married a grandson of Nicholas Biddle\u2014in 1877 and, the following year, his daughter married a son of Jacob Astor. Since <italic>Drexel</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic> financed <italic>PENN</italic>, <italic>American Bridge</italic> heir George Roberts\u2014John Paul\u2019s third cousin\u2014became Head of<italic> PENN </italic>in 1880. Several years later, Paul became a <italic>Drexel</italic> partner.\nConcurrently, Midwestern specialist <italic>Lainer Winslow </italic>kinterlinked with <italic>Morgan</italic>. A descendant of the Boston Brahmin forefathers of two presidents as well as Minot, Gardner, Norton, and other families, Edward Adams joined a Boston bank and broker as a cashier and clerk in 1866, and then became partner after assisting the organization of another bank in that city several years later in 1870. Six years after he married John Morgan\u2019s cousin, a grandniece of Reverend James Pierpont, in 1872, Adams joined <italic>Lainer Winslow</italic> as partner and worked with <italic>Morgan</italic>. By 1880, Adams joined <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Belmont</italic> to manage <italic>Saint-Paul & Northern Pacific</italic> RR\u2019s bond issue to link the Dakotas and Portland, Oregon. Among the 17 banks in the syndicate were <italic>Seligman</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and <italic>Kendy</italic>, who was engaged in a rival road. \nSince 1877, <italic>Kendy</italic> served as James Hill\u2019s banker to form and grow <italic>Great Northern</italic> RR. Born into a Presbyterian family of Lanarkshire, Scotland, Kendy worked for a Glasgow iron and coal company and was sent to America in 1850, joining <italic>Jesup</italic> in 1857. In 1868, he resigned to found <italic>Kendy</italic> and channel Scottish investments into American railroads. \nAfter Kendy resigned from <italic>Jesup</italic>, Morris Jesup formed <italic>Jesup Paton</italic> with John Paton, whose father was Scottish Reverend John Paton. By 1879, <italic>Jesup Paton</italic> hired Jesup\u2019s nephew, Cornelius Ledyard Cuyler, who became a partner in 1882. When Jesup retired in 1884, Paton ran the firm until retiring in 1892, when Culyter partnered with Junius Morgan to form <italic>Cuyler Morgan</italic>. A nephew of John Morgan, Junius graduated <italic>Princeton</italic> in 1888 and married Josephine Adams Perry, a Boston Brahmin descendant of Commodore Perry\u2019s brother and second cousin of <italic>Rothschild</italic> affiliate August Belmont Jr.\nMeanwhile, <italic>Belmont</italic> linked American and European finance. Since 1859, when <italic>Citi</italic> President Moses Taylor\u2019s daughter married Robert Winthrop\u2014a <italic>Drexel</italic> partner until Anthony Drexel partnered with John Morgan\u2014 Winthrop\u2019s cousin had married a Perry sister-in-law of August Belmont, the families reinforced kinterlinks as in 1889 as Taylor\u2019s grandson married Gardiner Howland\u2019s son, whose uncle had married August Belmont\u2019s sister in 1877. While Taylor had invested in <italic>Delaware, Lackawanna & Western</italic> RR, Howland was a <italic>COALB </italic>investor and his sister was the third wife of former BONY President Isaac Roosevelt\u2019s son James. \nBuying the insolvent <italic>Alabama Great Southern</italic> RR by 1877, Slidell and Belmont-in-law Emile Erlanger cofounded <italic>Alabama Coal, Iron, Land & Colonization</italic> in 1882 as part of <italic>Alabama Great</italic>\u2019s expansion strategy. Creating a comprehensive transportation network from Washington to New Orleans, <italic>Alabama Great</italic> strategically leased <italic>Cincinnati Southern </italic>RR, bought <italic>Vicksburg & Meridian</italic> RR and <italic>Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific </italic>RR, and constructed <italic>New Orleans & Northeastern</italic> RR. As a new cartel briefly stabilized prices, <italic>COALA</italic> lobbied to delegalize <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s rate agreements. <italic>COALA</italic>\u2019s insolvency grew as the measures failed. Although <italic>COALA</italic> appealed to <italic>Morgan</italic> to reorganize her debt in 1882, Anthony Drexel refused because he mistrusted the management. \nSince restoring Alabama\u2019s credit access and starting a SB in Queens, New York, during the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Emanuel Lehman joined New York financiers to re-establish <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB <italic>of New</italic> <italic>York</italic> in 1880. Within a year, <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB appointed William Saint-John as cashier. The son of Alabama\u2019s <italic>Saint-John Powers</italic> banker Newton Saint-John, Saint-John joined his in-laws at New York\u2019s <italic>Alexander</italic> after the <italic>Civil War</italic>, and held positions with in-laws and others at <italic>Fabbri Chauncey</italic>, <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>, and <italic>Havemeyer </italic>sugar refiner. \nBy 1883, Saint-John was promoted to the presidency of <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB, also becoming a director of <italic>Second</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> and other banks. The same year, <italic>Phelps</italic> <italic>Dodge </italic>kinterlinked <italic>New York</italic> LIC <italic>& Trust</italic>. With Northern capital, <italic>Lehman</italic> expanded from factoring to manufacturing in Alabama, including a cotton mill on the Tallapoosa River, and Southern railroads. \nWhile Emanuel Lehman was a <italic>Richmond </italic>director, his brother Mayer chaired <italic>Montgomery-Tuscaloosa</italic> RR. By 1882, Emanuel Lehman\u2019s daughter Hattie married Philip Goodhart\u2014whose father operated a clothing business in Cincinnati since before the 1850s and sister married a manager of Lehman\u2019s New Orleans cotton brokerage 1865\u2014who founded brokerage <italic>Goodhart</italic> on Wall Street that year. Soon after, Goodhart\u2019s brother Albert and Hattie\u2019s brother Philip married Lauer sisters, cousins of <italic>Mack</italic>.\nSince Marcus Goldman\u2019s daughter wed Ludwig Gallenberg, a cousin-in-law of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Solomon Loeb, in 1870, two of Joseph Sachs\u2019 sons married Marcus\u2019 daughters by the end of the decade. While Marcus started <italic>Goldman Sachs</italic> (\u201c<italic>Goldman</italic>\u201d) in 1882 with one son and a son-in-law, his <italic>Harvard</italic> dropout son Henry joined his brother-in-law Gallenberg\u2019s dry goods store. Likewise, <italic>Hallgarten</italic> hired Jacob Schiff\u2019s former partner, Henry Budge, who led railroad reorgs for the firm for two decades.\nLike with banking and railroads, British and American communications competition differed. Since Britain\u2019s Postmaster nationalized British telegraphy in 1869, he gained exclusive rights to transmit telegrams. The first independent British telephone service provider started in 1879 and in 1880 merged with <italic>Morgan</italic> financed <italic>Edison Telephone </italic>to form <italic>United Telephone</italic>. Parliament took legal action in 1880 against <italic>United Telephone</italic>, claiming it violated the monopolization law from 1869. Britain\u2019s Court ruled the telephone was a telegraph, revoking the merger and mandating that telephone companies to be licensed by Postmaster. \nIn America, telephony competed. While his father was a second cousin once removed of John Morgan\u2019s mother and director of <italic>Mutual </italic>LIC of New York, Richard McCurdy became <italic>Mutual</italic>\u2019s VP in 1865 and President from 1885. His sister married Gardiner Hubbard, a son of the Justice of Massachusetts, whose cousin once removed-in-law was John Murray Forbes. While their daughter married Alex Bell, Gardiner\u2019s brother married a third cousin of John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife and became the first secretary of Bell\u2019s <italic>American Bell Telephone</italic> in 1877. By 1879, James Forbes\u2019 son Hathaway encouraged his friend Henry Lee Higginson to finance and gained control of <italic>American Bell</italic>. While <italic>Western Union</italic> absorbed most telegraphs in 1880, George Godfrey of Maine\u2014who parlayed lumber government contracting during the <italic>Civil War</italic>\u2014co-founded competitive systems that he soon fused into <italic>Mutual Union Telegraph</italic>.<italic></italic>\nIn 1878, Egisto Fabbri persuaded John Morgan to back Thomas Edison of Ohio with <italic>Western Union</italic><italic> </italic>and William Vanderbilt\u2019s son-in-law. <italic>Morgan</italic> incorporated <italic>Edison</italic> in the spring of 1881 amidst an electric boom with nearly 20 new competitors before in the bubble burst in the summer and light companies lost financing as Britain nationalized the industry<italic>.</italic><italic></italic> One of the investors was Charles Flint of the South American trade with WR <italic>Grace</italic>,<italic> </italic>who built <italic>US Electric Lighting Co</italic>, previously funded by investors including <italic>Equitable</italic> LIC and <italic>Phelps Dodge </italic>interests. While Flint fused <italic>US Electric Lighting </italic>with <italic>Weston Electric Light Co</italic> to offer a complete lighting system, they battled with <italic>Edison</italic>\u2019s patents for over a decade. \nIn 1879, Frederick Moseley formed Boston broker <italic>Moseley</italic>, specializing in short-term credit for industrial clients, including <italic>Edison</italic>. Frederick\u2019s great-grandfather Ebenezer\u2014a son of Reverend Samuel Mosley of Windham, Connecticut\u2014married Martha Lyman Strong, a great-granddaughter of Elder John Strong. After Ebenezer fought at Bunker Hill, and later served as a Connecticut legislator, his son practiced law in Newburyport, Massachusetts, and his son, Edward, engaged in the East Indies trade before becoming President of <italic>Mechanics </italic>NB. While Edward connected his son Frederick to the Lyman Delano, Clark, and Morgan families, Frederick\u2019s wife was an extended cousin of<italic> Lee Higginson</italic> and <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>.\nAs <italic>Edison</italic> illuminated <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s office in 1882, Pittsburgh\u2019s <italic>Westinghouse</italic> and <italic>Carnegie</italic> replaced coal with gas. Likewise, Boston Brahmin Godfrey Lowell Cabot organized <italic>Cabot</italic> to use natural gas to produce carbon black. And the same year in Germany, <italic>Mitteldeutsche Credit</italic> co-founder <italic>Sulzbach</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>Nationalbank</italic> of Berlin, <italic>Lando</italic> of Breslau, <italic>Bayerische Vereinsbank</italic> co-founder <italic>Guggenheimayer </italic>of Munich, and several others funded Emil Rathenau. A Jewish engineer from a Berlin textile family and a cousin-in-law of Oppenheim cousins, Rathenau had married a Speyer cousin. A year later, Rathenau partnered with inventor Werner Siemens and his family <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> to lease <italic>Edison</italic>\u2019s patents to create <italic>German Edison</italic>. \nIn New York, politics and religion continued to drive finance. Since Puritan Andrew Ward of the Connecticut General Court co-founded the town and first church in Watertown, Connecticut, in 1636, his descendants continued his civic involvement. Five generations later, the son of a deacon, Levi graduated <italic>Yale</italic> and practiced medicine in Connecticut. After helping found Genesee, New York, in 1807, Levi established the first mail route in Western New York, and later became President of <italic>Savings Bank of Rochester</italic> and <italic>Rochester Bank</italic>. \nWhile Levi\u2019s son Ferdinand trained at <italic>Princeton</italic>, served as a missionary in India, and then as Pastor of Genesee, Levi\u2019s daughter married Troy-born Freeman Clarke. Clarke began his financial career as Cashier of <italic>Bank of Orleans</italic>, Albion, New York, before moving to Rochester and serving as a director and president of banks, railroads, and telegraph and trust companies of Rochester. By 1865, President Lincoln appointed Clarke as Comptroller of the Currency. By 1880, Ferdinand\u2019s son Ferdinand Jr secured a loan from his uncle Clarke and <italic>Marine </italic>NB to form a partnership with former President Grant\u2019s son, <italic>Grant Ward</italic>.\nLikewise, mixed religion banks reached new heights. In Britain, after a Christian clerk resigned from <italic>Wagg</italic> on the Sabbath in the 1870s, the Duke of Argyll\u2019s son, Walter Campbell, whose brother married a daughter of Queen Victoria in 1871, joined <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s stockbroker <italic>Wagg</italic> with Henri Bischoffsheim and Lionel Rothschild facilitating the landmark event. Kinterlinking with Wertheim descendants, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s stockbrokers\u2014and Katz descendants\u2014<italic>Wagg</italic> soon converted.\nWhile New York\u2019s William and Washington Vermilye withdrew from <italic>Vermilye</italic> after the <italic>Civil War</italic>, their younger brother ran <italic>Merchants\u2019</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>. Instead of family, the brothers promoted Donald Mackay\u2014the son of a Brooklyn banker not closely related to <italic>Bank of Nevada of San Francisco</italic> founder John Mackay\u2014to partner. By 1877, Mackay hired Brooklyn-born <italic>Polytechnic Institute</italic> graduate William Read, whose father was a successful merchant and mother came from a family of clergy. \nSince William Vermilye\u2019s daughter married <italic>New York Bar Association</italic> co-founder John Burrill, a descendant of colonial Massachusetts magistrates, John\u2019s law clientele included the Vanderbilts. While one of John\u2019s son joined him in law, another, William Vermilye Burrill, joined NYSE in 1884. Within a year, the latter partnered to form <italic>Burrill Housman</italic> with Arthur Housman, a son of a Jewish mercantile immigrated from W\u00fcrttemberg and likely cousin-in-law of K\u00f6nigswarter, who was related to Wertheim, Oppenheim, and <italic>Kuhn </italic>partners.\nWhile Vermilye had been married a Roosevelt cousin, his death severed the relationship. That year, James Jr, the son of <italic>Delaware & Hudson</italic> RR President James Roosevelt Sr, married Helen Schermerhorn Astor. While James Sr himself married his grandfather\u2019s niece-in-law, a Baltimore Howland of <italic>COALB</italic>, she soon wife. So, he wed <italic>COALB</italic>\u2019s Sara Delano in 1880, the mother of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (\u201cFDR\u201d). \nBack in 1878, James Sr\u2019s cousin-twice-removed, James-Alfred, took over his father\u2019s <italic>Chemical</italic> NB and other directorships. Abandoning plate-glass, James-Alfred refocused <italic>Roosevelt</italic> to bank railroads. By 1882, his son married a Lowell, a Cabot and Tracy cousin. <italic>Roosevelt</italic> also founded <italic>Broadway Improvement</italic> to buy and develop New York real estate but was a critic of Gould. \nWhile James-Alfred\u2019s cousin Theodore Jr married a daughter of <italic>Lee</italic> banker George Cabot Lee in 1880, she died in 1884, before Theodore Jr became President.  In 1883, Theodore Jr\u2019s brother, Elliott, married Anna Hall, a descendant of the Schuyler and Livingston families. After their deaths in the 1890s, their daughter, Eleanor, was raised by Anna\u2019s cousin Susan Ludlow and her husband, Henry Parish, a <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> in-law. Eleanor later married FDR. Anna\u2019s sister married broker William Morgs, a descendant of Elder John Strong.\nTheodore Jr\u2019s career followed the path of his father, Theodore Sr, and uncle, Robert, both Wall Street bankers tied to <italic>Morgan</italic>-controlled railroads. His cousin and adviser, William Roosevelt, and brother-in-law, Douglas Robinson, served on New York bank boards, including <italic>Astor</italic> NB, led by <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s key ally, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> President George Baker. In 1882, Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s sister Corinne married Douglas Robinson. Robinson\u2019s great-uncle\u2019s father-in-law was John Campbell, 7th Duke of Argyll, while his second great-uncle through his mother was former President James Monroe. Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, Robinson graduated from <italic>Oxford</italic> in 1876, and moved to New York. Robinson focused on real estate and was a Director of <italic>Astor</italic> NB. By 1881, James Roosevelt Sr\u2019s cousin thrice removed\u2014by way of Helena Roosevelt Barclay\u2014married the daughter of William Vanderbilt.\nBy 1880, Cornelius Vanderbilt connected Pennsylvania coal into to the Great Lakes, <italic>Erie</italic> expanded into Chicago, and <italic>Northern Pacific</italic> developed coal in the West and Canada. As Cornelius died that year, his son William took lead of the family. Concerned about his control of New York water- and railways, Vanderbilt contracted <italic>Morgan</italic> to distribute ownership. So, as Jay Gould sold his UPR stake, <italic>Morgan</italic> financed his <italic>Wabash RR</italic> and <italic>Western Union</italic> acquisitions. Like with UPR, Gould started a coal rate war with the <italic>Wabash</italic>. And to counter Morgan<italic>-</italic>aligned <italic>PENN</italic>, Vanderbilt launched <italic>South Pennsylvania</italic> RR in 1883 and allied with Carnegie and Rockefeller.\nSince 1880, Using UPR-style RHC bonds, Gould resumed rate wars to grow. As Native American Oklahoma legalized mining and attracted Gould, Porfirio D\u00edaz started his long presidency in Mexico and sought to settle debts and reestablish diplomatic relations with France. When <italic>Paribas</italic> funded <italic>Mexican</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>(\u201c<italic>Banamax</italic>\u201d) as banknote monopoly in 1881, Mexico had three banks, including <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic> since 1864. Soon after, a new Mexican law requiring local banks, <italic>Banamax</italic> bought Spanish-financed <italic>Banco Mercantil Agricola e Hipotecario </italic>in 1884. As <italic>Banamax</italic> received a railroad concession, Cassel and <italic>Kuhn</italic> funded construction of <italic>Mexican Central </italic>RR.\nHowever, Gould faced competition. While Gould expanded <italic>Texas & Pacific</italic> RR to secure routes in Texas, he soon conflicted with his wife\u2019s fourth cousin once removed, Collis Huntington, who expanded his <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR and <italic>Southern Pacific</italic> RR by investing in <italic>Galveston, Harrisburg, & San Antonio</italic> RR from 1877 with <italic>Speyer</italic> financing. While Gould and Huntington negotiated a truce in 1881, allowing <italic>Texas & Pacific</italic> RR to remain in central Texas, Gould and <italic>Louisville</italic> <italic>& Nashville RR </italic>(\u201cL&N\u201d) collaborated to consolidate resources as Huntington acquired Charles Morgan\u2019s transportation empire, including <italic>Louisiana & Texas</italic> RR and <italic>Southern Steamship</italic>, in 1883.\nBack in the 1830s, after President Jackson killed SBUS\u2019 federal banknote monopoly, Southern states chartered banks to build railroads with rented slaves. To position Atlanta as a grain hub, Georgia subsidized chartered railroads to coal deposits in Tennessee\u2019s Chattanooga by 1852, which Virginia\u2019s <italic>Richmond</italic> RR and Nashville via <italic>Tennessee Coal & Iron</italic> RHC (\u201c<italic>COALT</italic>\u201d) also soon connected into. By 1859, L&N linked coal-rich Kentucky to the Mississippi River via Nashville. Soon after, L&N brought <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s kerosene into the South.\nSince 1880, L&N gained control of <italic>Tennessee-Saint-Louis </italic>RR and collaborated with Jay Gould against Collis Huntington, who expanded his <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR and <italic>Southern Pacific</italic> RR. The foreclosure of <italic>Atlantic, Mississippi, & Ohio</italic> RR posed another challenge. Despite support from <italic>Atlantic</italic>\u2019s president and the involvement of prominent London houses, John Collinson faced opposition in merging the two. \nEventually, Clarence Clark, senior <italic>Clark</italic> partner and L&N director, outbid Collinson in the foreclosure sale, leading to the establishment of <italic>Norfolk & Western</italic> RR in 1881, which focused primarily on coal interests and sought connections with Tennessee before turning to the coal-rich mountains of Virginia. <italic>Atlantic</italic>\u2019s northern portion, <italic>New York, Pennsylvania, & Ohio RR,</italic> listed on NYSE and leased herself to <italic>Erie</italic> RR. \nAfter Jere Baxter reorganized <italic>COALT</italic> RHC in 1866, he linked British collieries in 1875, and acquired them in 1882. Baxter\u2019s brother Nathenial was a director of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Nashville</italic>, which absorbed <italic>Mechanics</italic> NB in 1880, and in 1883, merged with <italic>Merchants</italic> NB. As <italic>COALT</italic> purified ore with open hearth, <italic>Baring</italic> financed Kentucky coal. From this point to his death in 1893, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e DuPont\u2019s grandson Alfred DuPont became Louisville\u2019s wealthiest man through prosperous ventures including paper pulp production, city railway investments, and Kentucky coal mining.\nLikewise, the Great Lakes industrialized. When <italic>Cooke</italic> failed in the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Charlemagne Tower gained <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR\u2019s lands around the Great Lakes. Tower started as a lawyer for Alfred Munson, a fellow descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and Puritans, who directed <italic>Utica-Schenectady </italic>RR and <italic>Bank of Oneida</italic> in Upstate, New York. In 1871, Tower began buying mortgage secured <italic>Northern Pacific</italic> RR<italic> </italic>bond and replaced <italic>Wells Fargo</italic>\u2019s Ashbel Barney as a director in 1873. As <italic>Cooke</italic> failed in the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Tower exchanged depreciated bonds for land grants. By 1876, he held 105,000 acres along the route, including 65,000 in Minnesota and Dakota and 40,000 in Washington. \nIn 1881, Tower secured passage of a Minnesota mining tax law and founded <italic>Minnesota Iron Co</italic> with Edward Breitung. Born in German Schalkau, Breitung arrived in America in 1849, and settled in Marquette, Michigan. He entered the mining industry in 1864, opened <italic>Republic Mine</italic> in 1871, and began developing the Menominee Range in 1873. His son, Edward Jr, became director of <italic>Negaunee Iron Co</italic>, <italic>Arctic Iron Co</italic>, <italic>Wolverine Copper & Silver Co</italic>, and <italic>Marquette Savings Bank</italic>. \nBy then, Henry Villard\u2014formerly Heinrich Hilgard\u2014inaugurated a transcontinental connection from <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR in Portland, Oregon. Since Hilgard fled Germany, he began as a political and war correspondent. Representing Frankfurt investors seeking to mitigate losses on the West Coast from 1870, he acquired <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR via a blind pool in 1881.\nMeanwhile, silver magnates exercised their power. By 1880, Comstock Lode pioneer George Hearst acquired <italic>San Francisco Examiner</italic>, quickly bending it to his political will. Since <italic>Siemens</italic> laid a trans-Atlantic cable by 1879, Gould gained control of <italic>Western Union</italic> with <italic>Morgan</italic> funds by 1882, and Scrymser formed<italic> Mexican Telegraph </italic>and <italic>Central & South American Telegraph. </italic>So did, silver magnate and <italic>Bank of Nevada of San Francisco</italic> founder, John Mackay with <italic>New York Herald</italic> publisher Gordon Bennett in 1883. Likewise, <italic>Western Union</italic> disrupted communication in 1883 as telegraphs struck. Britain\u2019s <italic>Post Office</italic> deficit grew too. \nAs fears America would leave the gold standard grew, railroad credit fell. Silver and Western land prices increased amid UST inflation as gold flowed out of circulation. Since inflationist Democrats monetized silver with gold-unbacked USLTN in 1878, Republicans lobbied for protectionist tariffs, the first coming in March 1883. Credit tightened as European gold ran from the <italic>dollar</italic>. Silver monetization and improved Mexican transport led textiles vendor <italic>Guggenheim </italic>to smelt Mexican silver. Likewise, banks innovated non-metallic money. While New York banks accepted Chicago\u2019s grain elevator certificates by the 1870s, they avoided oil financing until <italic>Seaboard</italic> NB started in 1883 to lend on oil pipeline certificates. \nAs cheap transport supported a corn record in 1884, <italic>Erie</italic> dividends fell, <italic>Grant Ward</italic> failed and started correspondent runs from <italic>Marine</italic> NB for lending to <italic>Grant Ward</italic> on <italic>over</italic>certified checks. Two other banks with sketchy executives failed from runs. After reducing hours,<italic> COALA</italic> defaulted on a sub-HC dividend. As Vanderbilt bailed out Grant, NYCH quelled the run by pooling NYCH reserves to back loan certificates. \nSo, western SBs suspended payment and ran from MMSEC. With undeveloped capital markets for industrial securities, pools cooperated against competition. Panic worsened as Congress could not agree on federal bankruptcy law and prevented NBs from expanding banknotes. As state insolvency assignments to preferred creditors, race of diligent creditors felled businesses. While importers and manufacturers supported a federal process, Western merchants feared that Eastern creditors would seize assets upon default. \nThe <italic>Panic of 1884 </italic>further deflated commodity prices and credit, leading merchants and bankers to consolidate. Following the bankruptcy of rifle manufacturer <italic>Remington Arms</italic> in 1886, <italic>Hartley</italic> <italic>Graham</italic> took over the enterprise. Since supplying the Union during the Civil War, arms supplier <italic>Schuyler</italic> <italic>Hartley</italic> <italic>Graham</italic> reorganized as <italic>Hartley</italic> <italic>Graham </italic>following the retirement of Jacob Rensselaer Schuyler in 1876 and Marcellus Hartley\u2019s daughters married James Phelps Stokes and William Dodges\u2019 son by 1880. As the Boston Brahmin <italic>Adams Express</italic> suffered amidst the crisis, reflecting troubles of other California ventures.\nBy 1886, <italic>Great Northern</italic> RR\u2019s James Hill acquired control of New York\u2019s<italic> </italic><italic>Chase</italic> NB with Henry Cannon, who became President. A descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, Cannon was born on in Delhi, New York, and worked as a clerk and teller at <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>in Delhi</italic> and moved in 1870 to Saint-Paul, Minnesota, as teller at <italic>Second</italic> NB. Serving as Controller of the Currency from 1884, he resigned to become VP of NB <italic>of the Republic</italic>. Cannon\u2019s brother, James, began working at <italic>Fourth</italic> NB of New York in 1876 as a messenger and was later elected VP.\nLeading <italic>Lazard</italic> San Francisco from 1883, Marc Meyer incorporated <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1884 to lead the trans-Atlantic gold trade.<italic> </italic>That year, Isaac Seligman married the daughter of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Solomon Loeb. As Seligmans and Steinharts led <italic>Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>California Bank</italic>, their cousin-in-law Isaiah Hellman built <italic>Farmers & Merchants Bank</italic>. By 1890, Hellman took over Mackay\u2019s <italic>Bank of Nevada of San Francisco</italic>, later merging with <italic>Wells Fargo</italic>. He also directed other banks, railroads and public and private ventures in education, land development, water, electricity, oil, and wine.\nBy 1887, several of the Spiegelberg brothers-in-law of Seligman and co-owners of <italic>Second</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>New Mexico</italic> moved to New York and founded a merchant banker <italic>Spiegelberg</italic>. In New Mexico, meanwhile, Spiegelberg\u2019s former employees continued trading. After immigrating from Prussia in the late 1860s and working for the Spiegelbergs, the Jewish Bibo brothers sold corn to Fort Apache. In 1885, one brother married a granddaughter of Martin Valle, the governor or chief of the Acoma Pueblo, becoming chief himself in 1888.\nWhile Cincinnati-New York clothier Isaac Mack\u2019s second cousin married Philip Lehman in 1884, Marcus Goldman added his son Henry and son-in-law Ludwig Gallenberg (a <italic>Kuhn</italic> cousin-in-law) as junior partners of <italic>Goldman</italic> by 1885, and Marcus Goldman\u2019s niece married Isaac Mack\u2019s second cousin in 1889. Likewise, Philip\u2019s cousin\u2014Mayer\u2019s daughter\u2014married cloth manufacturer Morris Fatman in 1888, whose cousin married into the Rheims family connected to <italic>Lazard</italic> interests in France.\nSpreading north, West Virginia coal deflated anthracite and railroad stock. While Gould\u2019s <italic>Wabash</italic> filled for a receivership, <italic>COALA</italic> halted operations and issued scrip, spurring strikes and inflation. Although Pennsylvania banned scrip, state courts overturned the order in 1886. Like for <italic>Western Union</italic>, <italic>Singer</italic>, and Chicago\u2019s meatpackers, the Court upheld <italic>Wabash</italic>\u2019s federal inter-state reorgs in 1884. Although state courts allowed voluntary railroad debt reorgs, bond yields fell as the Court approved a reorg for <italic>Wabash</italic> RHC. \nIn 1884, <italic>Jeddo</italic>, among Pennsylvania\u2019s largest independent anthracite coal operators, kinterlinked with Estelle Robinson, daughter of deceased <italic>Drexel</italic> partner John Robinson and stepdaughter of <italic>Morgan</italic> partner James Wright. Since Vanderbilt launched <italic>South Pennsylvania</italic> RR with Carnegie and Rockefeller to counter <italic>Morgan</italic>-financed <italic>PENN</italic> in 1883, the conflict was settled in 1885, with Vanderbilt conceding <italic>South Pennsylvania</italic> to <italic>Morgan</italic> interests. After <italic>COALA</italic>\u2019s pool failed, <italic>Morgan</italic> gained control and issued HC bonds to buy competitors to stabilize prices. <italic>Morgan</italic> replaced <italic>COALA</italic>\u2019s CEO with Austin Corbin, whose conservation program sought to improve the system\u2019s physical condition and efficiency. \nBorn in Rhode Island, Corbin initially practicing law before shifting to banking in the 1850s. After the <italic>Civil War</italic>\u2019s NBA, he founded <italic>Corbin Bank </italic>in New York, amassing a fortune through his banking ventures. When his son fell ill, Corbin developed a Coney Island Beach hotel. He played a crucial role in developing Coney Island as a popular summer retreat for wealthy Christians, acquiring extensive land, building hotels, and establishing a new railroad system for this purpose. Subsequently, he focused on Long Island and its railways. <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Schiff refused to deal with <italic>COALA</italic> because of Corbin\u2019s public antisemitism. \nSince government contractor George Godfrey founded <italic>Mutual Union Telegraph.</italic> Against competition, Godfrey leased <italic>Mutual Union Telegraph</italic> to <italic>Western Union</italic> and became a partner in <italic>Schley</italic>, a <italic>Morgan</italic> affiliated brokerage. Clerking with for express money transfer operations since 1861, Grand Schley joined <italic>Morgan</italic>-affiliated<italic> First </italic>NB <italic>of New York</italic> as clerk in 1874 under the leadership of George Baker, he married Baker\u2019s daughter in 1879, and then left to form <italic>Schley</italic>. Along with adding Godfrey in 1885, <italic>Schley</italic> added Elverton Chapman, a son of a reverend from Freedonia, New York.\nAround <italic>Western Union</italic>\u2019s strike of 1883, trans-Atlantic cable competition grew with the entry of Irish-born silver mining magnate and founder of <italic>Bank of Nevada of San Francisco</italic>, John Mackay and <italic>New York Herald</italic> publisher Gordon Bennett. By 1886 Mackay\u2019s <italic>Commercial Cable </italic>began fighting Gould\u2019s <italic>Western Union</italic> monopoly on land. Reorganizing <italic>Baltimore & Ohio</italic> that year, <italic>Morgan</italic> sold her telegraphy to Gould\u2019s <italic>Western Union</italic>, and Gould and Macakay agreed not to compete. But more trans-Atlantic competitors and telephony fueled price wars. By 1887, investors developed West Virginia coal, <italic>Clark</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic> reorged <italic>COALB</italic>. \nSince Henry Villard turned <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR into a transcontinental railroad in 1883, he lost the control of the railroad<italic> </italic>during the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> closed her New York branch\u2014which started off as <italic>Ba</italic><italic>w</italic><italic>er</italic> before being replaced by future <italic>Deutsche</italic> co-founder Hermann Marcuse and his partners\u2014and <italic>Sullivan </italic>helped Villard keep his home. As Villard left for Germany, <italic>Deutsche</italic> named him her American agent from 1886. After 16 years of patent litigation, Charles Flint resigned from <italic>US Electric Lighting Co</italic>, which merged into <italic>Westinghouse</italic>\u2019s new electric enterprise along with other companies in 1886. \nAs <italic>Sprague</italic>\u2019s streetcars revolutionized inter-urban transport started during the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, she grew quickly across America from 1887. From 1887, <italic>Sprague</italic> street cars spread across America. While <italic>Lee</italic><italic> Higginson</italic>, Thomas Coolidge\u2014a descendant of President Thomas Jefferson and Boston Brahmin, Collidge later founded <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic>\u2014, and their Peabody and Gardner cousin-in-laws took over <italic>Thomson-Houston Electric Co</italic>,<italic> Deutsche</italic>, and worked with <italic>Morgan</italic> to take over <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR in 1887. By 1889, <italic>Sullivan </italic>advised Villard to buyout <italic>Edison</italic>, fusing patents with manufacturers into <italic>Edison</italic> with funding, <italic>Siemens</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and<italic> Rockefeller</italic>.\nSo, federal policy entered a new phase. After the Court allowed states to set regulated railroad rates with 1877\u2019s <italic>Munn</italic>, investment collapsed as railroads charged the low rates states set. While states increased rate caps from 1878, some over-chartered railroads to spur rate competition. As the Court federalized railroad regulation with<italic> Wabash</italic>, Congress enacted the <italic>Interstate Act of 1887</italic> (\u201cIA1887\u201d), and states repealed caps. IA1887 created the <italic>Interstate Commerce Commission</italic> (\u201cICC\u201d) to eliminate ruinous competition and assure railroads did not discriminate against localities. While IA1887 delegalized private pooling and undercutting, it stabilized cartel rates by policing cheats<italic>.</italic> Canals, railroads, and other <italic>commerce</italic> accelerated inter-state <italic>manufacturing</italic> trade. \nSince helping bring down the old <italic>Tammany Hall</italic>, Randolph Guggenheimer took control of his family\u2019s law firm, <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> and allied with New York\u2019s new Democratic Party, securing civic positions from 1887. Guggenheimer also added his Untermyer half-brothers to the firm. From 1888, Isaac and Samuel Untermyer promoted American companies in London, utilizing the press to garner attention. <italic>Blatchford </italic><italic>Seward DaCosta</italic> and Francis Stetson\u2014of future <italic>Davis Polk</italic>\u2014followed soon after. Failing to interest <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> in a mineral oil firm, Samuel Untermyer promoted Midwestern gran processors like C<italic>hicago & North Western </italic><italic>Granaries </italic>and <italic>Pillsbury-Washburn Flour Mills</italic> of Minnesota to British investors in 1889. The latter traded global grain, owning warehouses, grain elevators, flour mills, and <italic>Saint-Anthony Falls Water Power</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Morton </italic>New York closed the <italic>Pillsbury-Washburn </italic>transfer, Samuel Untermyer worked with the Chicago attorney to secure minority investors, including the brewer <italic>Worthington</italic> and the bankers <italic>Oppenheim</italic> of Cologne and <italic>Philippson Horwitz</italic> of Brussels. After serving in Congress and Ambassador to France, <italic>Morton</italic>\u2019s Levi Morton, a third cousin of Juliet Pierpont Morgan, became VP under President Harrison in 1889. Instead of government, other bankers kinterlinked into inter-state trade. After taking over a failing pharmaceutical company in 1887, William Bristol married a <italic>Clark</italic> cousin, and formed what became <italic>Bristol-Myers-Squib</italic>.\nAlready close with <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic> grew closer to <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic> interests. Serving as <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s American securities agent out of Boston, <italic>Blake </italic>kinterlinked through Quaker SBUS banker Jacob Barker with Joseph Wharton\u2014whose Quaker grandfather had married Abraham Redwood\u2019s granddaughter, a <italic>Hottinguer</italic> and <italic>Baring </italic>cousin, great-granduncle wed a <italic>Lloyd</italic> cousin\u2014by the 1840s. To head the London branch after 1874, <italic>Blake</italic> hired Emil Heinemann, a former New York merchant descended from an ennobled Germano-Dutch family, and a son-in-law of Henry Dabney, John Morgan\u2019s former partner. \nWhen Heinemann resigned to go independent in 1886, <italic>Blake</italic> hired A Boissevain in 1886 to form <italic>Blake</italic> <italic>Boissevain</italic> in London. The Huguenot <italic>Boissevain</italic> family of Amsterdam collaborated with <italic>Teixeira</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic>\u2019s Amsterdam agent until the 1930s. Often in collaboration, <italic>Blake</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic>, and <italic>Teixeira</italic> played a significant role in financing American railroads, particularly <italic>Union Pacific</italic> and <italic>Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Teixeira</italic> worked with Christians, including <italic>Forstall</italic> to reorg Louisiana\u2019s debt after the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>. And <italic>PENN</italic>, having depended on <italic>Morgan</italic> for financing since the 1870s, split financing among <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and <italic>Speyer</italic> by the 1890s.\nSince 1870, the whisky pool continued breaking as incentives to operate above production limits existed. So, the pool limited production by paying inefficient distilleries to suspend production while others worked at capacity. The pool transformed into <italic>WHISKY</italic> in 1887, becoming one of the five largest trusts, along with <italic>OIL </italic>and<italic> SUGAR</italic>. As these trusts amalgamated insolvent assets, state attorney generals sued to dissolve them, and courts refused to enforce trust agreements. At the same time, safe trust SBs spread. Unlike NBs, SBs could invest in real estate and did not have to hold reserves to pay out on-demand. \nAs Marshall Field and <italic>Armour</italic> founded <italic>Northern Trust</italic> in Chicago in 1889, New York required SBs to have five times as much capital\u2014held in UST bonds\u2014as NBs and enumerated investments rather than prudent diversification. As credit revived and silver fell, funds flowed from land to railroads. By then, gold discoveries in South Africa and Australia incited a colonial bank boom, which played a part in the collapse of <italic>Baring</italic> in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>.\nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, a New York clearing bank became illiquid after her Boston broker suspended. So, NYCH issued certificates. The crisis also allowed Gould to gain UPR and grow Virginia\u2019s <italic>Richmond</italic> via Chattanooga to Saint-Louis. As brokers <italic>Whitney</italic> of Boston and <italic>Decker Howell</italic> of New York collapsed, <italic>Sullivan </italic>created an orderly liquidation and reorg of troubled companies to delay creditors during market panics and await economic recovery. By 1891, <italic>Decker Howell</italic>\u2019s creditors received full compensation. Against <italic>over</italic>certifcation, NYCH forced NYSE to net trades with a<italic> </italic>clearinghouse in 1892. \nLikewise, in poor collections, tight credit, and losses on loans to Nashville borrowers contributed to a run from the largest FX and only Jewish bank of the city, <italic>Nashville Savings Bank</italic>, in 1891. Declining assistance, the bank suspended, and the Sax family left Nashville for New York shortly after the failure.\nAfter America\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic>, LA1866 limited commercial timber and mining operations in the Deep South until 1876. As LA1872 and LA1873 drove Southern timber and mining speculation, Southern Democrats convinced Congress to end federal coal land cash sales with LA1889. Interpreting the <italic>Constitution</italic>\u2019s <italic>Commerce Clause</italic> narrowly, the Court rejected federal <italic>WHISKY</italic> regulation. So, states retained commercial control using anti-trust without impeding the inter-state trade for <italic>Singer</italic>, <italic>Western Union</italic>, and <italic>Wabash</italic>. But as free trade crops deflated, inter-state monopoly inflation squeezed farmers. With IA1887 regulating railroads, the Court shifted <italic>Munn</italic>\u2019s public interest <italic>commerce</italic> control from states to courts for rate increases in March 1890. \nAs Western states sought to control commerce, Democrats called for an end to tariffs on raw materials, roads to forfeit land grants, and nationalizing railroads and telegraphs. Senator Sherman\u2019s compromise kept the protectionist tariff (\u201cTA1890\u201d) by adding the <italic> </italic>(\u201cAA1890\u201d). Since European cartelized global markets, TA1890 spurred consolidation to capture the tariff without foreign monopolies. \nCongress invented AA1890 to protect farmers and small businesses under TA1890. Instead of threatening non-large cartels and trusts, AA1890 promoted them. Alongside TA1890 and AA1890, Congress appeased farm and land debtor advocates for silver inflation with the <italic>Sherman Silver Purchase Act </italic>(\u201cSSPA\u201d). So, as UST issued redeemable notes to buy silver, creditors sold <italic>dollar</italic> debts and ran to gold. As TA1890 blocked imports Cuban, Hawaiian, and Philippine sugar, alcohol, tobacco, and abaca for cordage, supply chains collapsed.\nWith AA1890, Ohio, New York, and Nebraska commenced <italic>OIL</italic>, <italic>SUGAR</italic>, and <italic>WHISKY</italic> dissolutions. As <italic>OIL </italic>interlocked directors into a private association, <italic>SUGAR</italic> and other trusts consolidated in NYSE-financed inter-state mergers. Like bankers, industrialists drove these mergers with the counsel of lawyers. Of Portuguese descent, Philadelphia-born and <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic>-trained John DosPassos married a converted Hays cousin and specialized in corporate law. \nDosPassos supported Henry Havemeyer in forming <italic>SUGAR </italic>alongside<italic> Kidder</italic>. His legal acumen shielded the trust from legal challenges for years. As <italic>Sullivan </italic>maneuvered New Jersey to allow non-railroad HCs at lower taxes, <italic>Sullivan</italic> clients organized there. After reorganizing <italic>American Cotton Oil</italic> of Arkansas from 1884 as <italic>American Cotton Oil Co </italic>a HC with for sixteen companies incorporated in New Jersey by 1890, <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic>\u2019s Edward Adams became Chair and President, with <italic>Moore</italic> as a director. \n<italic>Moore</italic> was led by the Utica-born sons of banker and merchant Nathaniel Moore and the daughter of a fellow descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, George Beckwith, a banker of Triangle, New York, a descendant of Colonial Connecticut\u2019s Governor John Webster and an extended <italic>Clark</italic> cousin. After William Moore gained admission to the Wisconsin bar in 1872, he moved to Chicago and joined Edward Small\u2019s law firm. As William married Edward\u2019s daughter, his brother, Hobart, married her sister. \n<italic>Moore</italic> founded <italic>New York Biscuit</italic>, owning over twenty bakeries and outlets across ten eastern states. And in Chicago, lawyer Adolphus Green established <italic>American Biscuit Co</italic>, overseeing its forty bakeries. Eventually, the two reached an agreement to divide their operations geographically. Likewise, <italic>Moore</italic> founded <italic>MATCH</italic> in Connecticut, introducing safer production and strategically expanding operations. Within a year, <italic>Blatchford </italic><italic>Seward DaCosta</italic> helped form <italic>TOBACCO</italic>, which soon became one of the South\u2019s largest corporations.\n<italic>CORDAGE</italic> formed to amalgamate rope and twine manufacturers by raising funds through <italic>Belmont </italic>and <italic>Vermilye</italic>\u2019s William Read, in the latter\u2019s first industrial transaction.<italic> </italic>However, <italic>CORDAGE</italic> then issued securities to buy stakes in other companies like merging trusts but without <italic>Belmont</italic> and <italic>Vermilye </italic>or centralizing administration, ownership, or production.<italic> WHISKY</italic> became an HC out of Illinois and shuttered inefficient plants to reduce volumes. Having failed to grow <italic>US Electric Lighting Co</italic>, Charles Flint instead fused rubber shoe manufacturers into <italic>RUBBER</italic> to stabilize prices. By 1892, Ohio\u2019s federal court applied a <italic>rule of reason</italic> approach to AA1890, rejecting imprisonment of <italic>WHISKY</italic> executives by Massachusetts as free entry existed. In early 1893, Congress began investigating <italic>WHISKY</italic>. \nLikewise, tariffs and antirust spurred competition in mining. After the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, Charlemagne Tower\u2019s <italic>Minnesota Iron Co</italic> turned to Chicago bankers Marshall Field and Lazarus Silverman. Since partnering with Tower, Edward Breitung and his family continued to expand their iron interests. His son, Edward Jr, became director of <italic>Negaunee Iron Co</italic>, <italic>Arctic Iron Co</italic>, <italic>Wolverine Copper & Silver Co</italic>, and <italic>Marquette Savings Bank</italic>, affiliated with Samuel Kaufman, whose daughter he married in 1890. Kaufman\u2019s wife descended from Dutch Knickerbockers and the Medici cousin Flemish Coyman. Samuel\u2019s son Nathan had entered mining in 1883 after selling a retail business, developed the Blue Mine in 1885, and managed the Breitung estate and held executive roles in <italic>Washington Iron Mining Co</italic> and <italic>Negaunee Iron</italic>, and became President of <italic>Marquette Savings Bank</italic>. \nThey had significant competition in the Great Lakes. Investing in Ohio coal roads from the 1840s, Daniel Rhodes grew due to <italic>Ohio Life Insurance & Trust </italic>(\u201cOLIT\u201d), followed by his Quaker-Huguenot son-in-law, Marcus Converse Hanna. Mining Pennsylvania coal and Michigan iron, <italic>COALH</italic> fleets shipped the commodities across the Great Lakes by 1885. And <italic>Merritt</italic> found ore in a Great Lakes township, marking the start of Mesabi production, in 1890.\nGaining control of <italic>COALA</italic> in 1886, <italic>Morgan</italic> formed a pool to avoid competition in 1890. As <italic>COALA</italic> stabilized, <italic>Morgan</italic> allowed McLeod to manage her. McLeod merged to control anthracite until a New Jersey court blocked his monopoly. Complaints that old receivership laws favored bondholders grew. So, the Court reiterated that <italic>Wabash</italic> receiverships were constitutional in 1892. With rail associations failing to peg prices, McLeod and Gould resumed rate wars. While ICC stabilized rates since 1887, she could not halt wars as the Court weakened her cartel power in 1892. Like railroads, their suppliers also writhed. By the 1880s, <italic>Buckeye Steel Castings</italic> advanced more efficient railway couplers. However, confronted with challenges in capital raising and marketing, the company sold equity to <italic>OIL</italic> in 1892 to survive and grow.\nUnable to stabilize coal, McLeod began a <italic>Wabash</italic> receivership. After selling <italic>COALA</italic> stock to force McLeod out by May 1893, <italic>Morgan</italic> retook control of <italic>COALA</italic>.<italic> </italic>With Jay Gould having died in late 1892, <italic>Morgan</italic> stabilized railroad trade with <italic>Wabash</italic> receiverships. The <italic>Panic</italic> led to record railroad receiverships in 1893. Following the Court\u2019s 1892 decision, courts spurned old pro-bondholder receiverships. \nUsing equity receiverships and HC bonds, bankers integrated railroads. Receivers issued certificates for working capital and to pay off minority creditors. But courts only allowed <italic>commerce</italic> reorgs, such as railroads and telegraphs. Marriages also linked coal road interests. Since Estelle Robinson\u2014daughter of deceased <italic>Drexel</italic> partner John Robinson and stepdaughter of <italic>Morgan</italic> partner James Wright\u2014kinterlinked with <italic>Jeddo</italic>, among Pennsylvania\u2019s largest independent anthracite coal operators, amidst the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, her sister married John Conyngham of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, by 1895, whose father at one time controlled anthracite shipments over <italic>PENN</italic>.\nBy mid-1893, <italic>CORDAGE</italic> faltered. Without interstate bankruptcy options, <italic>Deering</italic> and other creditors from New Jersey to Illinois attached property and deflated collateral. In Chicago, Hermann Schaffner\u2014an extended cousin-in-law of the Greenbaum, Thalmann, Seligman, and Hellman families\u2014whose private bank <italic>Schaffner</italic> had shifted from commercial paper to financing speculative ventures in street railways and real estate, committed suicide, triggered a run from Scotch banks. \nFrom <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings Bank</italic>, failures spread as <italic>Missouri</italic> NB collapsed, followed by <italic>Wisconsin Marine & Fire Insurance C</italic><italic>o</italic><italic> Bank</italic>. As pools collapsed, investors ran from stocks, and depositors ran from banks. As business failures and bank runs spread, Colorado\u2019s governor decried the Eastern gold monopoly against inflationary silver. While UST supported convertibility and allowed more railroad bond collateral, Congress repealed SSPA by November. \nAfter NYCH extended loan certificates in October, she allowed banks to print and circulate currency without paying SB bank note taxes. Banks were hesitant to appear weak but, after<italic> </italic><italic>Morgan</italic> who took the first step, others followed. Morgan also made UST collateral loans and led poor relief. Likewise, the Rockefellers acquired <italic>Citi</italic> NB. As coal deflation spread to iron, the Great Lakes particularly suffered. Failing to merge with <italic>Minnesota Iron Co</italic>, <italic>Merritt</italic> was forced to sell control to <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s Rockefeller in early 1894. With the collapse of <italic>Cudahy</italic>\u2019s pork and lard corner on<italic> Chicago Board of Trade</italic>, <italic>Saint-Paul German-American Bank</italic> and Lazarus Silverman of Chicago failed. \nThe <italic>Panic of 1893</italic> also ended <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic>\u2019s and <italic>Blatchford Seward DaCosta\u2019</italic>s practice of promoting American companies in London, and shifted to trusts in America. Throughout the 1890s, <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> attracted clients including theater owners and manufacturers. By 1894, <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> added Louis Marshal as a named partner. While Marshal and Maurice Untermyer married two Lowenstein sisters, a third sister married reformist Rabbi Judah Magnes. An associate of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Jacob Schiff, the San Francisco-born Magnes later led 150 thousand Jews to protest Russia\u2019s 1905 pogroms and raise money for self-defense before moving to Israel and co-founding <italic>Hebrew</italic> <italic>Uni </italic>with Albert Einstein by 1920.  Still, Kuhn remained a client of <italic>Blatchford Seward DaCosta</italic>, which <italic>Kuhn</italic> heir Felix Gernsheim joined in 1898, but remained only briefly.\nOvertime, the cousinhood reorganized. In Chicago, <italic>Schaffner</italic>\u2019s brother-in-law, Abraham Becker\u2014unrelated to the Christian co-founder to <italic>Rothschild</italic> affiliated <italic>Becker Fuld</italic>\u2014founded <italic>Becker</italic>, and resumed focus on commercial paper from 1894. Since starting <italic>Levi</italic> denim jeans during the <italic>Gold Rush</italic> his brother-in-law David Stern, Levi Strauss ran <italic>Levi</italic> until his death, when his nephews and their descendants assumed control. While one of David Stern\u2019s sons married Marc Meyer\u2019s daughter in 1892, their siblings married within a year. \nHowever, as confidence in America\u2019s <italic>dollar</italic> fell with the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, Meyer left California to join Alexandre Weill at <italic>Lazard</italic> New York. Likewise, Elkan Naumburg, who immigrated from Bavaria in 1850, settled in Baltimore, and became a director of <italic>National Citizens\u2019 Bank</italic> in New York. His son Walter graduated from <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1889 and joined clothing firm <italic>Naumburg Kraus Lauer</italic>. While the Lauers kinterlinked with Phillip Lehman, NYSE broker Albert Goodhart, and, after the firm dissolved in the <italic>Panic of </italic><italic>1893</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic> cousin Seasongood, the Naumburgs started <italic>Naumburg</italic><italic> </italic>bank. As his first cousin once removed married Joseph Proskauer, <italic>Naumburg</italic> expanded in commercial paper business.\nGuggenheim silver smelters heirs kinterlinked with a Seligman banker in 1894 and Seligman\u2019s cousin, Southwest trader Spiegelberg, out of New York in 1897. Guggenheim cousins from Bavaria, brothers Henry and Max Guggenheim Morgenthau immigrated to America in the 1860s. While Max co-founded <italic>Hudson Realty Co</italic><italic> </italic>in 1893 with department store heir Joseph Bloomingdale, Henry lawyered. \nMoreover, the <italic>Panic of 1893 </italic>bound Boston Brahmin bankers as <italic>Kidder</italic> promoted Robert Winsor to partner in 1894. Winsor, who began as a clerk in 1880, had a father who was a third cousin twice removed of Warren Delano and mother was the daughter of Unitarian Reverend Henry Ware, a founder of <italic>Harvard</italic> Divinity. While one of Henry Ware\u2019s sons followed in his footsteps as a reverend and divinity professor, two others pursued careers in medicine. One of them taught at <italic>Harvard</italic>, and another married Elizabeth Cabot Lee, whose brother and brother-in-law founded <italic>Lee</italic>.\nNarrowly interpretating the <italic>Commerce Clause</italic> in 1895, the Court supported <italic>SUGAR </italic>against DOJ. While the decision fostered mergers, few achieved a monopoly to fix prices. Before Illinois\u2019 court ruled on <italic>WHISKY</italic>, the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic> and UST increased real federal spirits taxes. As the inflation attracted competition, <italic>WHISKY</italic> filed for receivership in 1895. Imitators followed, but none succeeded. Unable to get a <italic>Wabash</italic>-style equity receivership, <italic>CORDAGE</italic>\u2019s creditors forced another reorg. \nMeanwhile, European immigrants\u2014particularly Jews fleeing Russian pogroms\u2014continued to flock to mines for work. Although the Court\u2019s <italic>Munn</italic> decision had allowed localities to sue in court, it did not extend to unions or other unincorporated associations. Congress empowered the President to arbitrate strikes. President Cleveland\u2019s only use ignored the governor to order the <italic>National Guard</italic> into Illinois. Instead, DOJ sued only <italic>LABOR</italic> under AA1890 as strikers protested wage decreases from 1893 to 1895. Unlike Pennsylvania\u2019s anthracite cities, isolated bituminous coal mine communities resembled plantations. \nFrom Alabama to Illinois since 1870, collieries leased Black convicts during strikes. Ending militia subsidies in 1891, Tennessee banned direct prisoner leases to mines in 1896. Still, <italic>COALT</italic> imported coal mined by convicts in Georgia and elsewhere. As <italic>LABOR</italic> won wage increases in 1897, prisoners paved roads and mined Southern coal. Since LA1889\u2019s ending of federal coal land sales did not extend to <italic>Indian Territories</italic>, they opened frontier lands. As Gould and <italic>COALA</italic> interests ran to develop Oklahoma coal, <italic>OIL</italic> followed as oil drilling started. Still, immigrant labor followed the job booms. But when strikes spread in 1894, the <italic>Territories</italic> called Congress for aid. By 1898, Congress extended LA1889 to the <italic>Territories\u2019</italic> coal and oil.\nRefusing to cut TA1890 tariffs after strikes, TA1894 taxed income. But the Court required an amendment unpassed until 1913. With legal advice from Francis Stetson of future-<italic>Davis Polk</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic> led <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Belmont</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> in European UST bond syndicate to raise gold and stabilize the <italic>dollar</italic> in 1895. When <italic>Lazard</italic> withdrew funds from UST to meet obligations, concerns arose that the syndicate had dissolved, prompting the participants to reassure the public of their commitment to sustaining the gold reserve and maintaining <italic>dollar</italic> convertibility. However, the gold standard reduced support for the monetization of silver and deflated American land values. This situation fueled antisemitic conspiracy theories among silverites, who blamed the Rothschilds and other Jewish bankers for manipulating the financial system to harm ordinary Americans. \nSince <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s FX specialist and <italic>Speyer</italic> cousin Eug\u00e8ne Mehler died in 1893, Frankfurt-born George Blumenthal joined his cousins at <italic>Speyer</italic> New York and made partner before transitioning to <italic>Lazard</italic> New York. By 1896, he led negotiations with <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Morgan, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Schiff, <italic>Belmont</italic>, and <italic>Hoffman</italic> to refinance UST debt.\nLosing trust in Henry Villard as her American agent, <italic>Deutsche</italic> replaced him in 1893 with Edward Adams, John Morgan\u2019s cousin-in-law, who resigned from <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic> for the new role, reorganized <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR, and negotiated<italic> Deutsche</italic>\u2019s purchase of UST debt in 1896. By 1899, Blumenthal married Marc Meyer\u2019s daughter, kinterlinking <italic>Speyer</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic>.\nAlthough John Morgan\u2019s son Jack surprised him with marriage to a Boston Brahmin classmate at <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1890, it was a marriage for love with little strategic value. Since <italic>Drexel </italic>appointed Bremen Consul John Harjes in 1868 to represent the firm in Paris and Junius Morgan in London by 1871, Anthony Drexel\u2019s sons did not want to take over management of the bank when he died in 1893. So, <italic>Drexel</italic> and <italic>Harjes</italic> soon fused into <italic>Morgan</italic>. As <italic>Morgan</italic> hired his Burns and Drexel in-laws and hired partners to function as family units. \nAs John Morgan\u2019s daughter married Pierson Hamilton, Pierson and his cousin George Bowdin\u2014both descendants of inaugural UST Secretary Alex Hamilton and connected to <italic>Prime</italic>\u2014became partners. In London, Burns\u2019 daughter married the aristocrat Viscount Lewis Harcourt. <italic>Morgan</italic> did not have any Jewish partners before WWII or share kinship links with any Jewish bank until the 1930s (and then only through Christians). \nSince silver magnate George Hearst acquired <italic>San Francisco Examiner</italic> in 1880, his son William Hearst was expelled from <italic>Harvard</italic>, and took control of <italic>Examiner</italic> by 1887, and transformed it to mirror Joseph Pulitzer\u2019s <italic>New York World</italic>. His aggressive tactics, sensational coverage, and manufactured news led to the <italic>Examiner\u2019s</italic> profitability by 1890. The younger Hearst soon found a silver proponent to support.\nIn 1896, Democratic Presidential Candidate William Bryan charged that debt-burdened farmers were being crucified upon a \u201c<italic>Cross of Gold</italic>\u201d for not being able to pay off their loans with silver. The pro-debtor Populists linked bankruptcy law, (deflationary) gold standard, and immigration as the scourges of the laborer. While Bryan\u2019s policies scared away William Whitney, a former supporter of Democrat Cleveland\u2019s presidency, <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB\u2019s President William Saint-John advocated for the restoration of silver and its unlimited coinage.\nConcerns about free silver led to the <italic>Panic of 1896</italic>. As <italic>Moore</italic>\u2019s <italic>MATCH</italic> reported as $8 million in losses, later cut in half with a financial reorg. But as <italic>MATCH</italic>\u2019s debacle weakened <italic>New York Biscuit</italic>, Green and <italic>American Biscuit Co</italic> cut prices, causing <italic>New York Biscuit</italic>\u2019s shares to fall by 20%. While William Moore resigned from <italic>New York Biscuit</italic>, the price war effects were limited since retailers could not hoard baked products. <italic>MATCH</italic> also recouped with Bryan\u2019s loss. One reason was global gold inflation. Discoveries of gold in South Africa and the use of cyanide for extraction from ore increased gold generally, while America\u2019s suspension during the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic> pulled in specie. As <italic>MATCH</italic> began acquiring European companies by the summer of 1896, <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB\u2019s President William Saint-John was forced to resign in 1896 and died shortly after.\nSince <italic>Paribas</italic> founded <italic>Banamax</italic><italic> </italic>in 1881, <italic>Banamax</italic> received a railroad concession in 1884, and Cassel and <italic>Kuhn</italic> funded construction of <italic>Mexican Central </italic>RR. Starting with the formation of <italic>London Bank of Mexico </italic>in 1889, <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic> converted her foreign branches into locally incorporated banks and retained shareholdings, shifting toward functioning as an investment trust. After three banks merged into <italic>Banco de Chile</italic> and operated with links to the Chilean government in 1893, <italic>London Bank</italic>\u2019s Lima branch merged with <italic>Callao</italic> to form <italic>London Bank of Peru </italic>in 1897. <italic>London Bank</italic> also acquired positions in <italic>Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires</italic>, <italic>Banco de la Habana Cuba</italic>, <italic>Banco Agricola Comercial San Salvador</italic>, <italic>Banco de la Nacion Boliviana</italic>, and <italic>Banco Espa\u00f1ol de Chile</italic>.\nSince Peru defaulted on her debt during the <italic>War of the Pacific</italic> in 1879, foreign trade on the West Coast shifted from Peru to Chile. In 1889, Peru and a London-based bondholders\u2019 syndicate formed <italic>Peruvian Corp</italic> to manage railroads and other state assets in exchange for cancellation of external debt. From then, elite families and financiers in Lima developed financial autonomy, blocked foreign monopoly proposals like <italic>Banco Privilegiado</italic>, and diversified into banking, insurance, and agro-export, particularly sugar and cotton. \nAfter the war ended in 1883, Peruvian banker <italic>Callao</italic> faced several runs as other banks failed through the <italic>Panic of 18</italic><italic>8</italic><italic>9</italic>. Cuban financier Jose Payan and Spanish merchant Jose Mendoza led the board. In 1897, <italic>Callao</italic> merged with <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic>\u2019s Lima branch to form <italic>London Bank of Peru</italic>. Payan soon masterminded institutions such as <italic>Recaudadora</italic>, <italic>Caja de Dep</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>sitos</italic>, <italic>Estancos</italic> (for alcohol, tobacco, cocaine, and salt) that served as elite-controlled semi-public enterprises that absorbed state revenues. Likewise, in Colombia, free banking ended in 1886, as the government prohibited private currency issuance and strengthened <italic>Banco Nacional</italic> while private bankers and directors of regional banks continued to kinterlink.\nMeanwhile, <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic>\u2019s local branch reorganized as a Mexican corporation to include expatriate French financiers, and electing Thomas Braniff as its president. Born in New York to Irish immigrants, Braniff ventured to California during the <italic>Gold Rush </italic>before constructing railroads in Mexico in the 1850s. Becoming construction superintendent of <italic>Mexico City-Veracruz</italic> RR, Braniff steadily climbed the ranks, becoming the general manager and later a director of the railway. Along with marrying a well-born French-Canadian wife, he maintained a close friendship with President D\u00edaz.\nAlthough Cassel negotiated a large loan for Mexican loan in 1893, the local Government subsequently rejected his plans. While Mexico reorganized debt with <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, and <italic>Dresdner </italic>in 1896, Cassel and <italic>Paribas</italic> continued to invest in railroads. President D\u00edaz also continued to support Thomas Braniff, who diversified across Mexico\u2019s manufacturing and financial industries beyond <italic>London Bank of Mexico</italic>, and his children served as directors and married strategically. As one son married the VP of <italic>Banco Hipotecario</italic>, others married elites and plantation owners. After Thomas died, his widow and eldest son, managed his holdings, working closely with <italic>Paribas</italic>. Soon after, Thomas\u2019 daughter married Spanish noble Luis Bermejillo, Marquis of Mohernando, with ties to the entrepreneurial Bermejillo family and the founding of <italic>Catholic Party</italic>. \nA year after Enrique Creel co-founded <italic>Banco Mexicano Refaccionario</italic> in 1898, the bank evolved into <italic>Banco Central Mexicano</italic> (\u201cBCM\u201d). Backed by <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Morgan</italic>, BCM aimed to unify Mexico\u2019s currency as a clearinghouse for state banks. Despite guaranteeing state banknotes and serving as a financial agent, BCM\u2019s inability to issue banknotes limited her effectiveness. \nBorn in Mexico to an American father and Mexican mother, Creel managed cattle, banking, manufacturing, and mining ventures for his father-in-law Luis Terrazas of Chihuahua, who owned extensive land. By 1882, Creel co-founded <italic>Banco Minero Chihuahuense</italic>. Creel, often likened to John Morgan, was a key figure in finance and industry, serving as Governor of Chihuahua from 1904 to 1910, Ambassador to America, and Secretary of Foreign Relations.\nAs France increased her Mexican presence, Anglo-German financiers risked being sidetracked. <italic>Salomon</italic>, among the most prominent Mexican oil financiers, was founded by <italic> </italic>Haim Salomon\u2019s Alabama-born great-grandson William Salomon, a cousin of the Hendricks and Hart families, worked closely with <italic>Speyer</italic>. By 1904, <italic>Salomon</italic> hired Elisha Walk, a Christian born in New York to London merchants. Walk studied at <italic>Yale</italic> and MIT before joining <italic>Fisk </italic>in 1902 until 1904, when he married the daughter of a Martinque sugar planter descended from French aristocrat, and moved to <italic>Salomon</italic>, where he developed his oil financing acumen.\nAlong with reforming silver in 1904, Mexico\u2019s issued debt via <italic>Speyer</italic> New York, <italic>Speyer</italic> London, <italic>Speyer</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, <italic>Teixeira</italic> of Amsterdam, and <italic>Banco Nacional de M\u00e9xico</italic> to buy controlling interests in <italic>Southern</italic> RR and <italic>Veracruz & Pacific</italic> RR and to fund public works at Coatzacoalcos, Salina Cruz, Veracruz, and Manzanillo ports. Before that, European banks also bought American assets. In 1897, the financial challenges of <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR prompted incorporation in Amsterdam led by <italic>Speyer</italic>\u2019s affiliate <italic>Teixeira</italic>. Concurrently, the reorg involved firms such as <italic>Speyer</italic> New York, <italic>Speyer</italic> London, <italic>Speyer</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>Teixeira</italic>, and <italic>Deutsche</italic>, before selling <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR to <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Northern Pacific</italic> RR in 1899.\nSince the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, the Court shifted states\u2019 <italic>commerce</italic> rate-setting powers to courts and limited ICC\u2019s rate-setting ability. However, uncertainty grew after the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic> until 1898, when the Court ruled in UPR\u2019s favor. <italic>Smyth v Ames </italic>restored <italic>Munn</italic> for <italic>commerce</italic>. So fair market value profits alleviated rate wars in the public interest. Congress resolved inter-state insolvency chaos with the <italic> </italic>(\u201cBA1898\u201d). Over Democrat\u2019s SSPA and Republican\u2019s BA1898, western states had supported temporary debt discharges. \nFocusing on individuals and medium-sized companies, not railroads, corporations, and NBs, state insolvency litigation fell as debtor-friendly BA1898 streamlined debt collection for inter-state investment. Against<italic> </italic>runs to collect, petitions triggered automatic stays. Instead of BA1867\u2019s focus on illiquidity, BA1898 refocused on insolvency as liabilities exceeding assets. BA1898 permitted involuntary procedures against farmers and laborers. BA1898 allowed discharge to reorg going concern debt or liquidate assets. To expand access, BA1898 limited British judicial discharge reviews.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>International Panics at the turn of 20</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> Century </italic>\u2013 Part I\nWhile Christian Greeks and Armenians continued to dominate Turkish financial services, they lost influence to <italic>TURK</italic>. <italic>TURK</italic> suffered a loss since Turkey defaulted on her Russian war debts in the <italic>Panic of 1878</italic>. Local investors were the hardest hit. Following the failure of <italic>Baltazzi</italic>, <italic>Ede</italic>, <italic>Hava</italic>, <italic>Rodocanachi</italic>, and other Chiot banker cousin-in-laws in 1881, Turkish financial reforms<italic> </italic>confined Armenians to small-scale banking and other intermediary roles. Serving as the personal banker of Sultan Abdul II Ottoman, Hagop Zarifi bought a 45,000-hectare estate in Baghdad, Iraq, that he introduced irrigation and modern agriculture technology.\nBy the 1830s, their Chiot cousins <italic>Ralli</italic> established branches in London, Marseilles, Manchester, Odessa, and Constantinople. In 1837, <italic>Ralli</italic> expanded into Persian Tabriz to import silk. In 1860, <italic>Ralli</italic> opened new offices opened in Bombay, Karachi, and New Orleans, linked through London and Liverpool cotton industry. That year <italic>Ralli</italic> installed steam-powered cotton gins in Egypt. In Persia, <italic>Ralli</italic> worked with <italic>Hajj</italic>. \nBorn in Isfahan in the 1830s into a family with a long history in trade, the Hajj family was forced to work after the patriarch filed for bankruptcy in the 1850s. Amin moved to Tehran to trade with relatives<italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>Amin soon accumulated enough capital to bring his family to Tehran and invest in exporting wool to Europe through <italic>Ralli</italic>. In 1857, Amin formed <italic>Hajj</italic>, a partnership with his brother Abu, an Azeri merchant, and a banker in Isfahan facilitating trade through Tehran, Tabriz, and Constantinople. \nFrom 1863, Abu married the banker\u2019s daughter and <italic>Hajj</italic> became <italic>Ralli</italic>\u2019s agent for Iran and Turkey. As his brothers soon acted as his agents in Constantinople and Marseilles. <italic>Hajj</italic> officers and agents spread from the Middle East to Western Europe, Russia, India, America, and the Far East. In Persia, <italic>Hajj</italic> competed with foreign companies in importing goods, including luxury for the royal family, government armaments, and acquiring land in the Caspian Sea, Kirman, and Yazd. <italic>Hajj</italic> rapidly became the wealthiest and most influential merchants in Persia.\nAfter silkworm disease destroyed the Persian silk trade, <italic>Ralli</italic> closed her Tabriz branch in 1871, followed by the closures of the Constantinople and Trebizond branches that depended on it. She withdrew from the Levant and transferred the Russian grain trade to her Scaramanga cousins, as the Jewish traders expanded inland through their family networks and rising American grain competed from across the Atlantic. Ralli redirected her operations toward India, East Asia, and Africa, and established <italic>Ralli</italic> New York.\nSo, Hajj gained prominence as a money changer in Tehran from the 1870s. Of greater significance, <italic>Ralli</italic>\u2019s need for credit to finance provincial export commodities purchases led to rapid expansion. Because much of their borrowing was based on state revenues, this provided Amin with important contacts in the Court. So, when Austrian advisor Pechan arrived in Persia in 1879 to reform currency and modernize the mint, he appointed Amin to oversee mint operations and initiate currency reform efforts.  \nBut as electricity demanded copper, metal and electricity reorganized, accelerating banker marriages. In 1878, the head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt\u2019s daughter, wed Maximilian Goldschmidt, whose sister was married to Maurice Hirsch. Since Maurice\u2019s brother Joseph married a Ladenburg\u2014a cousin of the Goldschmidts, Speyers, and Halphens\u2014in 1868, he was promoted to <italic>Bayerische Vereinsbank</italic>\u2019s Board. After <italic>Beer</italic> split off in 1872 from <italic>Cohen-Barent</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>, several Mertons married a Katz-cousin <italic>Rapha\u00ebl </italic>heiress and Katz-descendant Waley, a cousin of Cohen-Barent, Rothschild, and Samuel. \nCousin William Merton\u2014the product of the earlier marriage of Ralph Merton and Phillip Cohen-Barent\u2014became a banker at <italic>Merton</italic> London and married a <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Frankfurt heiress in 1877. Since Ladenburg kinterlinked with Manchester cloth trader Jacob Behrens in 1844, their son wed a Warburg in 1879. As <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Frankfurt heir Adolf started <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic> in New York, the firm<italic> </italic>acted as an agency for the Merton\u2019s <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>, expanding from Harz lead to trading European metals, American copper, and Dutch Indies tin. \n<italic>Ladenburg</italic> became <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s grain agent in London and New York from the 1880s. By 1884, Adolf Ladenburg married the daughter of New York banker Alex Stevens, a great-nephew of former <italic>Bank of Commerce</italic>\u2019s John Ledyard Stevens and descendant of former UST Secretary Albert Gallatin.\nMeanwhile, <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> incorporated in 1881. After buying Prussian brass works in 1863 and marrying a Katz-Auerbach descendant a year later, <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen </italic>co-found <italic>London Metal Exchange</italic> as the only foreigner member in 1882. Another Jewish co-founder <italic>London Metal Exchange</italic><italic> </italic>was metal merchant Lewis Lazarus, whose son had married a granddaughter of Chief Rabbi of Britain Nathan Adler.\nEarlier, <italic>Mitteldeutsche Credit</italic> co-founder <italic>Sulzbach</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>Nationalbank</italic> of Berlin, <italic>Lando</italic> of Breslau, <italic>Bayerische Vereinsbank</italic> co-founder <italic>Guggenheimayer </italic>of Munich, and several others funded Emil Rathenau. A Jewish engineer from a Berlin textile family and a cousin-in-law of Oppenheim cousins, Rathenau had married a Speyer cousin. Likewise, a daughter of <italic>Lando</italic>\u2019s Jacob Lando had married Ludwig Asser Kaufmann, a baptized second great grandson of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, a nephew-in-law of <italic>Oppenheim </italic>Cologne, and nephew-in-law of  Cologne-born Robert Esser, who soon chaired <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>and <italic>Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Bodenkreditbank</italic>, and served on the boards of thirteen others, including <italic>Dresdner</italic>.\nIn 1883, Rathenau partnered with the Junker Christian inventor Werner Siemens and his cousin led <italic>Deutsche</italic>, to lease <italic>Edison</italic>\u2019s patents and create <italic>German Edison</italic>. <italic>Siemens</italic> incorporated in 1880 in London, functioning independently from Germany and Russia. Since establishing a French office in 1879, <italic>Siemens</italic> later retreated due to <italic>Schneider</italic> by 1886. In 1884, <italic>German Edison</italic> became independent from <italic>Siemens</italic>, and with funding from <italic>Deutsche</italic> and <italic>Berliner</italic>, formed <italic>German General Electric </italic>(\u201cGGE\u201d) in 1887. Meanwhile, <italic>Siemens</italic> expanded Russian electricity operations. \nWhile <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Berliner</italic>, and <italic>Lippma</italic><italic>n</italic><italic>n Rosenthal</italic> took up Russian state loans, pogroms led <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic>, <italic>Becker Fuld</italic>, and other Dutch Jewish bankers to boycott Russia. Of unknown relation to <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic>, Amsterdam-born Julius Wertheim Gans established <italic>Gans</italic> in 1883. The stock brokerage acted as an agent for <italic>Huilier</italic> of Paris and <italic>Pinto Oppenh</italic><italic>y</italic><italic>m</italic> of London, trading primarily in foreign assets, Dutch state bonds, and shares in shipping and East Indies companies. \nFrom 1889, <italic>Gans</italic> transformed into <italic>Mendes Gans</italic> by partnering with Isaac Cah\u00e9n Mendes. Connected to DaCosta and Teixeira on his father\u2019s side, Mendes\u2019 mother was a niece of Joseph Cah\u00e9n, and so a cousin of the Bischoffsheim, Camondo, Morpurgo, Reinach, Rothschild, and Warshavsky families. In 1891, a third cousin of Mendes\u2019 mother, Dutch tobacco merchant and banker Frederik Pressburger Philips, founded <italic>Philips</italic> for his engineer son to manufacture lamps in Eindhoven, Netherlands. The company faced competition from German firms but soon grew in Britain. Likewise, <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Norddeutsche</italic> invested in <italic>Bary Michaelis</italic> to establish an Antwerp presence. \nIn 1886, Charles Hall\u2019s electrolysis process advanced smelting and allowed aluminum refining at scale. Within a year, Swiss steel and electro-mechanics firms, including <italic>Escher Weiss</italic> and <italic>Oerlikon</italic>, formed <italic>Schweizerische Metallurgische</italic>, which<italic> </italic>joined with GGE and <italic>Berliner</italic> to establish <italic>Aluminum Industrie </italic>by 1888<italic>. ALUM</italic> and <italic>Aluminum </italic>strategically pursued scale and scope to cut production costs. Likewise, <italic>Mellon Bank</italic> financed<italic> Pittsburgh Reduction Co </italic>(later ALCOA, \u201c<italic>ALUM</italic>\u201d), backed by engineers from the Pittsburgh. \nAs American tariffs and deflation attracted direct investment, <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>, <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen,</italic> and <italic>Beer</italic> opened refineries from 1887. While <italic>Merton</italic> and <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann </italic>funded <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> America<italic> </italic>under the leadership of their cousin, <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic>\u2019s Ludwig Vogelstein, the son of a leading German reform rabbi, immigrated to open <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic> America after denied a partnership in Germany. \nIn Britain, another enterprise started. After Prussia defeated Bavaria in 1866, Hugo Hirsch\u2014likely unrelated to the other Hirsches\u2014fled to London. By 1886, he joined another Bavarian to supply standard wholesale electric accessories. Within a year, they produced Britain\u2019s first complete electric catalogue and formed the unincorporated <italic>British</italic> <italic>General Electric </italic>(\u201cBGE\u201d). Like his partner, Hugo anglicized his surname to Hirst, and converted to Anglicanism. \nWhile Protestants played a greater role in heavy industry, they also kinterlinked with bankers and traders. During the <italic>Franco-Prussian War</italic>, <italic>Krupp</italic>\u2019s steel cannons proved superior to the French bronze cannon and grew the firm. Expanding into cannon production in 1859, <italic>Krupp</italic> had adopted the Bessemer process in 1862, and acquired mines and ironworks to secure resources. As an extended Krupp cousin, Johann Bunge\u2019s grandson married the Koenigs nephew of <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> co-founder Gustav Mevissen in 1872, <italic>Krupp</italic> acquired some of Mevissen\u2019s coal fields after the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>. \nBack in 1818, Bunge founded <italic>Bunge</italic> in Amsterdam to trade Dutch colonial goods while his brother remained in Westphalia, becoming a Lutheran pastor and marrying a Krupp. Bunge\u2019s nephew Carlos served as Consul General of Prussia and the Netherlands. By 1884, Carlos\u2019 grandson, Edouard, moved to Argentina and established <italic>Bunge</italic> to focus on grain exports. As the Messivens were ennobled in 1884, their Styn-in-laws absorbed their in-law\u2019s <italic>Herstatt </italic>after a death left the bank leaderless in 1888, and, in the 1890s, two great nieces of Mevissen\u2019s wife married two <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> cousins of Hamburg.\nBefore France implemented tariffs, her banks focused on foreign direct investment. From 1875, <italic>Rothschild </italic>Paris invested in global assets, the family\u2019s only branch to do so due to national laws. <italic>Comptoir</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> funded <italic>Indochine</italic> to develop French Southeast Asia. Having co-founded <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, Swiss Huguenot \u00c9douard Hentsch led <italic>Comptoir</italic> from 1872 and became the first president of <italic>Indochine </italic>while his brother led Ernest <italic>Hentsch</italic> from 1879. With investment from <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> in 1881, <italic>Indochine </italic>branched to Hong Kong and beyond to become the French bank in China.\nIn domestic industry since the <italic>Franco-Prussian War of 1870</italic>, Catholics, Huguenots, and Jews followed separate paths. Marriages within Alsace-Lorraine\u2019s native bourgeoisie, such as the Christian iron magnates Dietrich and Schlumberger remained endogamous, aligning with pre-existing Huguenot social circles and cultural ties. In contrast, intermarriages with immigrant Germans were infrequent among the bourgeoisie were less common relative to workers and lower-ranking clerks. \nWhile the Huguenots kinterlinked with one another until their lines homogenized, the Catholic Seilli\u00e8re only married nobles after being ennobled by Napoleon. In the 1860s, <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic> kinterlinked with a descendant of French Court Banker Jean-Joseph Laborde\u2014and so his aristocrat and Huguenot banker descendants\u2014and continued to invest in supplying wood and clothing to the French army, <italic>Schneider</italic>\u2019s <italic>Creusot</italic>, wool mills, French railways, negotiating bills of exchange, and, to a lesser extent, foreign ventures. \nAs German banks sought to purchase <italic>Creuset</italic> forges of Lorraine, the Wendel refused and formed a multinational companies. As Fran\u00e7ois founded a firm in 1871 to maintain French presence, his brother Henri became a German citizen but married an ennobled Berthe Thellusson Vaulserre, becoming brother in-law of Beauce landowner Grandet and <italic>Martell</italic> cognac owner Firino and cousin-in-law of Catholic banker Charles Demachy. \nThe son of the French royal stockbroker from the 1820s, Demachy had joined <italic>Creuset</italic> in 1836, married a Thellusson cousin, and became <italic>Seilli\u00e8re </italic>Senior Partner by 1857. After their son married Jeanne Oppenheim Ratisbonne Sourdeval in 1874, her aunt\u2019s niece-in-law married the son of Ernest Go\u00fcin and Anna Rodrigues. In 1879, Wendel, with support from <italic>Demachy</italic> <italic>Seilli\u00e8re </italic>and<italic> </italic>her <italic>Creuset</italic> co-owner, <italic>Schneider</italic>, acquired the British <italic>Thomas</italic> steel patent for Lorraine and built factories. By 1882, <italic>Wendel</italic> established a subsidiary across the new border in France with <italic>Schneider</italic> and <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic>, making the company binational. While Seilli\u00e8re withdrew from the bank, Wendel invested, and the families continued to intermarry. Likewise, the Thellussons with relatives of the kinterlinked champagne <italic>Cliquot</italic>, <italic>Mo\u00ebt</italic>, and <italic>Chandon</italic> families. In the 1890s, Tehllusson kinterlinked with the Egertons, cousins of the aristocrat Churchill-Spencers.\nGenerally, France\u2019s industrial expansion was driven by wealthy bourgeois and aristocratic landowners. Provincial bourgeoisie created most industrial empires, relying on local Catholic banks, essential for industrialization in cities like Grenoble, Nancy, Tours, Reims, Maubeuge, Ch\u00e2teau-Thierry, and Bar-le-Duc. Much smaller than <italic>Wendel</italic>, <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> was the exception to minimal Jewish involvement. \nSince Aron, Worms, and Halphen Goudchaux cousins Gaspard Dreyfus married Estelle Dupont in 1810, Estelle\u2019s brother Auguste Dupont, co-founded <italic>Dupont Dreyfus </italic>with his son-in-law Adolphe Dreyfus, advancing from timber and coal trading to establishing steel and iron operations in Lorraine during the mid-19th century. As the family kinterlinked with Oppenheim cousins Kaulla and Ratisbonnes, their clan extended to included Joseph Foa Sciama, who contributed to Egyptian public works and the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> project. \nIn 1864, Auguste Dupont\u2019s cousin Paul Dupont married a Cerf\u2014descended from Lion Halphen Goudchaux and Aisik Orchel\u2014and her sister wed Mo\u00efse Dreyfus of unknown relation in 1867, who manufactured copper and iron boilers for refining sugar and alcohol in Paris. (Another Cerf sister\u2019s son later married Adolphe Dreyfus\u2019 grandson.) By 1869, <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> employed nearly 2,000 workers. Concerns over political changes following the annexation of Lorraine led the family to move to French Pompey in 1871. \nOf unknown relation to the Dreyfus family, Isaac Dreyfu\u00df of Alsace received a residence permit in Swiss Basel in 1812, where he founded trading house<italic> Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel. A year after his son joined the business in 1839, his daughter married a Lazard cousin Picard. Isaac died in 1845, and the business became a limited partnership, with Isaac\u2019s widow fought a legal battle to retain her place in the company and became a limited partner. Along with banking, the family started a silk ribbon factory in 1853. \nAround the same time, Isaac\u2019s extended cousin Leo Dreyfu\u00df of Alsace, began transporting grain to Basel in 1850, and established his grain trading business in Basel in 1852, later adopting the hyphenated surname <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df </italic>and moving to Zurich. <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic> closely competed with <italic>Continental Grain</italic>, formed by the Fribourg family, descended from Dupont cousins from Metz who moved to Arlon, Belgium, in 1813 and imported grain during the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>. By 1876, the Fribourgs kinterlinked with French Wertheims.\nSince Swiss-Russian grain trader Leo Dreyfu\u00df married Emilie Aron Lang in 1860\u2014a third cousin once removed of Esther Cerf Aron Lazard\u2014his extended cousin<italic> </italic><italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel founder\u2019s son, Jacques, established <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt in 1868. Jacques\u2019 son, Isaac, joined in 1870 after completing his apprenticeship at <italic>Warburg</italic> in Hamburg. Jacques\u2019s experience in Basel gave the firm strong Swiss banking connections, distinguishing it from local banks. The company focused on brokerage, arbitration, and securities trading, stabilizing the currency after the 1870 French war reparations. Isaac became a partner in 1872. By 1877, Jacques\u2019s nephew, Lazard cousin Lucien Picard, was appointed procurator. \nThe Dreyfu\u00df family also kinterlinked with the Brettauers. In 1725, Jonathan Uffenheimer immigrated from Innsbruck, Austria, to Hohenems on the Swiss border. He became Court Jew to the Counts of Hohenems and later as community leader. While one son married Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s descendant, another son, Maier, succeeded him as leader. Later, Maier\u2019s daughters married a descendant of Samson Wertheim and Herz Brettauer, a Hohenems jeweler and money exchanger. \nFrom 1837, the Brettauers traded leather, later shifting to banking. Herz\u2019s great-grandson, Ludwig, married a Dreyfu\u00df and founded a Saint-Gallen bank in 1875, and Ludwig\u2019s cousin Carl, a <italic>Basler </italic><italic>Bank</italic> director, joined <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel as a partner in 1883. By then his Dreyfu\u00df wife died, and Ludwig married a niece of Jan Bloch\u2014and a Katz descendant cousin of the Hamburger and Goldschmidt families. Ludwig also formed <italic>Brettauer Knauer</italic> in Zurich in 1888, which later merged with <italic>Zurich Bank Association</italic>, and had interests in <italic>Saint-Gallen Handelsbank</italic>.\nAnd following the <italic>Franco-Prussian War</italic>, when France ceded Alsace to Germany per the <italic>Treaty of Frankfurt</italic> of 1871, <italic>Louis-</italic><italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> set up headquarters in Paris. Maintaining strong connections to Swiss banks, Leo Dreyfu\u00df registered <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic> in Odessa and Nikolaev by 1873, and expanded exports through agents like <italic>Schwabacher</italic>, <italic>Kopishtein</italic>, <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, and <italic>Levi</italic>. Soon after, his extended cousin, Julies of <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel, married a Gunzburg-in-law Brodsky. \nIn 1884, thirty foreign-born Jews, including <italic>Gildesheimer</italic>, held First Guild status in Odessa. A descendant of Aaron Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen and son of a prominent Berlin rabbi, Lev Gildesheimer was a cousin of the Katz descendant Bondi and Teomin Frankel Munk families. Around 1875, he married Jules Dreyfu\u00df\u2019s Brodsky niece-in-law. As<italic> </italic>Leo Dreyfu\u00df\u2019 brother married a Gutmann\u2014Viennese banker and co-owner with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna of <italic>Witkowitz </italic>iron and coal works of Galicia\u2014in 1886, her brother married a Gunzburg in 1886.\nIn Alsace\u2019s Protestant industrial textile center of Mulhouse in the early 1860s, the small Jewish cousin firms of Raphael Dreyfu\u00df\u2014father of the future Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dryfu\u00df \u2014and <italic>Herzog </italic><italic>Dreyfu\u00df </italic><italic>Lantz </italic>started with Mulhouse\u2019s largest Jewish textile manufactures, Elie Lantz. Along with co-founding <italic>Banque de Mulhouse</italic> in 1867, Elie\u2019s son Lazare chaired <italic>Mulhouse Savings Bank</italic>. \nAfter Germany annexed Alsace following the <italic>Franco-Prussian War</italic> <italic>of 1870</italic>, <italic>Comptoir de Mulhouse</italic>, based in German Alsace but financed by French capital, faced political challenges. During the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, the provisional government chartered <italic>Comptoir</italic> Mulhouse, becoming independent as <italic>Comptoir de Mulhouse</italic> in 1854. After the <italic>Treaty of Frankfurt</italic> of 1871 annexed part of Lorraine to Germany, Lazare negotiated Alsace-Lorraine customs with Germany, earning the Legion of Honor, and later leading <italic>Banque de Mulhouse</italic>.\nThat year, Alphonse Fould and Mayer Dupont sold the Ars factories to maintain French citizenship and relocated to Nancy in 1873. They initially worked the Montet concession before shifting to the Ludm concession, which supplied the Pompey blast furnaces, constructed in 1874. While marrying Auguste Dupont\u2019s granddaughter Fortun\u00e9e, Fould pushed Lorraine into metallurgy and took an increasing role in his father-in-law\u2019s <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic>, becoming <italic>Dupont Fould</italic>. \nHer Dreyfus cousin wed a son of an eighth-generation rabbi and boiler maker, the philosopher \u00c9mile Durkheim. By 1882, Fortun\u00e9e\u2019s brother Gustave Dupont wed Ida Halphen, a Katz cousin descended from Samuel Oppenheim, Samson Wertheim, Lion Halphen Goudchaux, and Michael Speyer. As the rolling mills produced iron beams for the <italic>Eiffel</italic> <italic>Tower</italic> in 1884, the elder Dupont died and Fould bought out the family to become the sole manager. \n<italic>Dupont Fould</italic> also cemented relationships like other Rhineland bankers and industrialists. Alphonse Fould\u2019s uncle married <italic>Cahn</italic>\u2019s cousin-in-law in 1870. By 1879, Fould\u2019s fourth cousin wed <italic>Levy</italic>-in-law and industrialist Alex Coppel\u2019s great niece. And in 1883, Fould\u2019s niece Louise married Emile Stern Halphen, affiliated with Paris\u2019 sugar refining, whose cousin once removed was Katz-Speyer descendant and Lieben cousin-in-law James Nathan \u201cHardy.\u201d \nMarrying Helen Cahn, James started London bank<italic> Hardy</italic>. Helen\u2019s brother Carl studied law and apprenticed in Frankfurt, Paris, and New York with <italic>Wertheim</italic> and <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic>. Returning to Bonn in 1884, Carl joined <italic>Cahn</italic>. Like related to Hardy, Henry Nathan joined <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> in Berlin after training at <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Hamburg the same year. Since Carl\u2019s great uncle and <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne\u2019s Salomon Oppenheim married the Katz-descendant Chief Rabbi of Bonn\u2019s daughters, their second great-nephew married Alex Coppel\u2019s second great niece in 1887.\nLikewise, Frankfurt-born Felix Schuster\u2014a great-nephew of converted Manchester cotton merchant and London banker Leo Schuster and a descendant of from Michael Speyer, the Halle Court Jews, and cousins of the Goldschmidt and Jeidel families\u2014have moved from Frankfurt to London, where he became a British citizen. In 1888, <italic>Schuster</italic> was taken over by <italic>Union Bank of London</italic>, and he became director, and later Governor.\nIn Paris, Isidore Dreyfus led the development of<italic> Cr\u00e9dit G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Fran\u00e7ais</italic> (\u201cCGF\u201d) in 1872, with capital contributions from <italic>Beleys</italic>, <italic>Porto-Riche</italic>, <italic>Paniagua</italic>, and <italic>Blanchard</italic>. CGF bought <italic>Moniteur des Tirages Financiers</italic> newspaper and issued Haitian bonds. In 1874, CGF joined <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> and several other French banks to loan 83.5 million <italic>francs</italic> to Haiti. Since her independence, Haiti faced a 150 million <italic>franc</italic> slave debt to France, reduced to 90 by 1838 until civil war precluded the final payment in 1867. Failing to establish a national bank with American citizen Lazarus, Haiti defaulted on the 1874 by 1876. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Moniteur </italic>grew and CGF issued <italic>Tramways du Nord</italic> shares in 1876. In 1879, Blanchard and Paniagua resigned from the board, leading to <italic>Erlanger</italic> and <italic>Berthier</italic> taking control. By 1880, <italic>Banque Nationale d\u2019Haiti</italic> was successfully founded in 1880 with funds from <italic>Erlanger</italic>. In 1885, Haiti restructured the 1875 bonds, converting them from 8 to 5% interest and extending the repayment period. While <italic>Erlanger</italic> increased capital,<italic> </italic>CGF failed soon after Isidore\u2019s grandson Gaston married a of Kulp and K\u00f6nigswarter descendant in 1883. Gaston founded <italic>Anglo-French Lloyd</italic> in 1903.\nGiven the freedoms that Jews long held in Worms, Michael Gernsheim founded a leather business <italic>Gernsheim</italic> in 1768 and was elected the Jewish Bishop of Worms for over three decades. While Napoleon revoked this office, Michael\u2019s cousin married an Oppenheim of unknown lineage, and their great-grandson was the Mayor of Worms Ferdinand Gernsheim Eberstadt, who helped Salomon Loeb immigrate to America, where he co-founded <italic>Kuhn Netter</italic>. Of unknown relation to this family, Loeb\u2019s cousin Sol wed Regine Gernsheim of Worms, a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim. \nAfter working as a sales representative for <italic>Gernsheim</italic>, Isaac Adler\u2014married to Rosa Goldschmidt of Worms\u2014partnered with Ferdinand Oppenheim to establish a tannery in Strasbourg by 1872 and Ferdinand married Rosa\u2019s sister. <italic>Adler Oppenheim</italic> expanded into one of Europe\u2019s greatest leathery businesses. Their children married German Jews in the leather trade and an engineering company. As other Jews left Alsatian for Paris, some broke tradition and entered modern industries away from the family. Court Jew descendant Ernest Wertheim left his family\u2019s necktie business and partnered with <italic>Bourjois</italic>, a producer of fragrances, theatrical makeup, and top-selling rice face powder, <italic>Java</italic>.\nMeanwhile, converted brothers Armand Heine and Michel Heine took over French Jewish mining finance. After establishing a commission and banking business in New Orleans in 1842, Armand married the daughter of New Orleans banker Joachim Kohn in 1860, whose son had started a bank in Paris in 1847. By 1866, the Heine brothers returned to Paris and joined their cousins at<italic> Fould Oppenheim</italic> in 1865, their Hamburg cousin Paule Heine wed the Duke of Elchingen in 1866. Kohn\u2019s nephew, meanwhile, married <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels\u2019 banker Joseph Oppenheim\u2019s niece Eugenie Oppenheim Emden, and her sister wed Jacques Reinach, her second cousin once removed through the Schnapper family. Soon after, <italic>Reinach</italic> bank of Paris became <italic>Kohn Reinach</italic> under Senior Partner Jacques Reinach.\nFollowing Adolphe Fould\u2019s death in 1875, The Foulds turned over <italic>Fould Oppenheim</italic> to <italic>Heine</italic> Paris, and Michel\u2019s daughter married the Duke of Richelieu. Taking over <italic>Fould</italic>\u2019s banking operations and expanded their influence, with Michel becoming a Regent of BDF in 1890. As both Heine brothers died by 1904, their former head of <italic>Heine</italic> New Orleans, Alfred Bechmann, then took over as Managing Partner of <italic>Heine</italic> Paris and added his relatives to the firm. By 1908, <italic>Comptoir</italic> named him Director several months after his aristocratic cousin-in-law married a Thellusson descendant.\nSince constructing <italic>Suez Canal</italic>, Ferdinand Lesseps initiated <italic>Panama Canal</italic> in the late 1870s with <italic>Kohn</italic> <italic>Reinach</italic> financing. Despite challenges, including opposition from the America due to concerns over the <italic>Monroe Doctrine</italic>, he negotiated exclusive rights to construct the canal through Panama from the Colombian government. Lesseps garnered support from William Seligman of Paris and formed syndicates by country to create the impression of widespread American involvement. While only <italic>Seligman</italic> London sold subscriptions in Britain,<italic> Seligman</italic> New York, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and <italic>Winslow Lanier</italic> did so in America, and <italic>Seligman</italic> Paris, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Caisse d\u2019Escompte</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, and others were agents in France. \nAs <italic>Morgan</italic> funded on <italic>Panama</italic> RR, the railroad sold her canal interest to French <italic>Lesseps</italic> to form <italic>Panama Canal Co</italic> in 1880, whose American committee was mainly <italic>Seligman</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Egisto Fabbri, a partner of shipper <italic>Fabbri Chauncey </italic>with Chilean-born Frederick Chauncey. The same year, <italic>Kohn</italic> <italic>Reinach</italic>\u2014represented by <italic>Morton</italic> <italic>Rose</italic>\u2019s Pascoe Grenfell\u2014joined <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic>, <italic>Kendy</italic>, and James Hill of <italic>Great Northern</italic> RR to establish <italic>Canadian Pacific</italic> RR as an alternative to the Orient.\n<italic>Lesseps</italic>\u2019 construction of the <italic>Panama Canal</italic> faced numerous challenges, including landslides, yellow fever outbreaks, and engineering complexities due to the region\u2019s geography. By the late 1880s, only about a third of the canal was completed. As <italic>Morgan</italic> resigned from her committee in 1888, <italic>Lesseps</italic> filed for bankruptcy within months. This failure led to a scandal involving bribery of French parliamentarians to conceal the project\u2019s financial troubles. Ferdinand Lesseps and his son Charles were convicted of corruption and sentenced to prison, though Ferdinand\u2019s failing health spared him incarceration. \nAttacking the Reinachs, the scandal also exacerbated antisemitism rhetoric about Jewish influence in French society. Despite this setback, John Morgan\u2019s interest in canal projects persisted, and he, along with his father, turned their attention to a potential Nicaraguan route. However, this project did not materialize, and <italic>Morgan</italic> did not directly reengage in canal-related endeavors until the Theodore Roosevelt Administration secured the <italic>Panama Canal</italic> site.\nFollowing the collapse of <italic>Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>and Russian pogroms of 1882, elite Jewish banks flourished in France. Among 440 bankers in 1892, 90 to 100 were Jewish, including 5 <italic>Dreyfus</italic>, 3 <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, 3 <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, 2 <italic>Ephrussi</italic>, and others like <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Kohn</italic> <italic>Reinach</italic>, <italic>Propper</italic>, <italic>Cah\u00e9n</italic>, <italic>Heine</italic>, <italic>Camondo</italic>, <italic>K\u00f6nigswarter</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>Gunzburg</italic>, <italic>Halphen</italic>, <italic>Seligmann</italic>, and <italic>d\u2019W</italic><italic>orms</italic>. Some families of the same name\u2014such as <italic>Oppenheim</italic>\u2014were not closely related. \nWhile few were connected to many, some connections were very close. Jacob Silny\u2019s descendants include brothers Gar\u00e7on and Lazarus. Gar\u00e7on\u2019s daughter Marie married Abraham Lazard\u2019s grandson Elie Lazard Jr in 1867. Elie Lazard Jr\u2019s sister, Lisa, wed Th\u00e9odore Weill, and their son Elie married Lazarus Silny\u2019s granddaughter. While a Halphen married a Speyer cousin of Bischoffsheim\u2019s in-law Germain Cassel of Brussels in 1887, Count Joseph Cah\u00e9n\u2019s children with Clara Bischoffsheim paired with Morpurgo, Warshavsky, Rothschild, Camondo, and Reinach heirs by the 1890s.\nIn America, <italic>Lee</italic>-affiliated <italic>Calumet </italic>cartelized Michigan copper through the 1870s. However, immigrant Jews soon mined the West. Since Fromet Guggenheim married Moses Mendelssohn, her kin and their descendants banked and held religious jurisdiction in Copenhagen, Metz, Tyrol, and Switzerland. Immigrating from Switzerland to American in 1848, Meyer Guggenheim peddled and established various businesses before his <italic>Guggenheim</italic> funded in Colorado lead mines. And after his Goldschmidt cousin-in-law married a Kaulla and sister married a Katz-descendant, Adolph Lewisohn immigrated from Hamburg in 1867, and started <italic>Lewisohn</italic> to ship copper from Montana eastward by 1879. \nSimultaneously, <italic>OIL</italic>, <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> cousins, and Meyer Guggenheim\u2019s son Isaac competed in Canadian oil. After the Canadian Confederation in 1867, the federal government imposed tariffs on refined oil imports to protect the domestic industry from American competition. Among the key entrepreneurs were Jacob Englehart, a Cleveland-born Bavarian Jew, and Solomon Sonneborn, who traded whisky and were avoiding American taxes in Canada. Building a refinery in Petrolia, Ontario, Englehart sought to monopolize Canadian refining. \nWhile the first scheme failed, cartel efforts followed, such as <italic>Lambton</italic> <italic>Crude Oil Partnership</italic> in 1871, stabilizing prices. However, John Fairbank\u2014an extended cousin of the <italic>Clark</italic>, <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>, and Boston Brahmin families\u2014backed James Williams to create a new refining company outside cartel control. Canada\u2019s oil industry in Petrolia saw production increase from 190,000 barrels in 1868 to 365,000 barrels by 1873.\nHowever, the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> and the discovery of larger oil fields in Pennsylvania led to a decline in Canadian production, which fell to 165,000 barrels in 1874, squeezing <italic>Carbon Oil</italic>, whose co-founder Solomon Sonneborn\u2019s uncle Jonas faced financial troubles and creditors pursuing him for fraud. So, Jacob Englehart distanced himself from Sonneborn and partnered with Isaac Guggenheim, who married Jonas\u2019 niece. \nEnglehart acquired <italic>Carbon Oil</italic> works and transformed it into <italic>Silver Star Refinery</italic> with investment from Guggenheim. In 1880, Englehart started <italic>Imperial Oil</italic> to control 85% of Canadian refining. Despite attempts to stabilize kerosene prices, new competitors like <italic>Mutual Oil Co</italic>, entered the market. As competition from <italic>OIL</italic> pressured the Canadian market, <italic>Imperial Oil</italic> maintained dominance in Canada but struggled to compete.\nBut the Sonneborn family continued to thrive in textiles and oil refining. Since Henry Sonneborn immigrated to Baltimore, Maryland, he founded a men\u2019s clothing factory in the early 1870s that later became among the largest in the country. Leaving their village in Germany, Sonneborn cousins joined Josef and Leo Stern in the early 1880s to establish <italic>Rheinische Vaseline</italic> in Cologne. Jacques Sonneborn, Henry\u2019s son, joined this firm in 1886 after apprenticing at a Frankfurt bank, and became a partner in 1889 before the firm incorporated as <italic>Oelwerke</italic> <italic>Stern-Sonneborn</italic>, with branches in Hamburg, London, Paris, and Genoa.\nSince <italic>Lee</italic>-extended cousins <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> refocused from importing metals to mining, they kinterlinked with <italic>Continental Bank & Trust</italic> financier Hartley in 1880, and acquired several Arizona copper mines. When ruinous competition led Americans to sell excess copper to Europe by 1883, <italic>Phelps</italic> <italic>Dodge </italic>kinterlinked <italic>New York</italic> LIC <italic>& Trust</italic>. Since the first <italic>International Rail Manufacturers\u2019 Association</italic> formed during the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, international cartels spread, with Germany participating in 40 by 1897. Since the start of the Anglo-Indian shipping cartel in 1875, these conferences extended to include north European exporters by 1885. Similar conferences started in Australia and South Africa within a year, and in the Americas over the next decade.\nFrom 1885, <italic>Comptoir</italic> funded Hyacinth Secretan\u2019s <italic>M\u00e9taux</italic> in cartelizing global copper. After <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, <italic>Lyonnais, Paribas</italic>, and other French banks joined the cartel, they added <italic>Cohen-Barent</italic>, <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic>, and <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>. Since co-funding <italic>Dutch South African </italic>RR with <italic>Warschauer</italic> in 1887, <italic>Berliner </italic>soon became German southwest Africa\u2019s main export-trade bank, particularly for diamonds. \nAs <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC transformed into a joint stock in 1889, had investors and directors included <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Smyth</italic>, <italic>Jardine</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic>, <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>London, <italic>Wagg</italic>, <italic>Newgass</italic>, <italic>Beeton</italic>, <italic>International Bank of Hamburg & London</italic> Carl Meyer, the Duke of Fife\u2019s partner and Bevan cousin-in-law Horace Farquhar, diamond merchant <italic>Mosenthal</italic>, and Welsh smelter Dillwyn Parrish were major shareholders. While Carl Meyer of Prussia\u2014<italic>Rothschild </italic>London\u2019s agent at <italic>DeBeers</italic>, HSBC, and other ventures,<italic> International Bank </italic>affiliated with <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Schiff.\nAfter <italic>Lewisohn</italic> joined with <italic>Lee</italic>-affiliated <italic>Calumet</italic> in Michigan in America in 1887, their London cousin married Rebecca Solomon. A granddaughter of the Katz-descendent Chief Rabbi of Britain Nathan Adler, Solomon\u2019s sister was a daughter-in-law of Lewis Lazarus, who had co-founded <italic>London Metal Exchange</italic> in 1882. But as stable prices increased supply, Secretan\u2019s <italic>M\u00e9taux</italic> copper cartel crashed in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic> after demand fell. As <italic>Comptoir</italic> President Eug\u00e8ne Denfert-Rochereau committed suicide and started a run. Likewise, <italic>Kohn Reinach</italic> Senior Partner Baron Jacques Reinach committed suicide.\n\u00c9douard Hentsch resigned as Chair of <italic>Comptoir </italic>and <italic>Indochine</italic>, and BDF reorganized <italic>Comptoir </italic>into a deposit bank. While Alexis Rostand became General Manager of <italic>Comptoir</italic>, Frankfurt-born Emile Oulman became the bank\u2019s Secretary General. And as <italic>Lyonnais</italic> suffered more losses, she likewise refocused on deposits. (Before Germain died in 1905, he saw <italic>Lyonnais</italic> become the largest bank in France. After seventeen years, Germain\u2019s son-in-law became Chair of <italic>Lyonnais</italic>.) In 1891, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and Cassel refused to invest in American copper. \nAlthough mixed alliances between Jewish elites and Christian aristocracy and bourgeoisie families multiplied in Paris and London since the 1860s, the trend reversed between 1880 and 1900, likely due to antisemitism as Eastern European Jews fled pogroms to the West. French antisemitism fermented by the <italic>Panama Canal Co </italic>scandal reached a fever pitch in 1894, when French authorities arrested Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df, the only Jewish officer on the French army staff, on charges of passing military secrets to the German embassy. \nDespite a lack of evidence, Dreyfu\u00df was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment.  Dreyfu\u00df\u2019 Lazard cousins, their Fould, Rothschild, Halphen in-laws, and other co-religionists and defenders of freedom defended Dreyfu\u00df to uncover the truth. Through twelve years of wrongful imprisonment, Dreyfu\u00df supporters were fashionably ostracized by Christian French society. After Dreyfu\u00df was exonerated 1906, his niece Marguerite married Adolphe Reinach, niece married a grandson of deceased <italic>Kohn Reinach</italic> Senior Partner Baron Jacques Reinach in 1912.\nJews continued to link international merchant banking. While <italic>TURK</italic> had established a branch in the Jewish metropolis of Turkish Salonica on the border with Greece in 1863, <italic>Comptoir</italic> formed<italic> Bank of Salonica</italic> a year before collapsing in 1889 with the greatest textile merchants, Allatini and Modiano. As <italic>TURK</italic> took over the bank, Frankfurt-born Emile Oulman of <italic>Comptoir</italic> became a Director of <italic>Bank of Salonica</italic>. \nSince engaging in wheat trade, shipping, insurance, flour, bricking, and tobacco from the 1830s, Allatini kinterlinked with <italic>Morpurgo</italic>, <italic>Camondo</italic>, <italic>Manheimer </italic>of Calmar, and the <italic>Transatlantique</italic> affiliated <italic>Lumbroso</italic> of Tunesia, and acquired mining concessions around Greece, including one for antimony and R\u00fc\u015fden arsenic in 1882, Kozani chromium mine in the 1890s, and a stake in <italic>Kassandra Mines</italic>. By 1898, they incorporated their interests in <italic>Ottoman Industrial & Commercial Co of Salonica</italic>.\nLe Havre\u2019s sole Jews for a long time, widow Suzanne Gomperz Homberg grew <italic>Homberg</italic> trader internationally. While she died in 1775 without receiving naturalization, the family began slave trading and converted to Catholicism by 1785 to inherit their fortunes before kinterlinking with French families and becoming a large BDF shareholder from 1806. \nWhen <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s Tonkin coal concession came up for renewal in 1887, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> wanted to eliminate <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2019s monopoly and establish a rival in Tonkin. By 1891, Octave Homberg became General Director of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and Censor of BDF. Although Homberg and Edward Blount lobbied for an open market for concessions, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> lost to <italic>Indochine</italic> as <italic>Comptoir</italic> courted the Republican majority. Eventually, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> became a part owner of <italic>Indochine</italic>, with <italic>Lyonnais</italic> joining in 1896.\nSince the failure of Andre Langrand\u2019s <italic>Foncier</italic> scheme in the 1860s, French agriculture continued to suffer from low credit. In 1894, the Chamber of Deputies proposed a law to establish rural credit for small farmers, formalizing society formation rules, tax exemptions, and a monopoly on state-subsidized farm loans. In 1897, BDF allocated funds through the agriculture minister for these credit societies. Finally, in 1899, a law was enacted to create regional banks that acted as intermediaries between local societies and the agriculture minister. This framework established <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</italic>\u2019s hierarchy. \nWhile <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and Cassel refused to invest in American copper in 1891, this changed as  Italy, America via TA1890, and France extending tariffs in 1887, 1890, and 1892 following Germany\u2019s lead in 1879. In 1895, <italic>Rothschild</italic><italic> </italic>Paris, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, Cassel, and others invested in Rockefeller\u2019s copper interests to cartelize global production into <italic>COPPER</italic><italic> </italic>with <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> as counsel and <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt</italic> and <italic>Lewisohn</italic><italic> </italic>as buying partners.\nSince <italic>Lewisohn</italic>\u2014a long-time cousin-in-law of the Goldschmidts\u2014kinterlinked with<italic> London Metal Exchange</italic> co-founder <italic>Lazarus</italic> via Chief Rabbi of Britain Nathan Adler\u2019s grandchildren, their sibling married a Rothschild cousin descendant of Levi Cohen-Barent in 1897, kinterlinking with <italic>Metallgesellschaft </italic>and <italic>Ladenburg</italic> <italic>Thalmann</italic>. Likewise, Goldschmidt-grandson and Oppenheim-in-law Paul Speyer, Head of the London metal trading house <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt</italic>\u2014which dominated Britain\u2019s copper trade\u2014married Olga Warburg (a sister-in-law of Swedish Magnez) in 1898, cementing metal trade for <italic>Warburg </italic>and <italic>Kuhn</italic>. \nIn 1899, <italic>COPPER</italic> issued shares through Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Citi</italic>, with <italic>Lewisohn </italic>organizing a syndicate for distributing the stock in Europe including <italic>Ladenburg</italic> <italic>Thalmann</italic>\u2019s long-term partner<italic> Schr\u00f6der</italic>. However, Seligman-in-laws <italic>Guggenheim</italic> refused to sell out to <italic>OIL</italic>, <italic>Lewisohn</italic>, and <italic>Schley</italic> in <italic>SMELTER</italic> in 1899. Under pressure to reach an agreement, <italic>Guggenheim</italic> gained control of <italic>SMELTER</italic>. \nIn Canada, Guggenheim-funded<italic> Imperial Oil</italic> faced financial and competitive challenges that jeopardized its future. Shareholders pressured the company for dividends after years of stagnation, prompting <italic>Imperial</italic> to secure a short-term loan from <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> in 1891. This financial strain intensified after the acquisition of <italic>Premier Oil Co</italic> in 1894. Net profits stabilized, but the burden of dividends and loan interest reduced liquidity and hindered exploration of new oil fields. Simultaneously, <italic>OIL</italic> solidified her dominance in Canada with long-term contracts in the Maritimes and Quebec.\nMoreover, <italic>OIL</italic> reorganized her operations by creating in 1888 to consolidate marketing efforts in Britain and Canada. Samuel Rogers, a key distributor for <italic>OIL</italic> since 1880, formed <italic>Queen City Oil</italic> with John Fairbank in 1896. Struggling to compete, <italic>Imperial</italic> attempted to negotiate with the British <italic>Colonial Development Corp</italic> for a takeover, but discussions stalled. By 1898, negotiations with <italic>Colonial</italic> ended, leading Fitzgerald to initiate talks with <italic>OIL</italic>. This resulted in <italic>OIL</italic> acquiring 75% of <italic>Imperial</italic>, folding her Canadian operations into <italic>Imperial</italic>, and providing a dividend to shareholders. \nHowever, cartelization and modernization stirred laborer unrest as over 2,500 unskilled laborers became redundant. While <italic>Rothschild</italic>-affiliated <italic>Vienna</italic> <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> bought<italic> </italic>up Galician Boryslaw oil land from <italic>Co Commerciale Francaise</italic> and Gartenberg in 1895, Gartenberg partnered with Hirsch-affiliated <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> with the Offenheim and Biedermann families of Vienna, and Canadian <italic>Bergheim MacGarvey </italic>contracted with <italic>Galician </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic><italic> Bank</italic>. \nLikewise, a Kolischer\u2014related to<italic> </italic>the Gartenbergs and <italic>Galician Mortgage </italic>Bank\u2019s deceased founder\u2014kintrelinked with a <italic>Roth</italic><italic>s</italic><italic>child</italic>-affiliated Mises family. However, as the unemployed Jewish community appealed to Hirsch\u2019s colonization venture for immigration support, Gartenberg married a fellow local Jewish oil magnate and established a bank. Struggling to compete, only two local firms remained by 1899.\nGeo-politics shifted since Russian opposition led Persia to grant concessions to <italic>Sassoon</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Reuter</italic>, and Sir Drummond Wolff since 1872. After Wolff traveled on diplomatic missions to Egypt from 1876, he focused on Egyptian affairs as British Commissioner in Constantinople in 1885. By 1887, he was Britain\u2019s Teheran Envoy. Against local and British opposition, Russia extended <italic>Trans-Caspian</italic> RR across the Silk Road caravan route from Orenburg to Tashkent. \nGiven Russian persecution, many Jews fled to Central Asia. As Bukharan Jews had escaped the <italic>Pale of Settlement </italic>and pogroms, they settled in Moscow and used bank credit to trade across the Empire. By 1885, Yehuda Smorguner acquired coal mining rights in Zeravshan. Likewise, many Ashkenazi moved to Bukhara, but there was little intermarriage. While Amin Hajj did not establish a Franco-German-style investment bank in 1887 as planned, he ventured into pioneering projects, including a silk-spinning factory in Ra\u0161t, a railway connecting Amol to iron mines, and a glass and porcelain factory in Tehran.\nAs <italic>Trans-Caspian</italic> RR linked Moscow to Bukhara, anti-Jewish outbreaks in Persia in 1888 prompted intervention by a Rothschild, Goldsmid, and Sebag Montefiore. That year, Russia and British agreed to respect an independent Persia, the British <italic>Oriental Bank</italic> established seven branches across Persia. Within a year, Lazar Polyakov expanded into Central Asia and constructed a match factory in Tehran. With his Rafalovich-in-law the following year, Polyakov secured a railroad and custom bank monopoly,<italic> </italic><italic>Russo-Persian</italic><italic> Bank</italic>. After Lazar\u2019s daughter married Reuben Gubbay, son of the head of <italic>Sassoon</italic> Shanghai in 1891, Britain\u2019s <italic>Sassoon</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Glyn </italic>transformed <italic>Oriental Bank</italic><italic> </italic>into <italic>Imperial Bank of Persia</italic>. \nIn India, meanwhile, as shippers earned more from freight than passengers, Jamsetji Tata initiated his own steamship line in 1890, with agreements with <italic>Lloyd</italic> and others to united Parsee trade and compete with <italic>Jardine</italic>, <italic>Sassoon</italic>, Gujarati, and other players. As his competitors lowered rates and his Parsee funders withdrew support, <italic>Tata</italic> discontinued the line while continuing to own Chinese opium shippers. But as China grew and taxed her own opium, she taxed Indian imports. By 1891, Britain\u2019s Parliament banned the opium trade. While <italic>Russell</italic>, HSBC\u2019s comprador, and <italic>Oriental Bank </italic>failed in early 1892, <italic>Sassoon</italic> and other bankers convinced Parliament to delay implementation of the ban and divided Chinese trade territories with <italic>Jardine</italic> through HSBC.\nWith her opium exports constricted, India imposed tariffs and excise taxes on imports to compensate for the revenue loss, which resulted in the closure of several Indian cotton mills. With successive natural disasters the unsteady rupee caused the closure of mints to the free coinage of silver in 1893. Since <italic>Oudh Commercial Bank</italic> and other Indian-only promoted banks were local concerns, Westernized aristocrats founded <italic>Punjab National Bank</italic> in 1894 as the sole significant Indian-promoted institution as European-style banks multiplied.\nFollowing the death of his only son from tuberculosis in 1887, Maurice Hirsch mostly focused on Jewish charity, while Cassel ran the business. Since building a quarter of Russia\u2019s railroads, Samuel Polyakov Westernized Russia\u2019s economy before dying in 1888. Amidst criticism of slow construction, cost inflation, corrupt allocation of shares, and poor materials, railroads accidents grew. \nStill, there were relatively few passenger railroad fatalities. However, as the Imperial family miraculously escaped unharmed aboard the 1888 <italic>Borki</italic> train disaster, blamed on Polyakov, deepened anti-Jewish sentiment. While Polyakov avoided the fallout from <italic>Borki</italic>, his brother-in-law Abram Warshavsky committed suicide that year. Yakov Polyakov\u2019s daughter Anna married Warshavsky\u2019s Portugalov cousins, the Rubinsteins of Kharkov, soon after.\nSince the 1880s, Hungarian banks expanded beyond the capital. <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, for instance, branched to provincial cities or, when unprofitable, partnered with local. By 1900, <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> controlled six provincial banks from Moravia to Transylvania. <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic> controlled multiple banks, including <italic>Hungarian </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic> and <italic>Croatian Creditbank</italic>. Smaller banks like <italic>First Pest Savings Bank</italic> invested in institutions such as <italic>Kolozsvar Savings Bank</italic> in Cluj, Transylvania. By then, <italic>Creditbank</italic>, <italic>Commercial Bank</italic>, <italic>Mortgage & Discount Bank</italic>, and <italic>First</italic> <italic>Pest Savings Bank</italic> together controlled 47% of Hungary\u2019s capital. \nWhile domestic banks controlled 17% of Hungarian industry in 1900, the figure rose to 47% by 1913 as <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> gained controlling stakes in <italic>Rimammurany Iron Works</italic>, <italic>Salgotarjan Coal Mines</italic>, and <italic>Adria Shipping</italic>. Among the earliest bankers to funnel savings into investment was <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>\u2019s Zsigmond Kornfeld. In 1880s, he organized <italic>Fiume First Hungarian Rice Mill & Starch </italic>in 1882, founded <italic>Transylvanian Petroleum Share</italic>, and <italic>Hungarian Metal & Lamp Manufacturing Share.</italic> \nWithin a decade, he gained control of <italic>Hungarian River </italic><italic>British India </italic>and <italic>Danubius Shipyard</italic>, built interests in <italic>Budapest-P\u00e9cs</italic> RR, and served as President of <italic>Electric & Transportation Share</italic>. After he became President of <italic>Budapest Commodity & Stock Exchange </italic>in 1899, the Emperor Franz Joseph appointed him to the Upper House in 1901.\nDespite the rail cartel following the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, other Austrian industries remained fragmented. In 1888, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s<italic> Creditanstalt</italic> took control of the Pecek sugar refinery, which she restructured into a joint-stock company. <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> also provided credit to the Jewish Mayou and Christian aristocrats, such as Count Lichtenstein, Prince Schwarzenberg, and Prince Salm. Likewise, the Christian Czech mortgage <italic>Zivnostenska Bank </italic>invested in medium-sized factories in Bohemia and Moravia.\nBy 1889, <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s Carl F\u00fcrstenberg married Aniela Epshteyn Natanson, whose cousins owned Poland\u2019s largest sugar refinery and kinterlinked with<italic> Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent <italic>Lambert</italic> of Brussels. That year, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna affiliated <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>, which owned several Hungarian sugar mills, joined <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Disconto </italic>to found <italic>Hungarian Sugar</italic>. \nAlong with <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, Austro-Hungarian and German bankers formed the empire\u2019s first a sugar cartel in 1891, with <italic>Creditbank</italic> gaining control of <italic>Hungarian Sugar</italic>. American <italic>SUGAR</italic> joined the cartel in 1894 and <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Prague agreed with <italic>SUGAR</italic>\u2019s New York brokers to supply Austro-Hungarian sugar to America. A subsequent attempt in 1895 to unify refineries with raw sugar producers failed without <italic>SUGAR</italic>, leading to a separate refinery cartel with quotas and monthly adjustments. \nIn 1896, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Prague branch, along with <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Rothschild </italic>London, gained control of the British-owned Nestomitz refinery, the largest in the empire, from <italic>Rothschild </italic>London and <italic>Kleinwort</italic>. By 1897, after a global market downturn, refiners and raw sugar producers unified into a single cartel. Thereafter, banks focused more on transforming existing firms into joint stock companies, withdrawing from new ventures. Likewise, the Prague banks expanded across the Austrian Empire, including to Slovenia, with <italic>Zivnostenska </italic>supporting the Mayor of Ljubljana in forming <italic>Ljubljana</italic> <italic>Credit </italic>in 1900. \nWhile Hermann Rafalovich of Paris had joined<italic> Mendelssohn</italic> and <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> on <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s board in 1885, most of his French family continued converting and marrying Catholics. After Horace Gunzburg was one of the few Jews invited to participate in Russia\u2019s commission examining Jewish laws from 1888, he was a appointed state councilor in 1889. As <italic>Gunzburg</italic>-funded and <italic>Ralli</italic>-chaired <italic>Odessa Accounting Bank </italic>of 1879 thrived, Rafalovich and Gunzburg founded<italic> Odessa Trade & Industrial Commercial Bank </italic>in 1889.  \nAs the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic> spread to Russia, Latvian sawmill owners liquidated and sugar magnate stock fortunes collapsed in Ukraine. Against complaints about banks speculating in stock, Russia empowered the <italic>Ministry of Finance </italic>to regulate their activities, prohibit operations, and demand information in 1889. While Gunzburg transformed <italic>Saint-Petersburg Exchange</italic>, his firm re-focused on gold mining by 1890. \nSimilarly, Romanian Jewish oil banker <italic>Marmorosch </italic>of Bucharest obtained investment from <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter Bank</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>. While Marmorosch\u2019s granddaughter wed a Viennese Ulmann, of a likely but unknown relation to the Ulmans, in 1884, the nephew of Marmorosch\u2019s son-in-law married a cousin-in-law of <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>\u2019s Kornfeld in 1890.\nBefore leading <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>, Siegmund Kornfeld started at <italic>Thorsch</italic> Prague. As Austrian oil competed with coal, Prague and Vienna banker Alfons Thorsch founded an oil refinery in Bohemia by 1889. His father descended from Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, and his maternal grandfather\u2019s forefathers were Behrend Lehmann and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s uncle. His maternal grandmother was the daughter of a <italic>Cahn</italic> heiress and a Katz descendant of the Chief Rabbi of Bonn, connecting him to <italic>Lippma</italic><italic>n</italic><italic>n Rosenthal</italic>. \nAs elsewhere, advances in oil and workers\u2019 demands spurred strikes. Although Austrian labor unions were legalized in 1867, the government often led the meetings. During the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, rising coal prices fueled strikes across Austria, including among employees of <italic>Reitzes</italic>\u2019 railroads. Jewish socialists like Viktor Adler and Christian leaders like Pastor Eichhorn criticized <italic>Reitzes</italic> for alleged exploitation and delaying electrification, even though his actions had incidentally preserved many coachmen\u2019s jobs. \nWith rising coal prices, Ignaz Petschek, cousin-in-law of Wertheim and in-law of <italic>Nathansohn Kallir</italic>, established his own coal agency in 1890. While <italic>Galician Bank for Trade </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Industry</italic> faced bankruptcy and was restructured with investment from <italic>Union </italic><italic>Bank of Vienna</italic>. Likewise, Galicia\u2019s <italic>Bielsko-Bia</italic><italic>l</italic><italic>a Trade </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Industrial Bank</italic> became a branch of<italic> </italic><italic>Union Bank</italic><italic> of </italic><italic>Bohemi</italic><italic>a</italic>.\nAs <italic>Marmorosch</italic> cousins<italic> </italic><italic>L\u00f6bel </italic>kinterlinked with a Bondi cousin of <italic>Union </italic><italic>Bank of Vienna</italic> in 1891. A first cousin twice removed of Bondi-in-law Rabbi of Posen and first cousin twice removed of the Laski family related to the Zbytkower, Toeplitz, and other Warsaw bankers, Otto Feilchenfeld was Chair of <italic>Poldina Hut</italic>, VP of <italic>Prague Iron Co</italic>, a board member of the boards of <italic>Lower Austrian Discount </italic><italic>Bank</italic> and <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank</italic>. Since co-founding <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank</italic><italic> </italic>in the 1860s with <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>,<italic> Lower Austrian Discount </italic>expanded her Hungarian interests and took over the Prague bank in 1901. \nLikewise, since Sigmund Popper Rosenfeld married the granddaughter of David Biedermann in 1870 in joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> and <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic><italic> </italic>by 1880, he established Vienna bank <italic>Rosenfeld</italic><italic> </italic>in 1890, securing limited partners including <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, <italic>Union Bank</italic><italic> of </italic><italic>Bohemia</italic>, and <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Berlin. Beginning at <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> in 1883, Rosenfeld\u2019s nephew Wilhelm Kux became VP of <italic>Lower Austrian Discount Bank</italic><italic> </italic>in 1904. That year, Rosenfeld\u2019s other nephew from another sister, also named Wilhelm Kux, married the daughter of Moldovan Galatz banker Jacques Rubenstein. Rubenstein\u2019s brother had married Katz-descendant Anna Byk Rottenberg, whose brother Sigmund had married a daughter of <italic>Marmorosch</italic>\u2019s Abraham L\u00f6bel.\nWhile the Bondi descended from Katz and delBanco Warburg families, they kinterlinked with Kafka, who connected them to Moritz Bondy of Prague, Siegmund Kornfeld\u2019s cousin once removed, a nephew of Warburg Oppenheim. While Moritz traded copper, hammer, and rolling mill products, his son Otto focused on metal trading near Vienna in 1889 and later transformed it into <italic>Cable Factory & Wire Industry</italic> in 1896. By 1923, the company employed around 2,000 workers, producing iron, copper, bronze, and steel wires. Moritz\u2019s other son, Max, led <italic>Union Bank</italic><italic> of </italic><italic>Bohemia</italic> and established <italic>Copper Works Bohemia Joint Stock Co</italic> near Aussig in 1899, employing about 600 workers by 1923. Max was granted Austrian nobility in 1914. \nSince Czech Christian Emil \u0160koda purchased Bohemian sugar works from Count Waldstein in 1869, financed by loans from his Vienna-based uncle and brewing industry relatives, the firm expanded into steel production in 1889 and armaments in 1890. From 1891, \u0160koda sought significant long-term credit from <italic>Creditanstalt</italic><italic> </italic>and<italic> Bohemian Discount Bank</italic>, receiving a substantial mortgage loan and subsequent credit lines. The firm incorporated in 1899 with funding from both banks. Following Emil \u0160koda\u2019s death, his son Karl faced financial challenges, leading to increased bank involvement, reshaping the company\u2019s financial and governance structure. By 1897, steel magnate Karl Wittgenstein severed ties with <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank</italic> and became a member of the board of directors of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>.\nAs famine struck by 1891, Saint-Petersburg expelled two thousand Jews to the <italic>Pale</italic>, many in chains. Moscow soon expelled ten times as many. Amidst Moscow\u2019s harsh winter, the Polyakovs saw tearful farewells and bundled belongings amidst crowds of evacuees including the elderly and crippled. With losses on South African gold ventures out of France and the collapse of <italic>Rafalovich</italic>, <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Saint-Petersburg and <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Paris suspended payment and went into receivership without government support. \nWhile Horace Gunzburg satisfied his debts as his son Alex Rosenberg Gunzburg wed Rosa Rosenberg Warburg, he ceased banking, and refocused on helping Russian Jewry. Another son, Goldschmidt-in-law Solomon, resumed <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Paris. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> resumed Russian state loans with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Bleichroder</italic>, and <italic>Disconto,</italic> the Russian state began construction of <italic>Trans-Siberian</italic> RR toward Vladivostok, with investors including <italic>Saint-Petersburg Discount Bank</italic> and <italic>Saint-Petersburg International Commercial Bank</italic>. Likewise, French <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, and <italic>Lyonnais</italic> financed coal road expansions linking Ukrainian ports and industrial centers and <italic>Halpern</italic> started a private bank in Kiew.\nAmidst the crisis, Greek capitalists in Greece, Egypt, and Constantinople started private <italic>Bank of Mitylene</italic> in Constantinople in 1891, with branches in Izmir, Athens, and the Aegean Island of Mitylene. Within two years, Epaminondas Embiricos, Rodocanachi, Ralli, Baltazzi, Mavrogordatos, and other Chiot diaspora shipping banker cousin-in-laws started <italic>Bank of Athens</italic> in 1893, financing the transition from sail to steam for the Greek fleet. The same year, <italic>London Joint Stock Bank</italic> acquired <italic>Imperial Bank</italic>, which had been formed during America\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic> with investors including <italic>Ralli</italic>, <italic>Rodocanachi</italic><italic>,</italic> <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic><italic> Goldschmidt</italic>, and <italic>Stern</italic><italic>.</italic>\nMeanwhile, across in Romania, Moldova continued to deny Jews land ownership and restricted rural settlement. So, Jews in Moldova leased agricultural estates and dominated trade, banking, and crafts. They accounted for over 75% of merchants in urban Jassy, Boto\u0219ani, and Dorohoi, sustaining commerce through retail networks, transportation, and credit systems, such as banker <italic>Neuschotz</italic>\u2014cousin-in-laws of Rosa Rosenberg Hirsch\u2014in Jassy. \nIn Austrian Galicia, Jews remained active in Lemberg, Brody, and other towns. Since <italic>Vienna-</italic> <italic>Krakau</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Lemberg</italic><italic> </italic>RR passed through his leased land in Auschwitz, textile owner Chaim Schenker kinterlinked with unknown but likely relations of Brody merchants as his daughter married Wolf Landau. Along with founding a tarpaper factory with Schenker\u2019s son-in-law Nathan Wolff, Wolf Landau and his son-in-law Yosef Nathansohn, who had another tarpaper factory, founded <italic>Mercantile Bank</italic> for small traders. Likewise, Schenker\u2019s son Eliezer operated a chemical plant. \nIn Russia, Jewish banking in the northern <italic>Pale</italic> focused on Belarus. Encircling Minsk, most banks were in the border cities: Dvinsk on the Latvian and Lithuanian border, Grodno on the Lithuanian and Polish border, Pinsk near west Ukraine, Rechitsa near the border between east Ukraine and Russia, and Witebsk, Orsha, and Mogilev west of Moscow. Banking in these regions remained predominantly within religious dynasties.\nSince starting in 1873,<italic> Commercial Bank of Minsk</italic> became the largest bank in Belarus. Founded by Christian landowners, guild merchants, including <italic>Louri\u00e9</italic> and <italic>Eliseev</italic>. Alex Wrangel, a Russian-born descendant of Junkers with a large Baltic estate, became Chair. For Vice Director, he hired Chonon Wengeroff, a Minsk tax farmer, who had married Pauline Luria-Epstein, a granddaughter of Luria descendant Simeon Epstein, who was also a cousin of the Gunzburg and Zak bankers. \nWhile Katz-Louri\u00e9 founded <italic>Mutual Credit Society of Pinsk </italic>with their rabbinical cousin Rabinowitz directors and Luria descendant and Katz-husband Rabbi Borukh Epstein as the bookkeeper, <italic>Commercial Bank of Minsk</italic> branched to Pinsk by and ten other branches by the end of the century. Likewise, <italic>Polyakov</italic> banks branched to Belarus and Latvia. While <italic>Azov-Don Bank</italic> had branches in Mogilev, Minsk, Pinsk, and Riga, <italic>Orel Bank</italic> had branches in Bobruisk, Gomel, and Brest. \nAs Gunzburg cousins remained prominent in Witebsk, the Vovsi, Vitenberg, and Shatskes families established banks in Dvinsk. The Latvian Vovsi family claimed Biblical descent, while the Lithuanian Shatskes family held rabbinates in Wilna and Yaneve. While Katz-Eskenasi and many others established Grodno\u2019s <italic>Private Mutual Credit Society</italic> in the 1880s, MM Eliashov, a first guild merchant and Luria-relative of a revered Lithuanian kabbalist, opened the city\u2019s main investment bank in 1896. \nSince the Shaikevich timber merchants of Rechitsa kinterlinked with the freight trading Goldbergs of Neswisch in the 1840s, their offspring kinterlinked with descendants of Chief Rabbi of Bohemia Mordecai Jaffe and played key roles in Pinsk. Their likely cousin, Efim Shaykevich, graduated from <italic>Saint-Petersburg Uni</italic> with a law degree and served in the Senate. As his lawyer brother moved to Paris around 1898, he joined the board of <italic>Saint-Petersburg International Commercial Bank</italic> and later became her Managing Director. From 1900, he held executive roles in <italic>United Cable Works</italic>, <italic>Siemens Halske</italic>, <italic>Public Electricity Co</italic>, and <italic>Electrical Lighting</italic>. Likewise, Efin\u2019s brother-in-law, Gustav Berman\u2014whose father founded a Haskalah school in Saint-Petersburg with Gunzburg\u2019s aid\u2014was a banker and involved in lighting and heating ventures.\nCo-founding <italic>Russian Gold Mining Society</italic><italic> </italic>in 1896, <italic>Gunzburg</italic> marry-partnered with Swiss <italic>Dreyfu\u00df </italic>banker and fellow Katz-descendant sugar magnate Brodsky, kinterlinking closer with Rothschild, Sassoon, Gubbay, Polyakov, and the Jewish banker cousinhood. By then Jacques Dreyfu\u00df retired from <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt, and his nephew and Lazard cousin Lucien Picard became a partner. In 1890, the firm transitioned into a limited partnership with investors including <italic>Basler </italic><italic>Bank</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Suisse</italic>, <italic>Banque de Mulhouse</italic>, and <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Jacob Schiff, whose brother had married Jacques Dreyfu\u00df\u2019s daughter in 1870. The firm opened a branch in Berlin under Picard\u2019s leadership in 1891, and joined the stock exchange clearinghouse. \n<italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel\u2019s invested in electricity companies and railroads in Russia, Switzerland, and France through <italic>Franco-Swiss Bank</italic>, founded by Huguenot Koechlin-in-laws, facilitating the bank\u2019s involvement in the automobile, mechanical engineering, and textile industries. By 1895, <italic>Berliner</italic>-funded <italic>Basler Bank</italic> merged with <italic>Z\u00fcrcher Bank</italic> to form <italic>Basler Z\u00fcrcher Bank</italic>. Within two years, the bank acquired <italic>Schweizerische Unionbank</italic> and <italic>Basler Depositen-Bank</italic>, creating <italic>Schweizerischer</italic>\u2014soon known as <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>\u2014and expanding in Zurich, Basel, and Saint-Gall. \nAs <italic>Basler</italic> Chair Johann Schuster\u2014a Protestant from Strasbourg\u2014became Chair of <italic>Schweizerischer</italic>, he formed the first Swiss bank branch in London in 1898, his son married Toinon Magnez Guttman, a daughter of <italic>Dresdner</italic> Chair Eugen Guttman. An employee of <italic>Basler </italic>at the time, Armand Dreyfu\u00df\u2014an extended cousin of Louis-Dreyfu\u00df and later a <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> in-law\u2014soon managed the Zurich branch, and rose within the bank.\nLikewise, Sassoon cousin Eleazar Kadoorie married into the gold trading family of Laura Mocatta in 1897. Still, resentment of Jewish elites continued. While French authorities investigated Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfus, a cousin of <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> and only Jewish officer on the French army staff, for treason in France, riots targeted Algerian Jews, of whom 53,000 lived in poverty. And, near Ukrainian Kiew, antisemites devastated the houses of Brodsky, Rafalovich, and other Jews until the Governor arrived with Cossacks. \nThe interconnection of banks allowed Jews to intermediate trade. The Russian census of 1897 found that they had a virtual monopoly in agricultural trade within the <italic>Pale</italic>, constituting 37% in trade and banking, with higher percentages in specific regions. 35% of Jews in craft and industrial sectors, dominating with 60% in Belarus-Lithuania, 30% in Poland and Ukraine. Jewish craftsmen, especially in clothing, faced challenges due to overcrowding. Between 1867 and 1880, the population of Riga\u2019s (mostly Hasidic) Jews increased from 5,254 to 20,013, engaging in timber cutting, export, and refining for wood alcohol. \nFrom the Baltic port and forests of Riga, through the woodshops of factories of Belarus in the Pale, with financing from Ukraine, and Azeri oil on the Caspian, religious marriages cemented alliances. Back in the 1860s, Since Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe descendant Schaie Berlin married Chayetta Schneurson, a Katz-descendant and great-granddaughter of the founder of Chabad Hasidim, who affiliated with <italic>Polyakov</italic>, <italic>Halpern</italic> of Berdichev in Ukraine, and other bankers. \nAs Berlin acquired extensive land holdings and established sawmills along the Dvina, his nephew married <italic>Halpern</italic>\u2019s grandson Beynus in 1875, and he soon entered the First Merchant Guild. By the 1890s he owned 75,000 acres of forests on either side of the Dvina. Likewise, the Schneurson and Berlin families kinterlinked and partnered with Shalit, Hindin, and other Hasidim.<italic> </italic>\nBetween Poland and the Grodno towns of Zetel and Dereczin, Jews and peasants rafted timber down the Shchara and Neman rivers for Germany. Key to this trade was the Rabinowitch family. Of unknown relation to the Rabinowitz, this family descended from mid-18th century Rabbi Jacob Havar of Grodno, whose wife\u2019s fourth cousin was Chaya Louri\u00e9, first cousin thrice removed was Chief Rabbi of Moscow Chaim Berlin, and cousin once removed also served as the Rabbi of Grodno and an in-law of the Schneurson family. Two of Havar\u2019s sons served as rabbis in Poland, with Itzchak succeeding from Rozany, Wolkowysk, to Suvalky, while another son, Joseph, served in Knyshin and Jedvabno.\nTwo of Havar\u2019s other sons changed their surnames. Moshe became Rabinowitch and succeeded Joseph as rabbi in Jedvabno. Aaron adopted the surname Pundik, became a businessman in Wilna, and built a synagogue. Moshe\u2019s son Jacob worked as chief cashier for major timber merchant Bregman in Dereczin, while his brother Izik worked under Bregman in Warsaw. Simcha, another son, was a timber merchant in Zetel, and Leib worked in the timber trade in Dereczin. Leib married the daughter of a Lubawich Hasid, while David, another son, married a Katz descendant and cousin-in-law of Chaya Louri\u00e9. Aaron Pundik\u2019s daughter wed Manshe Eliashiv, of unknown relation to Eliashov, but whose father owned large estates near Zetel and Dereczin.\nIn Pinsk, meanwhile, <italic>Louri\u00e9</italic> expanded manufacturing factories to flourmills, sawmills, matches, plywood, and wooden nails for shoes into Belarus\u2019 largest enterprise. Since Katz-descendant and Gunzburg cousin Chaya\u2019s granddaughter married Beynus\u2019 extended cousin Yosef Halpern, Yosef\u2019s son Beni wed Beynus\u2019 niece and later took over <italic>Louri\u00e9</italic>. By 1902, Beni\u2019s cousin (also Chaya\u2019s great-grandson) married Schaie Berlin\u2019s great niece. \nAnother of Chaya\u2019s granddaughters married into the fellow Katz-descendant Minz family, already kinterlinked with the <italic>Rothschild</italic>-affiliated Mises and Vecsler families of Galicia and Moldova, in 1892. While Riga\u2019s Eliezer Ettingen\u2014a Katz-descendant cousin-in-law of Berlin, Gunzburg, Brodsky, Pernes, Rafalovich, Cah\u00e9n, and Nathansohn\u2014drove the creation of Baku kerosene refiner <italic>Mazut</italic> with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, the extended Schneurson cousin and Chief Rabbi of Moscow Chaim Berlin\u2019s niece wed <italic>Mazut</italic> partner Kagan in 1893.\nIn 1892, <italic>Rothschild</italic> and Marcus Samuel\u2014a Sephardi unrelated to Katz\u2014funded <italic>Shell </italic>bulk oil tanker to transport Baku oil from Asia via <italic>Suez</italic>. He soon formed <italic>Samuel</italic> with Abel Smyth, who linked <italic>Shell </italic>and<italic> Burmah Oil</italic>. And since Smyths helped form <italic>Jardine</italic>, interlocked directorates with <italic>Indian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>and <italic>Attock Oil</italic> in west India. \nAfter declining <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s buyout offer in 1893, <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> secured financing from <italic>Boissevain</italic>, both of which were affiliated with <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>. As funds dwindled, <italic>Boissevain</italic> sought support from <italic>OIL</italic> but was rejected as a wildcat before striking oil in 1896. That year, Henri Deterding, formerly of Mennonite trading bank <italic>Twentsche</italic> and <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>, joined <italic>Royal Dutch</italic>. Shortly after, <italic>Boissevain</italic> kinterlinked with Maria Blijdenstein, whose family had established <italic>Twentsche</italic>. \nAt the time, the Dutch elite kinterlinked to lead the domestic and colonial empire politically and commercially. While noble and patrician families produced 19 and 34% of Dutch Second Chamber members, they held 24 and 40% of government minister positions. Likewise, prominent businessmen married into the patrician families, including Calvinist PM Hendrikus Colijn, Aalst of <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>, and <italic>Royal Dutch</italic>\u2019s Deterding. The national and colonial directors were highly integrated, with 80 of 134 national directors holding colonial positions. Among the directors with the most seats from Amsterdam were merchants and Clercq in-laws Eeghen; their in-law banker Heldring; and ship owners Boissevain.  \nPolitical directors included Jacobus Hordijk, an MP representing the Hague and the brother of a former Governor-general, as well as former Governor-General Aart Wijck. Before his term, Wijck directed <italic>Royal Packet Co</italic>, which supported economic expansion and military pacification. After retiring, he became Chair of <italic>Royal Dutch </italic>and a director of multiple colonial companies. Wijck cooperated with Colonial Secretary Jacob Cremer, including on the Mining Act, the conquest of Aceh, and the development of a national oil industry, blocking a takeover bid by <italic>OIL</italic>. Having led the pioneering <italic>Deli Co</italic> in Eastern Sumatra and directing related companies, Coymans-descendant Cremer became President of <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> after this term.\nMeanwhile, after Japan removed export duties on coal in 1888, <italic>Mitsui</italic> began modernizing the Miike colliery. By 1890, <italic>Mitsui</italic> and branched Shanghai, Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Singapore, driving out the Welsh and Australians. However. as Australian strikes cut Japan\u2019s coal imports in 1890, spurring crisis and famine, Japanese banks formed a clearinghouse as the country adopted German bankruptcy and commercial law. To strengthen <italic>Mitsui</italic>\u2019s standing as an Asian exporter, Masuda sought to buy Miike. As <italic>Mitsui Bank</italic> denied a loan, Masuda secured the funding with his personal assets. The modernized Miike proved a major boon for the entire <italic>Mitsui</italic> combine, becoming one of its most valuable assets.\nBy 1892, Russia\u2019s expansion of <italic>Trans-Siberian</italic> RR toward Vladivostok heightened tensions with Japan, which sought overseas opportunities, particularly in Korea. The Tonghak Rebellion in 1894 prompted Japanese intervention, leading to the occupation of Seoul and the ousting of the Korean king. China, historically linked to Korea, sent its fleet to expel the Japanese, starting the <italic>Sino-Japanese War</italic>.\nVictorious in the <italic>Sino-Japanese War </italic>in 1894, Japan forced China to yield Taiwan, grant independence to Korea, and pay an indemnity. For the latter, China turned abroad for funds, and foreign powers pressured China to permit coal roads and mining investment. Unlike ordinary trade, industrial banking politicized as France, Russia, Belgium, and America became interested in securing concessions by 1894. While <italic>Deutsche</italic> cooperated with HSBC in the former, they allied against the Russo-French coalition. Inspired by French <italic>Indochine</italic> and German <italic>Asiatische </italic><italic>Bank</italic> imperial banks, Russia set about creating a similar bank. Like with the Congo earlier, Germany established <italic>Asiatische </italic>in 1889 for equal access to China with funding from <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>,<italic> </italic><italic>Berliner</italic>, and <italic>Nationalbank</italic>. \nMeanwhile, Russian government nationalized railways, including the <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>-affiliated one from 1856. While a syndicate including <italic>Ottoman Bank</italic> and GGE built <italic>Taganrog</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Mariupol</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Donets</italic> RR from 1894 to 1896, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris financed the double-tracking of <italic>Ekaterinodar</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Mariupol</italic> RR and upgrades to Mariupol\u2019s coke ovens, completed in 1897, as <italic>Trans-Siberian</italic> RR advanced past Chelyabinsk toward Irkutsk. \nWitte\u2019s liberalization also led to numerous new banks that could conduct a wide range of business, pushing out private bankers. Founded by <italic>Rafalovich</italic> and <italic>Gunzburg</italic> in 1889, <italic>Odessa Trade & Industrial Commercial Bank </italic>became the Odessa branch of <italic>Russian Bank for Foreign Trade </italic>four years later.  That year, Yakov Polyakov branched <italic>Azov Don Bank of Commerce</italic> to Lodz. While<italic> </italic>German <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> and <italic>Oppenheim</italic>\u2014of unknown relation to the court bankers\u2014operated forwarding companies in Lodz, <italic>Bank Handlowy</italic> branched there by 1896. \nIncreasingly, Germany looked for trading partners. Since Spain\u2019s inaugural PU in 1873 by <italic>Xifr\u00e9</italic> <italic>Dalm\u00e1u</italic> in Barcelona, industrial firms like <italic>Maquinista Terrestre & Maritima </italic>started. By 1890, GGE sponsored<italic> General Madrile\u00f1a de Electricidad</italic> to establish Madrid\u2019s first PU. By 1894, <italic>Berliner </italic>and GGE funded <italic>Sevillana de Electricidad</italic>, before Spain\u2019s other private electric power PUs emerged, including <italic>Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Ib\u00e9rica</italic> in 1901, <italic>Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Espa\u00f1ola</italic> in 1907, <italic>Barcelona Traction </italic>in 1911, and <italic>Uni</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>n El\u00e9ctrica Madrile\u00f1a</italic> in 1912. \nSince the 1850s, Scottish-born John Pender and his British consortium <italic>Imperial</italic> dominated the global submarine cable industry, particularly in the North Atlantic. They enjoyed near-monopoly status, thanks government support to connect India, Australia, and South America across the British Empire with interlocked directorates. While Pender linked British Africa, <italic>India Rubber</italic>\u2019s <italic>West African Telegraph</italic> served French, Spanish, and Portuguese colonies. \nFrom 1894, Germany sought to establish a transatlantic cable, but the British government denied permission to the Azores as a cable hub, fearing competition. With backing from <italic>Felten Guilleaume</italic> and Cologne-based <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, Germany established <italic>Deutsch-Atlantische Telegraph</italic>., which bought a concession from Pender\u2019s British consortium in the Azores and formed an alliance with Mackay\u2019s <italic>Commercial Cable</italic> to prevent price wars that plagued previous Atlantic competitors. Since Pender took over first French trans-Atlantic cable funded by <italic>Erlanger</italic> and <italic>Reuter</italic> in 1873, a second French venture went bankrupt in 1895.\nSince <italic>Indochine</italic> split from <italic>Comptoir</italic><italic> </italic>in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, France questioned <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s concession in 1894, and <italic>Lyonnais</italic> established branches in Egypt, turning into an imperial bank in search of Chinese and Indochinese business. So, <italic>Rothschild </italic>London\u2019s agent Carl Meyer worked with Cassel to reorg Chinese debts. As <italic>Jardine</italic> sold <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> to <italic>Rothschild </italic>Paris and London, she gained control of HSBC since <italic>Russell</italic> failed. With Carl Meyer chairing, HSBC became Britain\u2019s China bank. (<italic>Chartered Bank</italic> remained the Malay bank.) Likewise, <italic>Jardine</italic> funded textile ventures in Hong Kong. To balance with British banks, France renewed <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s 1895 concession and <italic>Lyonnais</italic> joined<italic> Indochine</italic>\u2019s board after withdrawing from Asian activities. \nAfter the premiership Rothschild-in-law Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, ended in 1895, Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, became PM and advanced his nephew Arthur Balfour to First Lord of the Treasury and Leader of the Commons before Balfour succeeded him as PM in 1902. Balfour\u2019s brother Gerald married into the Argyll, Grenfell, and Cavendish families and served as President of the Board of Trade. \nGeorge G\u00f6schen served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The 8th Duke of Devonshire, Spencer Cavendish, held the Council presidency, his nephew held Treasury posts, and the latter\u2019s father-in-law, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, a descendant of Britain\u2019s PM during the <italic>American Revolution</italic>, moved from War Secretary to Foreign Secretary. Other senior ministers came from the same families and institutions, and the same individuals moved through the same posts across the two administrations. \nAs BOE rescued <italic>Baring</italic> in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic> and raised interest rates to stem gold outflows, <italic>Rothschild</italic> imported gold for BOE\u2019s guarantee fund, and banks cartelized as Exchequer Chancellor G\u00f6schen called for higher bank reserves and publicizing accounts. While <italic>National Provincial Bank </italic>and <italic>London & County Bank</italic> already had national networks, others now lunged in. Since acquiring <italic>Union Bank of Birmingham</italic> in 1883, <italic>Midland Bank</italic> bought <italic>Coventry Union Bank</italic>, <italic>Leamington Priors & Warwickshire Bank</italic>, <italic>Derby Commercial Bank</italic>, <italic>Exchange & Discount Bank</italic>, <italic>Leeds & County Bank</italic>, and <italic>Manchester Joint Stock Bank</italic> between 1889 and 1892. \nLikewise, Quaker <italic>Lloyd</italic> grew by buying banks, one of Britain\u2019s oldest Quaker cotton banks failed allegedly due to a correspondents\u2019 embezzlement. After <italic>Barclay Bevan</italic> defensively merged with twenty Quaker cousin banks under Bevan and Smyth-in-law leadership with <italic>Samuel</italic> investment in 1896, <italic>Midland Bank</italic> bought <italic>Bank of Westmorland</italic>, <italic>Preston Banking</italic>, <italic>Carlisle City & District Bank</italic>, <italic>Channel Islands Bank</italic>, <italic>Huddersfield Banking</italic>, <italic>North Western Bank</italic>, <italic>Oldham Joint Stock Bank</italic>, <italic>City of Birmingham Bank</italic>, <italic>Leicestershire Banking</italic>, <italic>Sheffield Union Bank</italic>, and <italic>Yorkshire Banking</italic> by 1901. By then, Britain reintroduced usury laws in 1900 which she repealed in 1854.\n\n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>International Panics at the turn of 20</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> Century </italic>\u2013 Part II\nIn 1887, <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Norddeutsche</italic> founded <italic>German Brazil Bank</italic> in Hamburg, soon spreading to Argentina and Chile. While leaders of a coup hoped to reassure investors, crises continued in Argentina and Uruguay. Chile had a civil war in 1891. Amidst the mining boom, the British linked Bolivia\u2019s Uyuni and Ollague with the port of Antofagasta by 1889, and to the Oruro silver and tin mines from 1892. Brazil\u2019s first Republican Finance Minister created three regional banks. As the currency depreciated, Brazil fell into civil war by 1893. \nWith losses since the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic> and new illiquid real estate loans, Australian banks collapsed as British capital ran that year. <italic>Rothschild</italic> London warned Brazil of invasion, ministers implemented balanced budgets, free trade, and gold convertibility, and burned banknotes. By 1898, politics stabilized, and the government resolved the crisis with a loan. But the stronger currency weakened coffee exporters. \nBefore the <italic>Panic of 18</italic><italic>89</italic>, Italian banks continued to be among Europe\u2019s least profitable and most fragmented. Since medieval times, charitable foundations have typically owned Italian local savings banks and credit institutions. These institutions have traditionally focused on philanthropy over profitability, with bank boards selecting members based on their cultural achievements rather than their expertise. \nHowever, Russian Jews had reinforced connections with <italic>Rothschild </italic>in Italy. While Rafalovich-in-law Henryk Toeplitz and brother Bonawentura of Warsaw, co-founded <italic>Handlowy Bank</italic> in 1870, Bonawentura later directed <italic>Rau</italic>, which had connections with <italic>Laski</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>. Likewise, Toeplitz\u2019s cousin Otto Goldschmidt Joel apprenticed in Genoa at <italic>Bingen</italic> and joined <italic>Banca Generale</italic> as Vice-Director of the Milan branch in 1866, the same year he married a Lutheran pastor\u2019s daughter. \nIn 1881, <italic>Hambro</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Caisse d\u2019Escompte</italic>, and two Italian banks syndicate the Italian currency. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris convinced <italic>Caisse d\u2019Escompte </italic>to withdraw and tried to enter the syndicate for years, <italic>Hambro</italic> did not let them in. The grandson of the Court Jew of Denmark, Everard Hambro, was the first Hambro born in Britain to the baptized founder of <italic>Hambro</italic> London. After joining the firm in 1864, Everard inherited his father\u2019s assets in 1877. His two older brothers held moderate stakes. Within two years, Everard was elected to the Court of BOE. Through leadership in Scandinavian banking, <italic>Hambro</italic> developed a strong relationship with <italic>Hoskier</italic> in France, <italic>Tietgen</italic> and <italic>Privatbanken</italic> in Denmark, and <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Heidelbach Ickelheimer</italic>, and<italic> Phelps Dodge </italic>in America.\nSince <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Egisto Fabbri backed Thomas Edison in developing electricity in 1878, his <italic>Fabbri Chauncey</italic> handled electric light patents for <italic>Edison</italic> Italy. Although Italy soon had nine other electric enterprises\u2014with three backed by <italic>Manzi</italic> of Rome\u2014<italic>Edison</italic> Italy<italic> </italic>soon had the banking of <italic>Banca Generale</italic> as well as <italic>Pisa</italic> and <italic>Treves</italic>, each of which also backed other firms. \nHeir to Italy\u2019s dominant private bank, <italic>Pisa</italic>, Luigi Torre was a militant socialist.<italic> Treves</italic>, meanwhile, was run by Baron Alberto Treves of Venice. While his father\u2019s family were ennobled by Napoleon and married with Morpurgo, Alberto\u2019s mother was born to a Turin banker and her brother kinterlinked with <italic>Samuel Phillips</italic>. By 1884, Treves founded <italic>Terni</italic>, Italy\u2019s inaugural major steel company, and his connections secured crucial government contracts, ensuring <italic>Terni</italic>\u2019s early success.\nIn the 1880s, Italy\u2019s rapid urban development and building speculation highlighted the impact of short-term speculative mindset in banking. As government bonds peaked in 1887, middle-upper class growth collapsed. After Italy extended tariffs in 1887, she began a trade war with France, attracting capital. Since his father joined <italic>Rothschild</italic> in Naples, Frederick Weill worked with his cousins at <italic>Schott Weill</italic>. As Frederick joined <italic>Credito Mobiliare</italic> in 1887, his brother married a Montefiore cousin. \nIn early 1888, amid rumors of a conspiracy against Italy, Minister Magliani proposed a campaign in the German press to regain trust by repurchasing Italian income on the Paris market and persuading German banks to discount the exchange effects of Italian trade. To halt the decline of Italian stock on the Paris stock exchange, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Disconto</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic>, and major Italian banks formed a syndicate resulting in exclusive rights to issue foreign railway bonds from the Italian government.\nWith the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, a scandal brought down <italic>Banca Romana</italic>, one of Italy\u2019s six note issuing banks, in 1891. As <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Trieste agent <italic>Morpurgo</italic> failed in 1891, brother-in-law Leo Rothschild had to bail him out. An extended Morpurgo cousin from one of Italy\u2019s most illustrious Jewish families, Treasurer Luigi Luzzatti attempted to establish a mortgage bank. Despite expectations of support from <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, and <italic>Warschauer</italic>, they only committed to 13% of the nominal capital and refused to join the new bank\u2019s board. \nWhile Luzzatti sought involvement from British and French finance, but these efforts were hindered by the <italic>Baring</italic> crisis in London and political obstacles in Paris. By 1892, <italic>Banca Anglo-Italiana</italic> heir Hamburg Oppenheim cousin Emanuel Leonino married a French Rothschild. With tighter credit since the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, real estate deterioration spread to Italy\u2019s financial system and <italic>Banca Generale</italic> and <italic>Credito Mobiliare</italic> failed during the<italic> Panic of 1893</italic>. Adopting the gold standard, Italy merged the old Parodi institutions and other banks into a central bank, <italic>Banca d\u2019Italia</italic>, the Head of <italic>Pisa</italic>, Israele Pisa, led the Regency Council of Milan from 1894. That year, Emanuel\u2019s cousin Olga Polyakov Leonino married Abraham Rosenberg Warburg.\nMoreover, Anglo-Austro-German banks, including <italic>Deutsche, Dresdner</italic>, <italic>Disconto</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Warschauer</italic>, <italic>Wiener</italic>,<italic> Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s<italic> </italic><italic>Creditanstalt</italic><italic>, Hirsch</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, and <italic>Berliner </italic>established <italic>Banca Commerciale </italic>and another bank in northern Italy. Instead of temporary mediation between industry and banks, banks and enterprises had permanent financial cooperation. <italic>Commerciale</italic> soon developed hydroelectricity, textiles, shipyards, railroads, and heavy machinery plants. <italic>Commerciale</italic> and <italic>Pisa</italic> also replaced <italic>Banca Generale </italic>in the <italic>Edison</italic> Italy pool. <italic>Commerciale</italic> was led by <italic>Banca Generale</italic>\u2019s Otto Goldschmidt Joel\u2014a cousin of Warsaw\u2019s <italic>Commercial Bank</italic>\u2019s Toeplitz\u2014and <italic>Credito Mobiliare</italic>\u2019s Frederick Weill\u2014a<italic> Schott Weill </italic>cousin whose brother had married a Montefiore cousin. \nIn Genoa major banks such as <italic>Bank of Genoa</italic>, <italic>Cassa di Sconto</italic>, <italic>Cassa Generale</italic>, and <italic>Banco Cooperativo Unione Ligure</italic> also suffered significant capital losses. This downturn culminated in the collapse of <italic>Banca Bingen</italic> in 1895, one of Genoa\u2019s largest banks, along with the failure of the Genoa branch of <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic>. While Treves\u2019 <italic>Terni</italic> deposits protected <italic>Bank of Genoa</italic> from default, the bank transitioned into <italic>Credito Italiano</italic> after a capital increase in late 1894 from <italic>Warschauer</italic> and <italic>Nationalbank</italic> of Berlin, <italic>Manzi</italic> of Rome, and <italic>Vonwiller</italic> of Milan, <italic>Banca di Genova</italic>, with Treves soon becoming a leader of <italic>Credito Italiano</italic> and <italic>Edison</italic> Italy. But <italic>Edison</italic> Italy<italic> </italic>soon had to fend off an offensive from GGE and Swiss PUHCs.\nOne of the German electrical engineers who helped industrialize Italy was Hermann Einstein, who dug a canal between Milan and Genoa to power his new plant in 1895. Hermann, who owned an electric motor factory in the nearby Pavia, used hydroelectricity to power electric streetlights. (His son was Albert later gained acclaim in physics.) Family also reinforced corporate links. After Emanuel Oppenheim Leonino\u2019s Rothschild wife died in 1896, their Leonino and Rothschild cousins wed. \nAs <italic>Berliner </italic>founded Zurich-based <italic>Bank f\u00fcr Elektrische</italic> PUHC in 1897 to invest in electric ventures, <italic>Hentsch</italic>\u2019s Ernest Hentsch\u2014head of<italic> Union Financi\u00e8re</italic> and brother of former <italic>Comptoir</italic> banker \u00c9douard Hentsch\u2014founded <italic>Electrique</italic> PUHC in Geneva to consolidate PUs, starting with Italy, with investment from <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Suisse</italic>, <italic>Lombard</italic> <italic>Odier</italic>, <italic>Pictet</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Schneider</italic>, and <italic>Commerciale</italic>. Auguste Boissonnas, a director-founder, managed the company.  The following year, <italic>Franco-Swiss</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, and <italic>Lehideux</italic> formed <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9</italic>, which soon consolidated French electric utilities. \nFrom 1887, <italic>Sprague</italic> electric street railroads spread across America. While <italic>Lee</italic><italic> Higginson</italic>, Thomas Coolidge, and their Peabody and Gardner cousin-in-laws took over <italic>Thomson-Houston Electric Co</italic>, Villard, having left after the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, returned to America on behalf of <italic>Deutsche</italic>, and worked with <italic>Morgan</italic> to take over <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR in 1887. By 1889, <italic>Sullivan </italic>advised Villard to buy out <italic>Edison</italic>, fusing patents with manufacturers into <italic>Edison</italic> with funding, <italic>Siemens</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and<italic> Rockefeller</italic>. \nAfter the passage of AA1890, SSPA, and the failure of<italic> Baring</italic>, <italic>Deutsche </italic>lost confidence in Villard and recalled her loans from <italic>Edison</italic> in the fall of 1890. Although <italic>Riggs</italic> <italic>Peabody </italic>paid British ironmasters for rails partly in railroad stock, the practice was not common. While accepting PU bonds as equipment payment, <italic>Edison</italic> required cash after PUs defaulted in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>. So, <italic>Sullivan</italic> helped GGE <italic>Edison</italic> form a PUHC with a thousand subsidiaries.\nAs Villard merged <italic>Edison</italic>, <italic>Sprague,</italic> and other manufacturers into <italic>American</italic> <italic>General Electric </italic>(\u201cGE\u201d) with financing from <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Lee Higginson</italic>, and Thomas Coolidge, German GGE left the pool in 1892, and <italic>Siemens</italic> spread to Chicago, Britain, and Afro-Eurasia. Since John Morgan\u2019s cousin-in-law <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic>\u2019s Edward Adams was elected President of <italic>Cataract Construction</italic> to tap the hydroelectric potential of Niagara Falls in 1890, he assembled experts which led him to select <italic>Westinghouse</italic>\u2019s alternating current over GE in 1893. \nTo replace Villard that year as her American agent, <italic>Deutsche</italic> selected Adams, who resigned from <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic> and then reorganized <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR. Soon after, Coolidge, a descendant of President Thomas Jefferson and Boston Brahmin, founded <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic><italic> </italic>of Boston in 1900. Coolidge was also a second cousin once removed of <italic>Morgan</italic> partner George Bowdin and fourth cousin of Morgan\u2019s son-in-law Pierson Hamilton, both descendants of inaugural UST Secretary Alex Hamilton.  \nGerman electricity boomed but remained splintered across bank-affiliated joint-stock companies. There were still 39 listed on Berlin\u2019s <italic>Bourse</italic> in 1896. Some were connected. In 1891, Bleichr\u00f6der funded Isidor Loewe\u2019s <italic>Union-Elektrisiert-Gesellschaft </italic>(\u201cUEG\u201d) Austrian military manufacturer to expand into the electricity industry. By 1894, Loewe raised more funds from <italic>Beit</italic> and others to expand UEG\u2019s operations into streetcars. \nLinked to GE, UEG formed BGGE PUHC to buy tramways shares under the leadership of Senator Victor Fris in 1898 with collaboration from Belgian bankers L\u00e9on Cassel and Josse Allard, who became President of <italic>Credit Anversois</italic>. While Leon\u2014a son of Germain Cassel\u2014was a cousin of Speyer, Bischoffsheim, and Halphen, Allard had led infrastructure projects in the late Ottoman Empire. He acquired the former <italic>English Electricity Co</italic> in Salonica in 1906.\nGermany\u2019s 1896 Stock Exchange Law sought to curb speculative trading, particularly futures contracts, by restricting access to qualified participants. While intended to stabilize markets and protect traders, the law destabilized prices. As German banks teetered, <italic>Disconto</italic> took over <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt, and Isaac Dreyfu\u00df joined its supervisory board in 1898. Bloch-cousin Carl Brettauer became director of the Frankfurt branch, and Lazard cousin Picard managed the Berlin branch. \nDue to integration challenges, <italic>Disconto</italic> shut down the Frankfurt branch in 1904. Isaac Dreyfu\u00df re-established <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt that year, with investment from <italic>Disconto</italic>. The revived firm resumed arbitrage and stock exchange commission business. After Isaac\u2019s death in 1909, his son Willy Dreyfu\u00df inherited his capital contribution. Brodsky-in-law Jules Dreyfu\u00df of Basel also became a partner in Frankfurt. <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel was also close to<italic> </italic><italic>Franco-Swiss Bank</italic>, which was founded by Huguenot Koechlin-in-laws.\nBy then, Carl\u2019s brother Eugen Brettauer earned his doctorate and became the legal representative of <italic>Mercur</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> in Vienna by 1891. Brettauer joined the administration of <italic>Bozen-Meran</italic> RR in 1896 and was appointed Deputy Chair of <italic>Mercur</italic> in 1898. Charlotte Kohn had started <italic>Mercur</italic> as a lottery exchange in 1877 but was charged with fraud in 1881. Though later cleared, <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> acquired <italic>Mercur</italic> and formed a board including Brettauer, Albert Koechlin, and Vincenz Morawitz. In 1900, <italic>Mercur</italic> opened a Budapest branch, and in 1903, acquired <italic>Dutschka</italic>, the Vienna partnership of <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, linking the two institutions. Brettauer became Chair and subsequently President as he grew <italic>Mercur</italic>.\nAfter Germany\u2019s Court legalized cartels in 1897, coal cartels formed across Germany. In 1898, Upper Silesian coal industrialist Friedrich Friedl\u00e4nder Fuld, <italic>Arnhold</italic> of Saxony, and <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s Carl F\u00fcrstenberg founded <italic>Oberschlesische Kohlenkonvention</italic>, a closed cartel with long-term contracts. In the same year, they mediated with <italic>Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate</italic> and started the first import of Upper Silesian coal into Berlin and Russia. <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter </italic>bought a stake in<italic> </italic><italic>Mendelssohn</italic><italic> </italic>kinterlinked <italic>Warschauer</italic> of Berlin, and later took her over.\nMeanwhile, German colonial shipping grew. Back in 1847, <italic>Berenberg</italic> <italic>Gossler</italic>, <italic>Merck</italic>, and other Hamburg merchants founded <italic>Hamburg-American Shipping</italic>. <italic>Berenberg</italic> <italic>Gossler</italic>, <italic>Merck</italic>, <italic>Heine</italic>, and other merchants founded <italic>Norddeutsche Bank</italic> in 1856. \nIn 1863, Johann Gossler\u2019s niece married Ferdinand Hertz, a converted descendant of Samuel Oppenheim. Adolph converted to Lutheranism in 1822 and married that year. After training, he began trade with Scandinavia in 1826. He acquired ships from 1837 and expanded trade to China, East India, Africa, and Arabia by 1844. Hertz ended the African and general trade in 1859 and invested in shipping and a shipyard. The company became Hamburg\u2019s largest sailing ship firm and third-largest overall.\nBy 1885,<italic> </italic><italic>Berenberg Gossler</italic> and <italic>Beit</italic><italic> </italic>invested in<italic> </italic>Adolph Woermann\u2019s <italic>German-African Shipping</italic>. Woermann\u2019s father Carl established <italic>Woermann</italic>, exporting linen to Central and South America, Australia, and Southeast Asia. The firm opened branches in Monrovia in 1854, Gabon in 1862, and Cameroon in 1868. In 1885, Adolph separated the shipping arm as with capital from investors including. In 1890, he helped found <italic>German-East </italic><italic>Afr</italic><italic>ican Shipping</italic>.\nIn 1897, Aby Oppenheim Warburg married Ferdinand Hertz\u2019s daughter Mary Gossler Hertz. Within two years, Albert Ballin became President of <italic>Hamburg-American Shipping</italic>, which developed a fleet second only to Germany\u2019s merchant marine in Europe under. Born in Hamburg, Ballin\u2019s father descended from delBanco Warburg and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s grandmother, and operated an emigration agency. Assumed control in the agency, Ballin soon directed <italic>Hamburg-American</italic>\u2019s passenger department and became Chief Executive in 1899. <italic>Hamburg-American </italic>secured capital through <italic>Kuhn</italic> in 1901 and <italic>Warburg</italic> in 1906. Likewise, <italic>Norddeutsche Bank</italic> acquired <italic>Warburg</italic> Altona, whose partners had converted unlike their cousins in Hamburg.\nIn 1898, Goldschmidt-grandson and Oppenheim-in-law Paul Speyer, Head of the London metal trading house <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt</italic>\u2014which dominated Britain\u2019s copper trade\u2014married Olga Warburg (a sister-in-law of Swedish Magnez), cementing metal trade for <italic>Warburg </italic>and <italic>Kuhn</italic>. While Paul Speyer\u2019s third-cousin married into a Sephardi family connected to banker <italic>Maduro</italic> of Cura\u00e7ao and import-exporter Isaac Brandon of Columbian Panama, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Speyer cousin Schiff\u2019s sister wed in 1898 a fellow Katz-cousin Warburg, a cousin of Goldschmidt and Oppenheim<italic>.</italic> \nMoreover, <italic>Seligman</italic> London senior partner wed Katz-descendant and <italic>Ladenburg</italic> in-law Merton of <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> in 1899. Cousins of <italic>Warburg</italic> and <italic>Ladenburg</italic>, <italic>Behrens</italic> of Hamburg and <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> had married Gomperz Montefiore cousins in 1861, and their son Major married Charlotte Rothschild in 1899. Since joining <italic>Metallgesellschaft </italic>with his brother in America in 1892, Carl Loeb\u2014from outside of Frankfurt, unrelated to <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Loeb\u2014married in 1902 Adeline Moses of Alabama, the daughter of the head of the Southern merchant banking family affiliated with the Lehmans.\nAlong with family, the cousinhood reinforced ties through apprenticeships. Max Oppenheim Warburg apprenticed from 1887 to 1891 at <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt, then at <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic> in Amsterdam, followed by <italic>TURK</italic> in Paris, and finally at <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. His brother Paul trained with a trading firm in Hamburg, then at <italic>Samuel Montagu</italic> in London, and later at <italic>Russian Bank for Foreign Trade </italic>in Paris. A year after their brother Felix joined <italic>Kuhn</italic> in New York and married Frieda Schiff in 1895, Paul married Nina Loeb. Their youngest brother, Fritz, apprenticed at <italic>Disconto</italic> in Frankfurt and <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt</italic> in London.\nSince 1895, <italic>Deutsche </italic>spun-off Rathenau\u2019s GGE from <italic>Siemens</italic> to develop European PUs like America\u2019s GE. While<italic> </italic><italic>Deutsche</italic> had opened a London agency in 1873, <italic>Dresdner</italic> followed in 1895 and <italic>Disconto</italic> in 1899, the latter being affiliated with <italic>Hirsch</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic>. By 1895, <italic>Berliner</italic>-funded <italic>Basler Bank</italic> merged with <italic>Z\u00fcrcher </italic><italic>Bank</italic> and acquired <italic>Schweizerische Unionbank</italic> and <italic>Basler Depositen-Bank</italic> by 1897 to create <italic>Schweizerischer</italic>, soon known as <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>. \nAs <italic>Basler</italic> Chair Johann Schuster\u2014a Protestant from Strasbourg\u2014became Chair of <italic>Schweizerischer</italic>, he formed the first Swiss bank branch in London in 1898, his son married Toinon Magnez Guttman, a daughter of <italic>Dresdner</italic> Chair Eugen Guttman. Guttman\u2019s sons also converted and served as assistant directors of <italic>Dresdner</italic> London. Along with Jews, the banks hired Christian patricians. Descended from Rhineland textile magnates, Robert Croon Pferdmenges began his banking career at <italic>Bergisch-M\u00e4rkische Bank</italic>, later joining <italic>Disconto</italic> in 1902. In 1905, he was transferred to London and later to Antwerp to establish a new branch.\nAs <italic>Deutsche </italic>grew, so did Jewish leadership. Like Beit and Speyer-in-law Arthur Gwinner from 1892, some married Jews and converted. While Katz-cousin Hermann Wallich\u2014Count Joseph Cah\u00e9n\u2019s nephew\u2014joined from <italic>Comptoir</italic> and did not practice and baptized his children, Paul Mankiewitz\u2014a descendant  of the aunts of Katz and Samuel Oppenheim\u2014was with <italic>Deutsche</italic> since 1879, joined the Board in 1898, and chaired <italic>North German Lloyd</italic>\u2019s board. After Georg Siemens died in 1901, Beit and Speyer in-law Arthur Gwinner led <italic>Deutsche</italic> and <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s F\u00fcrstenberg became Chair of GGE.\nSince <italic>Cahn</italic>\u2019s Katz-Speyer descended brother-in-law James Nathan \u201cHardy\u201d, transformed <italic>Hardy</italic> into a limited partnership in 1899, Frankfurt-born Fritz Andreae joined as a partner. While a second cousin once removed of Christian Frankfurt banker <italic>Metzler</italic>\u2019s business partner through his father, his mother descended from the Court Jew Halle, who were related to Glikl Pinkerle Goldschmidt\u2019s sister. By 1902, Andreae married GGE founder and Speyer cousin Emil Rathenau\u2019s daughter. Likewise, Andreae\u2019s third cousin married a Bary of <italic>Disconto</italic> Antwerp. Likely related to Hardy, Henry Nathan had worked at <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> in Hamburg and Berlin before entering <italic>Dresdner </italic>in 1895, where he became Deputy Director in 1897 and Board member in 1903. By 1906, Rathenau and Bleichr\u00f6der cousins married. \nLikewise, <italic>Bayerische Vereinsbank</italic> bought out her co-founder, Munich bank <italic>Guggenheimayer</italic>, a co-founder of GGE, in 1892. After selling the bank, Emil Guggenheimayer became a director of engine producer <italic>Maschinenfabrik</italic> <italic>Augsburg N\u00fcrnberg</italic> (\u201cMAN\u201d) by 1903. While Guggenheimayer\u2019s aunt married a Kaulla cousin-in-law, an uncles married a Porges descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, and another uncle married into the Wasserman family. From his family\u2019s Bavarian Court Jew bank <italic>Wassermann</italic>, Oscar Oppenheim Wassermann\u2014a cousin of the Katz, Fuld, Rothschild, and Speyer families, and brother-in-law of Samson Wertheim\u2019s fifth great-granddaughter\u2014joined <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Board in 1912. \nWhile Max Steinthal\u2014a cousin-in-law of Wertheim, Kaulla, and Frankel families\u2014co-founded <italic>Mannesmann Pipes</italic> in 1890 with <italic>Deutsche</italic> and financed real estate, his extended cousin Wilhelm Herz\u2014a cousin-in-law of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Jacob Schiff\u2014chaired the Supervisory Board from 1907. Likewise, <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Management Board added Elkan Heinemann\u2014an in-law of <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt and so connected to Jacob Schiff\u2014from 1908. From 1907, Hermann Wallich\u2019s son Paul gained experience at <italic>Speyer</italic> London, <italic>Deutsche</italic> London, <italic>Cah\u00e9n</italic> in Paris, and <italic>Goldman</italic> in New York, before returning to Berlin to become a director of <italic>Berliner </italic>in 1911.\nAfter France established tariffs in 1892, Britain\u2019s Court legalized cartels in the public interest starting with shipping in 1893, <italic>Borneo Co</italic> joined Singapore\u2019s shipping cartel. Since German Kaiser Wilhelm II supported striking coalers in 1889, advocating international labor reforms, including cartels and female and child employment limits, the <italic>Ruhr</italic> <italic>Coal </italic>cartel formed in 1893. By 1894, <italic>Johnson</italic>,<italic> Quennessen</italic>, and <italic>Heraeus</italic> refiners cartelized into <italic>PLATINUM</italic>. After marry-partnering into <italic>Heraeus</italic>, Charles Engelhard managed American operations. \nIn France, Jewish and Christian bankers reinforced links. From 1895, <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Chair was co-founder Eug\u00e8ne Go\u00fcin. Born into a Christian Touraine banking family that kinterlinked with nobility, his second cousin Ernest was an engineer who married an Eichthal sister-in-law Anna Rodrigues in 1845 and founded rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> in Clichy and Mulhouse with funding from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Pereire</italic>, and <italic>Eichthal </italic>in 1847. \nSoon after <italic>Paribas</italic> formed in the 1870s, Charles Rodrigues Go\u00fcin married a niece-in-law of Flore Oppenheim Ratisbonne,. While Flore\u2019s niece married Charles Demachy, who inherited leadership of Catholic bank <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic><italic> </italic>in 1888, Flore\u2019s aunt had married a Haber banker, whose niece married Jean Ganay in 1888. A descendant of Christian French aristocrats and Astor-cousin Willings of Philadelphia, Ganay\u2019s brother married a Schneider in 1896.\nThe Foulds connected the Pereire and Rodrigues families. Since Katz-descendant Suzanne Gunzburg Fould married Raoul Gradis, a Sephardi shipping heir of Bordeaux, in 1888,<italic> Seligman</italic> London senior partner wed Katz-descendant Merton<italic>,</italic> of <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic><italic> </italic>in 1899. As the daughter of Hortense Camondo Halfon\u2014connected to Romanian oil banker <italic>Marmorosch</italic>\u2014and David Ellissen\u2014a Paris banker descended from Michel Speyer and Samuel Oppenheim, whose brother Albert founded <italic>French</italic> <italic>General Gas Co</italic> and became a Director of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> in 1879\u2014married Max Lazard in 1900, Clotilde Lazard married Edmond Alphand\u00e9ry, of the dynastic Cr\u00e9mieux State Jew clan.\nSimon Lazard\u2019s daughter wed Ren\u00e9 Dupont Fould. A Katz, Speyer, Halphen, and Deutsch-Meurthe descendant, Dupont\u2019s iron magnate father Alphonse Fould<italic> </italic>took <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> public in 1898. His uncle, Salomon Halfon, Eug\u00e8ne Pereire\u2019s son-in-law, secured Ren\u00e9 boards seats at <italic>Penho\u00ebt</italic> shipyard and <italic>Transatlantique Shipping</italic>. \nLikewise, a Deutsch-Meurthe wed a Rosenberg Gunzburg. Having kinterlinked with <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df </italic>in 1886 and Rosenberg Gunzburg in 1888, Galician coaler <italic>Gutmann</italic> wed the niece of Bohemian banker and oil refiner Alfons Thorsch in 1898. As a banker, Thorsch also amagmlated industry. Since his second cousin Marienne Porges Goldschmidt married Otto Lieben Brandies Margulies\u2014whose father co-founded <italic>Kali-Bergbau- und Salinen</italic> to exploit potassium salts discovered by Margulies in the Kalusz saline in Galicia\u2014Margulies and Thorsch sold the enterprise in 1903 to <italic>Aktiengesellschaft f\u00fcr </italic><italic>C</italic><italic>hemische Industrie</italic>, which became the <italic>\u00d6sterreichischen Chemischen Werke</italic> in 1905.\nWith high dividends since the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, Rand mines boomed from 1894. French investments surged with <italic>Banque Internationale de Paris</italic>\u2014founded by Parisian Frankfurters Georges May and Jacques Kulp, allied with K\u00f6nigswarter\u2014and syndicates, <italic>Porges</italic> <italic>Ephrussi</italic>, involving Michel Ephrussi; <italic>Porges</italic> <italic>Kann</italic>, which worked with Rodolphe Kann and brokers like <italic>MacSwiney</italic>; and <italic>Neumann</italic> <italic>Gunzburg</italic>, with Porges cousin-in-law Sigismund Neumann and Jacques Gunzburg. \nWith growing African mining speculation,<italic> Rothschild</italic> led <italic>Hirsch</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Beit</italic>, and others to control mining. Likewise, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC launched <italic>Rand Mines</italic>, <italic>Geldenhuis</italic>, <italic>Mashonaland </italic><italic>Goldfields</italic>, <italic>Consolidated</italic>, <italic>Jumpers</italic>, and <italic>Transvaal & General Association</italic>. To stabilize the market, <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise de L\u2019Afrique du Sud</italic>, started in early 1895 to promote deep-level Transvaal mining with<italic> </italic>President Jacques Siegfried, VP Ernest May, and Jacques Gunzburg.\nSince refusing stabilizing monopolization ventures for copper, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London parlayed <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC funds to buy <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s <italic>Rio Tinto</italic><italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic>join <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, Cassel, <italic>Lewisohn</italic>, <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt</italic>, and others to cartelize global copper into <italic>COPPER </italic>using <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> as counsel. \nMoreover, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London diversified <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC since the failure of <italic>Baring </italic>in 1890 into mines across Australia, Mexico, and Alaska, and with the safer London PUs in 1895. Since <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC became a joint stock in 1889 faced a backlash against founders\u2019 shares, which entitled founders to a disproportionate share of profits. This led to the abolition of founders\u2019 shares, although the founders were compensated with half the company\u2019s capital at par. While <italic>Smyth</italic>\u2019s Gerard Smyth became a director in 1895, <italic>DeBeers</italic> re-cartelized diamonds. After brokering diamonds, the Oppenheimers moved to Frankfurt, where teenage Ernest joined his brother Bernhard at <italic>Dunkelsbuhler</italic>.  \nBut as diplomatic tension between Germany and Britain about Africa grew, the dominant German African <italic>Berliner </italic>lost interest in colonies. By then, European missionaries, merchants, and consular officials documented massacres and atrocities against the Congolese. Affiliated with Britain\u2019s crown prince, the Countess of Warwick asked Rhodes for a concession in 1895. Gaining an area north of the Zambezi River, her <italic>Warwick </italic>broker set out to organize financing. \nSince Britain colonized Ashanti Ghana in 1874, Ashanti chiefs continued to rule as they had for a millennium. Resisting British rule, nationalists protested for the return of the king in 1900 while Queen Mother Yaa Asantewaa led fierce resistance for a year before she was captured and Britain annexed Ashanti for direct rule in 1901. Gold prices soared with the simultaneous <italic>Anglo-Boer War</italic> over South Africa between 1899 and 1902. While <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Afrique du Sud </italic>President Jacques Siegfried promoted deep-level Transvaal mining shares until his resignation in early 1899 due to his pro-Boer views. Ernest May, the bank\u2019s VP, and Jacques Gunzburg took over management.\nWhile May\u2019s cousin-in-laws married had kinterlinked with a Goldschmidt May Rosenthal of <italic>Lippman</italic><italic>n</italic><italic> Rosenthal</italic> and Becker Fuld by 1886 and Goldschmidts of <italic>Lippert</italic> by 1897, his daughters married a Worms in 1903 and a Lazard\u2014related to the Goldschmidts and, through the Foulds, to the Gunzburgs\u2014by 1905. In between, <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Afrique du Sud </italic>and <italic>Banque Internationale de Paris</italic> merged to form <italic>Banque Commerce et l\u2019Industrie</italic> in 1901, with backing from <italic>Gunzburg</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Comptoir</italic>, and former Finance Minister Maurice Rouvier as President. \nRouvier initially led the bank but left for government service in 1902, become Finance Minister in 1905, and returning in 1906. During his absence, May and other bank representatives shifted the focus to Franco-German economic cooperation and international bonds. With <italic>Beit</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Lippert</italic>, <italic>Mosenthal</italic>, <italic>Oppenheimer</italic>, <italic>Barnato</italic>, and others German-speak Jewish gold trade financiers industrializing South Africa for decades, antisemites branded the war a \u2018Jewish war\u2019, even though Beit and others converted.\nAlready responsible for Montana and Michigan copper,<italic> Lewisohn</italic> expanded to Tennessee and Florida. While <italic>ALUM</italic> did not fix prices per AA1890, she split geographic competition with GGE\u2019s Swiss trust and agreed not to compete with Europe. However, <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> continued to sell across various regions, and <italic>ALUM</italic> chose not to renew the agreement in 1896. \nThey expanded their operations to Canada, seeking to monopolize North American activities. Without coordination, the Swiss trust proposed an international cartel with <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> to align their activities. Platinum competition increased as Russia allowed foreign investment. By 1899, <italic>Oppenh</italic><italic>y</italic><italic>m</italic> and other French bankers monopolized Russia platinum. So, <italic>PLATINUM</italic> refocused on America.\nHirsch also parlayed the exodus of Russian Jews to industrialize British Canada. He worked with the rabbinical Cohens. Immigrating from Russian Poland, Lazarus Cohen developed a reputation as a merchant and lumberman in Maberly, Ontario. In the 1880s, Lazarus relocated to Montreal and expanded his business ventures into coal transport. From 1896, his dredge fleet took on a government contract to deepen tributaries of the Saint-Lawrence River from Lake Ontario to Quebec. \nThe family brothers actively supported Maurice Hirsch\u2019s efforts for recolonizing Russian Jews in Canada during his lifetime and after. As Hirsch died in 1896, Cassel joined <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>\u2019s board and took over <italic>Hirsch</italic>. While <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Schiff, Leonard Cohen-Barent Montefiore, and others led Hirsch\u2019s colonization trust, Britain set a precedent with a death tax. \nSince a <italic>Rapha\u00ebl </italic>heir\u2014of the gold and silver refiner turned one of London\u2019s largest merchant banks\u2014married a Katz-Merton in 1892 and a Sassoon the following year, gold broker <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> (a Cohen-Barent cousin unaffiliated with Katz-Samuel-Rothschild or Governor Montagu\u2019s families) wed a Goldsmid of <italic>Goldsmid Mocatta</italic> in 1898. Along with <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s <italic>Royal Mint Refinery</italic> and the Christian <italic>Johnson</italic>, <italic>Sharp</italic>, and <italic>Pixley</italic>, refiners soon entered price fixing agreements for treating gold. \nAs a Goldschmidt cousin wed oil heiress Deutsch-Meurthe in 1898, Lucie Goldschmidt married Andr\u00e9 Lazard. While her parents disapproved that marriage, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Alexandre Weill arranged a marriage for his son David with Flora Rapha\u00ebl as he joined <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. At the time, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris financed Moroccan land, Spanish mining interests, Colombian emerald mines, Egyptian sugar mills, Argentine government loans, <italic>London Telegraph Co</italic>, and other ventures. She also invested in the Russian fur trade and provided credits to <italic>Siberian Bank of Commerce</italic>. <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris maintained relationships with Huguenot houses like <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Vernes</italic>, <italic>Mallet</italic>, and <italic>Neuflize</italic>, as well as Jewish banking interests such as <italic>Stern</italic>, <italic>Cah\u00e9n</italic>, <italic>Rapha\u00ebl</italic>, <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, and <italic>Heine</italic>.\nMeanwhile, Lucie Goldschmidt\u2019s sister Claire married Ernest Heilbronn, who co-founded bank <italic>Heilbronn Herrmann</italic> in Paris with Claire\u2019s cousin Gustave Herrmann. The father of Ernest was F\u00fcrth-born Julius-Jules Heilbronn, a Wertheim and Rindskopf cousin, who moved to Paris and kinterlinked with <italic>Stern</italic>. By 1894, Ernest\u2019s sister married Richard Thalmann, whose brother co-founded <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann </italic>in New York. \nSince Isaac Pereire\u2019s <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> founded <italic>Transatlantique Shipping </italic>during Napoleon III\u2019s reign, <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic>, started in 1865, spread across southern France and northern Africa. <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic>\u2019s directors included the Christian Pastre family, related to the Goldschmidt since 1881. In that year, <italic>Transatlantique Shipping</italic> formed <italic>Transatlantique Bank</italic>, integrating with shipbuilding and other companies. Among the directors of this venture included \nOriginally for sanitation,<italic> Works of Marseille</italic> built power plants from 1898 and created <italic>Mediterranean Coast Electric</italic>, becoming France\u2019s leading public works company by 1908. By then Katz-descendant Suzanne Gunzburg Fould married Sephardi shipping heir of Bordeaux Raoul Gradis in 1888,<italic> </italic>Simon Lazard\u2019s daughter wed Ren\u00e9 Dupont Fould\u2014a Katz, Speyer, Halphen, and Deutsch-Meurthe descendant\u2014after his iron magnate father Alphonse Fould<italic> </italic>took <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> public in 1898. Ren\u00e9\u2019s uncle, Salomon Halfon, Eug\u00e8ne Pereire\u2019s son-in-law, secured Ren\u00e9 boards seats at <italic>Penho\u00ebt</italic> shipyard and <italic>Transatlantique Shipping</italic>. While Raymond Lazard married a daughter of <italic>Transatlantique</italic>\u2019s Jacque Lumbroso in 1903, Jacques Pereire married Fould cousin and <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> heiress<italic> </italic>Ad\u00e8le Halphen Dupont the following year.\nWith investments ranging from oil works and cotton ginning in Dahomey and Togo, CFAO and other Marseille and Bordeaux merchants and shipowners, reorganized <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic> into <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> (\u201cBFWA\u201d) in 1901, with the right to issue currency across Black West French Africa, expanding into Equatorial Africa, Togo, and Cameroon. The capital was allocated with 60% for Bordeaux, 20% for <italic>Comptoir</italic>, and 20% for CFAO and other Marseille stakeholders. \nHaving banking Cecil Rhodes and served as general manager of <italic>Standard Bank</italic> since the 1890s, Cornwall-born Lewis Michell he retired from banking, became Chair of <italic>DeBeers</italic>, and joined the board of <italic>British South Africa Co</italic>. From 1894, Earl Albert Grey replaced Cecil Rhodes as the Administrator of Southern Rhodesia until becoming director of <italic>British South Africa </italic><italic>Co </italic>in 1898 and urging development. \nAs Britain and Germany agreed to partition Portuguese colonies for development, Rhodes extended <italic>Warwick</italic>\u2019s concession from Cape Town to Cairo. But as the contract had unprofitable geographic profit restrictions,<italic> Warwick</italic> failed to find financing. As Cassel\u2019s <italic>Hirsch</italic> took over the railroad contract in 1899 with <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent, <italic>Lambert</italic>, they formed <italic>Tanganyika Concessions</italic> with support Rhodes. Despite this small participation, King Leo\u2019s Free State created <italic>Comit\u00e9</italic> with broad administrative powers in 1900 with investors including <italic>Lambert</italic> and William Mackinnon.\nWith the rise of the German Empire, Frankfurt and other provincial centers lost their shine.<italic> Speyer</italic> Frankfurt came under the leadership of Eduard Beit after his father-in-law died in 1902. Cousin of <italic>British South Africa Co</italic>\u2019s banker Alfred, Eduard married Gustav Speyer\u2019s daughter in 1892, and added her surname to his.\nSince <italic>Beyfus</italic>\u2014kinterlinked with <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, and <italic>Haber</italic>\u2014restructured as a partnership with <italic>Steiger</italic>\u2014ennobled Christian Swiss in-laws of Bethmann\u2014in 1857, <italic>Stigler</italic><italic> </italic>heir Louis Steiger liquidated the firm as he joined <italic>Dresdner</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Dresdner</italic> absorbed <italic>Erlanger</italic> of Frankfurt in 1904.\nAs the head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, Wilhelm, died in 1901, the family dissolved the branch for want of an heir. Despite a request from the Kaiser for a German <italic>Rothschild</italic> presence, the family refused, possibly due to antisemitism. While <italic>Disconto</italic> picked up her business, Wilhelm\u2019s son-in-law Maximilian Goldschmidt added the surname Rothschild to his after the death of his wife. As the wealthiest individual in Germany, he led <italic>Goldschmidt Rothschild </italic>in Frankfurt. \n<italic>Ladenburg</italic> Mannheim dissolved in 1903, soon becoming part of <italic>Disconto</italic>. As Katz-cousin and Luria descendant Adolph Salomonsohn led <italic>Disconto</italic>, his brother Arthur served in a Potsdam Regiment in the late 1870s before studying law and establishing a law practice. By 1888, he joined <italic>Disconto</italic> and represented German creditors during Argentina\u2019s 1891 financial crisis. He also played a crucial role in securing the construction of <italic>Great Venezuela </italic>RR from 1903 to 1905 and married a Katz Warburg descendant during that time.\nAfter John Morgan\u2019s cousin-in-law <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic>\u2019s Edward Adams was elected President of <italic>Cataract Construction</italic> to tap the hydroelectric potential of Niagara Falls, he assembled experts which led him to select <italic>Westinghouse</italic>\u2019s alternating current over GE in 1893. To replace Henry Villard that year as her American agent, <italic>Deutsche</italic> selected Adams, who resigned from <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic> to represent <italic>Deutsche</italic> in America. By 1895, GE and <italic>Westinghouse</italic> pooled patents to end the litigation in 1897. \nThe same year, with financing from <italic>Glyn </italic>and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, Cassel facilitated the mergers of <italic>Barrow Naval & Shipbuilding Co</italic> and <italic>Maxim-Nordenfelt Guns </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Ammunition Co</italic> into <italic>Vickers</italic>, which became Britain\u2019s leading ship and arms engineer. But unlike <italic>Speyer</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Kleinwort </italic>and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> financed German industrial firms and Anglo-German houses in Britain with acceptances. Since <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> cousin and partner Julius Schwabach kinterlinked with <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic> of<italic> </italic>Amsterdam, Schwabach\u2019s son married a <italic>Schr\u00f6der </italic>cousin of Hamburg by 1898<italic>.</italic>\n<italic>Westinghouse</italic> retained <italic>Benson</italic> to float <italic>Westinghouse</italic> Britain in 1899. As BGE expanded across the British Empire, Germany\u2019s GGE sought to acquire her, but Hirst refused and incorporated in 1900. Few British collieries merged, but electricity grew exports. Since Parliament had localized regulation, cities protected coal-based gas PUs. Since 1824, Britain\u2019s <italic>Imperial Continental Gas Association</italic> (\u201cICGA\u201d) continued operating, reaching in twelve major and 29 smaller European cities by the turn of the century. Through decades of war and nationalizations that would follow, ICGA survived into the 1970s. \nSince 1893, Polyakov entered the Persian cotton market. His losses rapidly increased, and he resorted to bookkeeping tricks, even purchasing a textile mill in Parnu to reduce <italic>Russo-Persian</italic><italic> Bank</italic> debt. Moreover, Lazar speculated on American cotton, conducting transactions in New York, Liverpool, and Alexandria. \nWith the growth of state credit from the 1880s, Jewish private bankers did not play the central role in Russian imperial finance that they had held since the 1860s. Instead, Tsar Alex II Romanov named Sergei Witte Finance Minister in 1892. Witte himself had a small amount Jewish blood and was married to a Jewess. Within two years, Russia promulgated additional rules to regulate their opening, granting Witte the right to inspect and audit their operations. However, despite these measures, the government still struggled to establish effective control over their activities. \nLikewise, before his death in 1894, the Tsar tasked Witte with alcohol excise tax reform, ostensibly for public health. While Witte replaced the tax with a state monopoly on vodka sales, Russia prioritized state revenue over citizen welfare. Russia also promoted <italic>Raiffeisen</italic>-style credit unions. Savings loan societies multiplied after 1898, credit societies formed after the 1895 law, community savings loan funds were established by a 1904 law, and state savings banks spread soon after.\nSince moving from Odessa to Paris in the 1880s, Artur Levinsohn Rafalovich married a Wertheim, he became Witte\u2019s French agent from 1894, even though he remained Jewish unless much of his family in France. While Halpern\u2019s bank filed for bankruptcy after opening three years earlier, Lazar Polyakov wed his daughter to Venetian noble Georges Levi in 1895 and sought to form <italic>Italian-Russian People\u2019s Bank</italic> in Rome. Despite Polyakov\u2019s continuing loyalty to the Tsar, Moscow denied them to hold public services at their private synagogue. Since Polyakov founded <italic>Southern Russia Coal </italic>was in 1872, <italic>Banque Internationale de Paris</italic> invested in 1891. By 1897, during a capital increase, French control over <italic>Southern Russia Coal</italic>.\nDespite local politics, Russia needed funds as geopolitics evolved. As Rafalovich negotiated with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and London, Witte\u2019s appointed Gregory Vilenkin his New York agent by 1897 to negotiate with <italic>Kuhn</italic>. Since Wilna merchant Gregory Vilenkin received a law degree in 1887, he served on Russian ministerial affairs in London. There, he married Schiff cousin Irma Seligman in 1895. Abram\u2019s sister soon married Polyakov in-law Genrikh Vydrin. Likewise, Witte retained Berlin-born Adolph Rothstein in 1895. A cousin-in-law <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s Carl F\u00fcrstenberg and Silesian coal magnate Emanuel Friedl\u00e4nder, Rothstein was an agent of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris.\nSince Amin Hajj\u2019s monetary reforms and extensive investments, he faced accusations of debasing coinage. In 1893, he transferred control of the mint, leading to the establishment of a new position to address coin quality concerns. In 1894, he submitted a higher bid for the mint farm with a partner and subsequently reclaimed control in 1895. As copper coinage increased, the gap with silver widened, which benefited Amin. However, in 1897, he was arrested, fined, and banished from the mint. In 1898, he secured a contract to manage the mint with a new syndicate. The same year, Amin was assigned to supervise grain prices during a famine in the capital city, passing away in the same year.\nOver this time, Bukhara continued growing. By 1890, Jewish Moisey Flaxman established cotton cleaning plants, which expanded for decades. As Russia\u2019s <italic>Imperial State Bank</italic> opened a Bukharan branch in 1894, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Lyonnais</italic> joined with Russian Finance Minister Witte and <italic>Saint-Petersburg International Commercial Bank</italic> to establish <italic>Russo-Chinese Bank</italic> under the leadership of Adolph Rothstein. That year, Russia signed a secret treaty with China, gaining the right to extend <italic>Trans-Siberian</italic> RR through Manchuria to Vladivostok. \nLikewise, China signed a contract with <italic>Russo-Chinese Bank</italic> to construct and operate <italic>Eastern Chinese</italic> RR. Second guild Jewish merchant Wolf Komarovski became a director of <italic>Russo-Chinese Bank</italic>\u2019s Urgench branch in Uzbekistan. As poor Ashkenazi Jews moved to Bukhara in search of work, labor competition grew. So, while Russia targeted recent immigrants into the region from 1888, the Tsar broadly annulled their property rights in 1899, he restricted their movement to mirror that of Ashkenazim the following year.\nSo, Jews focused on the <italic>Pale</italic>. While <italic>Gunzburg</italic>, <italic>Russo-Chinese Bank</italic>\u2019s Adolph Rothstein, <italic>Saint-Petersburg International Commercial Bank</italic>, <italic>Paris-Holland Bank</italic>, and <italic>Banque Internationale de Paris</italic> established <italic>Russian Gold Mining Society</italic><italic> </italic>in 1896, <italic>Gunzburg,</italic> <italic>Rafalovich</italic>, and <italic>Ephrussi</italic> founded<italic> Commercial & Industrial Bank of Odessa</italic>, and <italic>Polyakov</italic>\u2019s <italic>Azov-Don Commercial Bank</italic> branched to Kharkov with Rubinstein in-laws in 1897, followed by <italic>Land Bank</italic> in 1898, and <italic>Trade Bank</italic> in 1899. \nLikewise, Zionists out of Cologne founded <italic>Colonial Bank of Palestine</italic>. While Louri\u00e9-controlled <italic>Louri\u00e9</italic> bank, <italic>Mutual Credit Society</italic>, and <italic>Commercial Bank of Minsk</italic> Pinsk became large investors, Witte delegalized promotion. Moreover, Russia limited the proportion of Jews in Moscow\u2019s First Merchants Guild to just one third to satisfy Old Believers. \nLike in America, Austro-German industrialization fueled real estate, corporate consolidation, and labor unrest that the government struggled to address. By 1896, Germany\u2019s Stock Exchange Law sought to curb speculative trading, particularly futures contracts, by restricting access to qualified participants. While intended to stabilize markets and protect traders, the law destabilized prices. \nWhile <italic>Treber-Trocknung</italic> sought to create a European drying grain and malt residue monopoly with<italic> Leipziger Bank</italic>, <italic>Treber-Trocknung </italic>debts led <italic>Leipziger </italic>to suspend payments in 1901. Efforts to secure support from <italic>Deutsche</italic> failed and <italic>Leipziger </italic>filed for bankruptcy. <italic>Disconto</italic> took over <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt, and Isaac Dreyfu\u00df joined its supervisory board in 1898. Due to integration challenges, <italic>Disconto</italic> shut down the Frankfurt branch in 1904. Isaac Dreyfu\u00df re-established <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt that year, with investment from <italic>Disconto</italic>. The revived firm resumed arbitrage and stock exchange commission business.\nWhile <italic>Deutsche </italic>formed an alliance with <italic>Schlesische</italic><italic> </italic>of Breslau, one of her original co-founders, in 1897,<italic> </italic><italic>Cahn</italic> of Bonn transformed into <italic>Westdeutsche </italic>in 1896 and acquired <italic>Solmitz Cohen</italic> in Cologne in 1898. Amidst this consolidation, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, and <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic> joined mortgage banks to finance real estate finance. As mortgage obligations of German mortgage banks rivaled Prussian State bonds, raising security concerns. This led to the Mortgage Bank Law to protect hypothecary claims but also restricted market flexibility. \nIn 1900, <italic>Prussian Mortgage </italic>faced insolvency due to speculative investments, prompting a reorg by issuing new stock and reducing bond values. In 1901, the bankrupt <italic>German Mortgage </italic>went converted into a real estate company to slow its liquidation While <italic>Pomeranian Mortgage </italic>also restructured its bonds and issued stock to reduce bondholder claims, <italic>Westdeutsche </italic>merged with <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic> in 1904 and required support from <italic>Dresdner</italic>. The same year, <italic>Norddeutsche Bank</italic> of Hamburg acquired <italic>Warburg</italic> Altona, whose partners had converted unlike their cousins in Hamburg.\nWhen the first congress of Austrian mine workers was held in 1890, the most important matters discussed were the 8-hour workday, abolition of contract work, and central federated union. However, the congress of 1898 was marked by dissension above the eight-hour day, minimum wage, and mine safety. Shortages spurred layoffs and spread to Galician Boryslaw\u2019s oil industry through to industrial Russia and Germany. \nWhile the bankruptcy of Galician oil refiner Stanistaw Szczepanowski pushed <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic> to the brink of collapse and Szczepanowski died soon after. Likewise, <italic>Galician Credit Bank</italic>, was forced Adam Sapieha to return several million <italic>crowns</italic> to depositors. While <italic>Union </italic><italic>Bank of Vienna</italic>-funded <italic>Galician Bank for Trade & Industry</italic> acquired <italic>Galician Credit Bank</italic>, she required aid from <italic>Galician National Bank</italic> in 1902. \nAs the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic><italic> </italic>squeezed UEG and other PUs in Germany,<italic> Citi</italic> NB and <italic>Kuhn</italic> supported Germany. After establishing <italic>Bank for Brewing </italic>that year, <italic>Arnhold</italic> reorganized <italic>Kummer Works</italic> of Dresden into<italic> Saxon Light & Power</italic> in 1901. In Russia, the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic> caused a severe coal shortage, leading to measures to restrict prices and suppress coal rings and syndicates. The crisis resulted from a breakdown of the new economy that emerged in the previous decade, hitting new enterprises, particularly those connected to railways, and suffering from devalued stock and large inventories. As famine spread, Russia and Romania dumped oil. Antisemitism combined with the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic> to fell <italic>Derviz</italic> in Moscow, <italic>Weinbaum</italic> in Kiew failed, and <italic>Mamontov</italic> in Voronezhy.\nSince founding <italic>Kharkov Land Bank</italic> in 1871 and working closely with Lazar Polyakov, Christian coal banker Alexey Alchevsky, faced a financial collapse after the <italic>Panic of 1899 </italic>as <italic>Imperial State Bank</italic> (\u201c<italic>State Bank</italic>\u201d) branched to Kharkov, and committed suicide in June 1901. As the bonds of Lazar Polyakov\u2019s <italic>Moscow State Bank </italic>came due, an audit revealed inflated book values and liabilities exceeding assets. Despite Tsar Nicholas II Romanov\u2019s desire to remove Polyakov, Finance Minister Sergei Witte warned about the financial risks. \nTo prevent crisis, <italic>Polyakov</italic> came under <italic>State Bank</italic>, which discounted railway bonds to service debts. To stabilize the banking sector, Witte also deposited railway securities in banks, allowing <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>\u2019s Russian subsidiary, <italic>Northern Bank</italic>,<italic> </italic>to manage and offload its investments. As Lazar\u2019s son wed a Brodsky that year, Polyakov refused to sell to Witte. So, Witte sold the state\u2019s shares to <italic>Saint-Petersburg Discount Bank.</italic>\nTo cope with losses and depleted reserves, Russian entrepreneurs and managers sought new capital, which often demanded privileged positions over existing capital. Financial reorganizations, such as issuing preference shares, converting debts into shares, or reducing old shares\u2019 value, became common. The crisis led businesses to enter syndicates and monopolistic agreements, resulting in the concentration of heavy industry. The crisis also forced many Franco-Belgian investments into bankruptcy. \nAlthough farmers prevented monopolization by railing against high tariffs and taxes, Europeans cartelized commodities. By 1902, <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>\u2019s <italic>Northern Bank</italic> cartelized Ukrainian coal and metallurgy plants into <italic>Prodamet</italic>. Similarly, German BHCs cartelized European kerosene and developed colonial value chains. \nAmidst the stabilization, Polyakov declared bankruptcy in late 1904 and a Christian from the Ministry of Finance directed <italic>Russo-Chinese Bank</italic> from 1905. Likewise, the Knoops\u2014who had supplied and invested in the Morozov and other Old Believer since the 1840s\u2014joined the boards of <italic>Merchant</italic> and <italic>Accounting</italic> banks. Affiliated with <italic>Russo-Chinese </italic>and Old Believer textile magnates, the Knoop family oversaw the Central Asian cotton business. \nWhile <italic>Merchant Bank</italic> of Saint-Petersburg financed Knoop\u2019s cotton purchases in Central Asia and acquired cotton processing enterprises,<italic> </italic>Knoop\u2019s British <italic>DeJersey Bank</italic> lent to Moscow textile manufacturers secured by Liverpool contracts. By the 1880s, <italic>Knoop</italic> was <italic>Deutsche</italic> Bremen\u2019s largest and most important client. Although some Knoops were Russian-born, they were regarded as Germans. Still, the families kinterlinked with industrialists and financiers from Britain to Russia, including in-laws of <italic>Huth</italic>\u2019s Meinertzhagen of London, <italic>Mendelssohn </italic>of Berlin, and, within a decade, Mamontov-in-laws of <italic>Morozov</italic> of Moscow. \nInstead of Jews, a descendant of the Dukes of Courland, Bark grew <italic>State Bank</italic>. Born outside of Kiew, Bark graduated from <italic>Lutheran Church School</italic> of Saint-Anne in Saint-Petersburg in 1887 before attending <italic>Saint-Petersburg Uni</italic> Law until 1892. He joined the <italic>Ministry of Finance</italic>\u2019s Credit Chancellery in 1891 and rose through the ranks. By 1894, Bark was appointed as an officer on special assignments at <italic>State Bank</italic>, followed by various key positions within the bank, including Director of <italic>Overseas Operations</italic>. By 1900 he married a fellow cousin of the Dukes of Courland and cousin-in-law of an ennobled converted Oppenheim related to <italic>Mendelssohn.</italic>\nAfter Bark was elected Deputy Chair of the newly formed council of <italic>Saint-Petersburg Stock Exchange</italic> in 1901, he acted as private secretary to the Governor of <italic>State Bank</italic>, and in 1903 went to Berlin to study banking with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>. On his return he was appointed Manager of <italic>State Bank</italic>\u2019s <italic>Foreign Department</italic>, of which he soon became Deputy Governor, and subsequently the Head of <italic>State Bank</italic> Saint-Petersburg by 1905. He resigned this post to accept an appointment with <italic>Volga-Kama Bank</italic>.\nAmidst geo-political flux, China\u2019s International Settlement guild\u2019s competitive qianzhuang could not honor their tiepiao and some money shops failed in the <italic>Panic of 1897</italic>. Within months Britain\u2019s <italic>Foreign Office</italic> directed HSBC to prevent the sale of a Chinese railroad to Russia as <italic>Imperial State Bank</italic> nationalized<italic> </italic><italic>Polyakov\u2019</italic>s <italic>Russo-Persian</italic><italic> Bank </italic>and <italic>Russo-</italic><italic>Chinese Bank </italic>into <italic>Russo-Chinese Bank</italic>, continuing to mostly service Bukharan Jews in Central Asia. As part of the 1898 treaty between Russia and China, China leased land in Manchuria for Russia to form the city of Harbin. Harbin became a crucial point on <italic>Chinese Eastern</italic> RR, connecting Irkutsk and Chita to the Russian Pacific port of Vladivostok. \nHarbin had large pockets of emigrant minorities, including Jews, who were granted unique freedoms in the railway zone to encourage migration. The Jewish community in Harbin grew as entrepreneurs exchanged goods with various regions but grew with each European conflict. While Belgian sent consul to China in 1897 to search for concessions for a state loan to China to construct <italic>Pekin-Hankow</italic> RR (Beijing to Guangzhou). However,<italic> American China Development </italic>secured the concession instead. By 1898, <italic>Jardine</italic> and HSBC founded <italic>British Chinese</italic> <italic>Corp</italic> to issue government debt and construct railroads. Still China expelled most Europeans aside from Japan grew in Manchuria, Korea, and Taiwan. \nAs Spanish Philippines was also attractive to Japan, America pounced. Like America\u2019s TA1890 tariff fostered trusts, it blocked sugar planters from Hawaii to Cuba. While Congress rejected annexation requests, a coaling port between California and Philippines became essential for war with Spain. So American looked towards the Kingdoms of Hawaii.\nAfter graduating <italic>Harvard </italic>Law<italic> </italic>in the 1840s, William Lee and his nephew-in-law, William Bishop of Upstate New York, moved West. (While not related to the Boston Brahmin, Lee\u2019s second cousin married was married to New York tobacco<italic> </italic>merchant <italic>Lorillard</italic>.) Arriving to Hawaii, Lee quickly rose through the judicial ranks, becoming a judge and eventually the inaugural Chief Justice, properly organizing Hawaiian judiciary with a head. While Lee also served as the president of the Land Commission, Bishop took a position at the American consulate to deal whaling contracts. By 1850, Bishop married Princess Bernice against the wishes of her father. Disowning Bernice, the King replaced her with Princess Liliuokalani. Although the Chinese were the first local sugar refiners, Lee shipped much sugar to the coast. He attempted to negotiate a treaty whereby America would buy Hawaiian sugar duty free in return for lumber and fish from America but died in 1857. \nWhile the government provided loans directly to planters and traders in the 1840s, they stopped around 1850 to focus on public improvements. A Californian bank briefly operated a branch in Honolulu in 1854 but closed. By 1859, Bishop formed<italic> Bishop</italic>, mostly to serve whalers., which remained Hawaii\u2019s only bank for decades. In 1871, Bishop hired Samuel Damon as clerk. Samuel was born in Honolulu to Reverend Samuel, the pioneer missionary who served as the chaplain of the <italic>Seamen\u2019s Institute</italic> from 1841 to 1882 and edited the Christian magazine <italic>Friend</italic>.\nBy 1875, a reciprocity treaty with America shifted Hawaii\u2019s primary industry and trade from whaling to sugar. As planters experienced financial stress in 1880, Hawaii made a loan to <italic>Bishop</italic>, which in turn, made loans to the planers. Within a year, <italic>Bishop </italic>made Samuel Damon a partner. But as interest rates increased in the wake of the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, sugar planters Claus Spreckels and William Irwin opened the second bank of <italic>Spreckels</italic>. While competition between banks lowered rates, Spreckels lobbied King Kalakaua and Premier Walter Murray Gibson to further his economic interests by seeking political favors and stability, opposing more radical ideas. \nFrom 1887, King Kalakaua appointed Samuel Damon Finance Minister for three terms, during which he financed the construction of <italic>Oahu</italic> RR. However, as TA1890 blocked American imports and nullified Hawaii\u2019s 1875 reciprocity treaty. As Kalakaua died in 1891, his sister Liliuokalani became Queen. While she had the support of Spreckels, Damon advised her to yield to a constitutional government as Americans and merchants revolted in 1893. By 1895, Damon acquired full ownership of <italic>Bishop</italic>, which grew rapidly and remained dominant even as competing banks entered.\nIn early 1898, the American battleship <italic>Maine</italic> blew up in Havana harbor. A staunch supporter of Cuban independence, silver magnate William Hearst swiftly printed two weeks\u2019 worth of deceptive material blaming Spain for the attack in his newspapers. This orchestrated coverage, not unique to Hearst, significantly boosted the paper\u2019s readership and played a role in the declaration of war.  As the <italic>Spanish-American War </italic>broke out, <italic>American China Development </italic>set her eyes on the Philippines. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic>, King Leo combined Congo funds with loans from <italic>Morgan</italic> to illicitly buy most of <italic>American China Development</italic>. Winning the <italic>Spanish-American War</italic> enabled <italic>OIL</italic>, <italic>Citi </italic>NB, <italic>Lehman</italic>, and other American banks financed consolidation of Cuban and Philippine sugar, alcohol, tobacco, and abaca for cordage, deflating commodity prices. \nAmidst the Philippines\u2019 revolt against Spain, some Basque families fled to Cebu and Malitbog before returned in 1901. Despite the American regime, the Basque <italic>Luzuriaga</italic> became one of the world\u2019s biggest sugar companies and <italic>Aboitiz</italic> diversified into copra and shipping. Under American law, the Philippines denied citizenship and economic assimilation to new Chinese immigrants, transitioning the Chinese from being an integral part of Philippine society to a marginalized alien group. Despite American Chinese exclusion laws, the enforcement was lax, allowing the Chinese population to steadily grow through immigration. Since Brussels banker <italic>Philippson Horowitz</italic>\u2019s Franz Philippson became an administrator of the Belgian Congo railways in 1889, his daughter married a Goldschmidt in 1901.At Leo\u2019s order, <italic>Rothchild</italic>-affiliated SG <italic>Belge</italic> formed <italic>Sino-Belgian Bank</italic> to develop business flows between Belgium and China by 1902. \nWhile HSBC competed with other European banks in Asia, America\u2019s NBA prohibited NBs from branching internationally. Because of the <italic>Spanish-American War</italic>, <italic>International Banking Corp</italic> of New York (\u201cIBC\u201d) became the first American NB to branch overseas with only overseas branches from 1901. After London in 1902, IBC branched to Shanghai, Singapore, Manila, Yokohama, and Hong Kong. Seeking to enter Panama, IBC retained<italic> Teixeira</italic> cousin Max Teixeira\u2014who had established <italic>Citi\u2019</italic>s FX department on <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>\u2019s recommendation and then did the same for <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Pittsburgh</italic>\u2014for advice before partnering with Jewish trader Henry Ehrman. Long a part of Colombia, Ehrman moved there from Louisiana in 1865. By the 1870s, he represented <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> and became the main trader with America.\nAs <italic>Panama Canal</italic> resumed construction, another extension in 1893 set the completion date for 1904. While Ehrman\u2019s son married the daughter of Colombian railroad director Manuel Amador, delays resulted in a third extension for a decade in 1900. As revolutions started and Colombian gunboats fired shells, Amador informed Henry\u2019s brother, American Vice Consul Felix Ehrman, who cabled Washington about Panama\u2019s impending independence declaration. With support from new President Theodore Roosevelt, Amador became Panama\u2019s first President in 1904, <italic>Banco Nacional</italic> and IBC became Panama\u2019s first banks, soon followed by <italic>Chase</italic> NB and other banks. After the <italic>Spanish-American War</italic>, <italic>Seligman</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic> again helped finance <italic>Panama Canal </italic>and payments to France. (<italic>Sullivan</italic> assisted in liquidating the old <italic>Lesseps</italic> company.)\nWhile Henry Ehrman\u2019s relatives in California linked him to <italic>Wells Fargo</italic>, they soon linked with larger bankers. Since Lehman and Seligman in-law Isaiah Hellman established Los Angeles\u2019 first bank, <italic>Farmers & Merchants Bank</italic>, he relocated to San Francisco to take over Mackay\u2019s financially troubled <italic>Bank of Nevada of San Francisco</italic> by 1890 with <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Levi Strauss</italic> investment. \nHellman soon partnered with lawyer Emanuel Heller, who became his son-in-law. By 1904, another of Hellman\u2019s daughters married lawyer Sidney Ehrman, who joined <italic>Heller</italic> <italic>Ehrman</italic> law firm. As Hellman merged <italic>Nevada Bank</italic> with <italic>Wells Fargo </italic>in 1905, he continued working with <italic>Heller</italic> <italic>Ehrman</italic>. A graduate of UCLA and the <italic>Hastings College of Law</italic>, Heller\u2019s father descended from the last Bavarian regional rabbi and immigrated to America in 1850s.\nAs with the Congo, Germany sought to cartelize Britain\u2019s coal trade monopoly. With <italic>Spanish-American War</italic> in 1898, Germany\u2019s Kaiser spurred GGE, <italic>Siemens</italic>, and <italic>Deutsche</italic> into Latin America. Most of the investments were banks and electric utilities. While <italic>Berliner </italic>founded Zurich-based <italic>Bank f\u00fcr Elektrische</italic> PUHC in 1897 to invest in electric ventures, French industrialists <italic>Schneider</italic> and <italic>Wendel</italic> and bankers <italic>Demachy Seilli\u00e8re</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> established <italic>Vishera Mining & Metallurgical Co</italic> to operate steelworks in the Urals and along the Volga River in 1897. \nThe same year, <italic>Hentsch</italic>\u2019s Ernest Hentsch\u2014head of<italic> Union Financi\u00e8re</italic> and brother of former <italic>Comptoir</italic> banker \u00c9douard Hentsch\u2014founded <italic>Electrique</italic> PUHC in Geneva to consolidate PUs with investment from <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Suisse</italic>, <italic>Lombard</italic> <italic>Odier</italic>, <italic>Pictet</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Commerciale</italic>. <italic>Schneider</italic> intended to supply the PUs with equipment like GE and SGE. Auguste Boissonnas, a director-founder, managed the company starting in 1898. In 1902, <italic>Electrique</italic> helped create <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re Italo-Suisse</italic> to finance Italian PUs. <italic>Electrique</italic> PUHC was smaller compared to Swiss institutions like <italic>Elektrobank</italic> and <italic>Indelec</italic> and was part of a network involving Swiss banks and foreign industrial groups.  \nIn a trade transformation that parallels <italic>Panama Canal</italic>, disruption ripples through Asia. Since the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> reduced the caravan trade to Baghdad and Persia, Syrian Sephardi moved to Egypt. Likewise, the development of the tourist industry fostered the activities of the moneychangers. The most prominent Sephardi already had ties with Egypt. After farmed revenues, Jacob Cattaui, was appointed chief Egyptian moneychanger late in the reign of Khedive Said (1854-63). \nBy 1849, Cattaui\u2019s daughter married the son of Jacob Menasce. A moneychanger of Cairo\u2019s Jewish quarter, Menasce fell out of pleasure with Pasha Muhammad Ali in 1848 and Menasce fled to Austria. After returning, Menasce established a merchant bank with branches in Manchester, Liverpool, Marseilles, Paris, and Constantinople. With backing from Khedive Ismail Yaqub, Menasce founded <italic>Turco-Egyptian Bank</italic> in 1870, and in 1875, was granted citizenship and an Austria barony. \nAs other families formed matrimonial alliances with French nationals of France, Menasce and Rolo intermarried with one another and British nationals. By 1870, the Rolo brothers formed <italic>Rolo</italic>. After Felix Suares married Henrietta Cattaui in 1874,<italic> Cattaui</italic> started as a bank in 1875 and the Suar\u00e9s brothers and Simon Rolo established <italic>Suar\u00e9s</italic>, all of whom closely cooperated to mediate European capital. Since marry-partnering with Cattaui<italic> </italic>in 1868, the Mosseri family, which had Italian origins, created the family bank after their father died in 1876. Also that year, the Greek Catholic Antoine Chiha and his father-in-law Raphael Faroun parlayed their silk profits to create <italic>Faroun </italic><italic>Chiha</italic> bank in Lebanon.\nSince <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier-</italic>allied <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> made a short-term loan to Egyptian Pasha Ismael in 1875, the Pasha defaulted in 1876, nearly wiping out<italic> Anglo-Egyptian</italic>. For a time, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna agent Julius Blum became Pasha until the Ottoman Sultan installed a son of the former pasha. While <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> recovered as the British reorganized Egyptian finances, Pasha Arabi\u2019s revolted in 1882 led Anglo-French forces to occupy Egypt. \nSoon after,<italic> Alexandria Stock Exchange</italic> started in the cotton port, but operations did not commence until 1888 and remained insignificant then. Meanwhile, Raphael Suar\u00e9s founded <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier Egyptien</italic> with French capital by 1880, which became a major credit provider for Egypt\u2019s landowners. While Evelyn Baring was named Consul-General of Egypt in 1883, <italic>Berliner </italic>funded the acquisition of Egypt\u2019s railroad system in 1889. \nFor India, Britain devolved administration from 1872, allowing banking families to ally with factional groups across municipal boards across all North-Western cities. In Delhi <italic>Chunna Saligram</italic> had several family members and other connections on a board of under a dozen members in the 1870s. In Benares, members of the Naupati bankers, prominent since the days of the Rajas, inter-married to influence municipalities. \nThis mercantile and banker caste with strong urban interests became involved in Hindu nationalism. During the Congressional sessions between 1885 and 1901, Brahmin were delegated 551 times, Kayasths 294 times, and members of mercantile castes like Chettiar, Agarwal, and others at least 404 times, with over half classified as bankers or traders. As Britain ended the Hindu venture bans in 1899, Parsee Tata industrialized India with steel and hydroelectricity. \nIndians also worked at British banks. Serving as government banker for British East Africa and Uganda, <italic>National Bank of India</italic> branched to Zanzibar in 1893, Nairobi in 1904, and Entebbe in 1906, and Kampala afterward. In Nairobi, <italic>National Bank of India</italic> employed four Europeans and twelve Indians around 1908 and corresponded with <italic>National Provincial</italic>, <italic>National Bank of Scotland</italic>, <italic>British Linen Co</italic>, and <italic>Provincial Bank of Ireland</italic> to handle drafts and remittances for the bank.\nEuropean bankers interconnected Indian Presidency banks and agencies. Montague Turner, a partner at <italic>Mackinnon Mackenzie</italic>, served as Chair of <italic>Chartered Bank of India, Australia, & China </italic>(\u201c<italic>Chartered</italic>\u201d). <italic>Indian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>\u2019s board included <italic>Hoare Miller</italic>, and <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> partners. Since the late 1870s, <italic>Jardine</italic> Calcutta and <italic>Jardine</italic> Hong Kong added directors to <italic>Chartered</italic>. While Herbert Smyth represented the family at <italic>Jardine</italic>,<italic> </italic>William Mackenzie joined <italic>Smyth</italic> cousins, London stockbroker <italic>Zoete</italic> in 1896.\nWith Smyth kinterlinked with West African palm oil trader <italic>Horsfall</italic> in 1891, <italic>Smyth</italic> was long connected to <italic>Barclay Bevan</italic>. Around 1900, a Smyth heiress married a cousin of the Finlay, Campbell, Coutts, and Bevan.<italic> </italic>While <italic>Finlay</italic> merged with <italic>Baring</italic> in the 1860s, the Campbells kinterlinked with the Finlays, founded <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> Bombay, and served on <italic>Indian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>\u2019s board. Since Colin Middleton Campbell kinterlinked with Bevan in 1873\u2014and their son was BOE\u2019s Deputy Governor from 1905 and Governor from 1907. \nHis cousin Colin Hogg Campbell\u2014whose mother was the daughter of Guyana<italic> </italic>tea merchant <italic>Hogg</italic>\u2014married a daughter of <italic>Coutts</italic>\u2019 Senior Partner in 1890. After his father died in 1897, Colin succeeded him as Governor of <italic>London Assurance</italic>. He succeeded John Muir as Chair of <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> following his death in 1903, and merged with Charles Perkins Forbes\u2019 firm. Joining <italic>National Provincial</italic>\u2019s board, he invested in Indian textiles and sugar.\nLondon and Manchester merchant Emile Levita was one of the few Jews to crack this clique and become a director of <italic>Chartered </italic>in 1872 for 37 years. A grandson of the former Chief Rabbi of Westphalia and a Hanover banker, Levita immigrated to Britain in the 1850s and wed a Manchester-born daughter of the Danish R\u00e9e family, a cousin of Oppenheim and Warburg families. By the late 1870s, <italic>Jardine</italic> Calcutta and <italic>Jardine</italic> Hong Kong added directors to <italic>Chartered</italic>.\nSo did some ethnic Chinese. Lim Cheak was born in Penang to a moderately wealthy Chinese merchant family. He began his career as a clerk in a mercantile office in Penang, later opened a general store, and partnered with a Chinese merchant in Sumatra. By the 1880s, he had become a ship-owner, planter, and proprietor of three rice mills in Penang. Along with acting as an adviser to a regional sultan, he joined a banking deputation that included a <italic>Chartered </italic>representative, serving as the only non-European, in 1889. \nLim married seven wives distributed between Kedah, Penang, Ipoh, southern Siam, and Kuala Lumpur, likely connected to his business operations. His chief wife, of Thai noble descent and likely a daughter of a local chieftain, was active as a planter and miner in Kedah. In 1894, his daughter Lim Kwee Sean married Goh Boon Keng, who had worked at <italic>Mercantile Bank</italic> before joining <italic>Cheak</italic> as business partner.\nFrom Singapore, British banks expanded into the Malay States to fund rubber. HSBC opened a branch in Penang in 1884, while <italic>Chartered </italic>branched to Taiping and Kuala Lumpur in 1888. Indian minorities benefited from links to international finance and liberalization. From the late 1880s, Chettiars expanded to Singapore, Malaya, and Burma to develop tin, rubber, and rice, channeling British funds into high-interest micro loans collateralized by plantations and mines. \nWhile Parsee and other Indians sometimes formed a majority of<italic> Bank of Bombay</italic> directors, India\u2019s other Presidency banks, <italic>Bank of Madras</italic> and <italic>Bank of Bengal</italic> consistently lacked Indian directors since the 1870s. Likewise, Europeans monopolized the foreign trade in Bengal and Madras. Notable joint-stock banks such as <italic>Mercantile Bank</italic>, <italic>Alliance Bank of Simla</italic>, and <italic>Allahabad Bank</italic> were also under European control, although Indians had organized the latter. \nBy the early 1900s, <italic>Arbuthnot</italic>, led by George Arbuthnot, operated <italic>Gillanders Arbuthnot</italic> in Calcutta, and partnerships in Bombay and Britain. He appointed <italic>Macfayden</italic> as the firm\u2019s sole London correspondent with authority to transact in its name. However, <italic>Macfayden</italic> incurred losses in American railroads, South African goldfields, and West Indian commodities, while Arbuthnot diverted deposits to personal accounts and gold ventures in the Nilgiri-Wynaad. After Macfayden committed suicide in London on October 20, 1906, both firms declared bankruptcy. Arbuthnot was convicted of cheating and embezzlement and sentenced to imprisonment.\nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1906</italic> in Madras, <italic>Binny</italic> faced liquidity issues and was acquired by James Mackay<italic> </italic>while <italic>Parry</italic> secured a London loan to meet liabilities. As the newspaper <italic>Hindu</italic> exposed the fraud, Indian-controlled financial institutions rose. Within a month, Indian leaders including the Tamil merchant brothers Annamalai and Dewan Chettiar, lawyer Krishnaswamy Iyer, Muslim merchant Mohamed Saheb, founded <italic>Indian Bank</italic>, as the first indigenous joint-stock bank in Madras, with as founders. As <italic>Bank of Baroda</italic> and <italic>Punjab </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Sind Bank</italic> followed in 1908, <italic>Bank of Madras</italic> and<italic> Bank of Bengal</italic> appointed Indian directors. \nAs the Ottomans occupied Yemen and imposed modernizing Tanzimat reforms, <italic>Suez</italic> and <italic>ORIENT</italic> impacted trade routes and regional power dynamics. The decline of Hadhrami Arab shippers began in the 1880s with the rise of steam navigation, posing a significant challenge to their traditional sail shipping dominance in the Indian Ocean. Soon after, European Jews resettled persecuted co-religionists from Yemen to Syrian Palestine.\nLikewise, since the failure of Greek bankers in 1881 and the subsequent Ottoman financial reforms, Turkish finance remained controlled by Christian Greeks and Armenians. But they had lost power with the rise of <italic>TURK</italic>. Employing a few Jews and no Muslims\u2014beyond interpreters or subordinate roles\u2014<italic>TURK</italic><italic> </italic>began appointing local Christians to senior management around the 1880s. By 1891 four Ottoman branches and Sofia had Ottoman managers, Usak had a Greek manager, and seven others, including Izmir and Beirut, had Ottomans in the second rank. In 1902 nine of 25 branches had Ottoman managers, two including Istanbul had Ottoman-born Greeks, one had a Levantine, and thirteen were Europeans mostly Mediterranean-born. \nWhile <italic>TURK</italic> had the heft to renegotiate debt with <italic>Rothschild</italic> (through <italic>Lambert</italic>) in 1891, her<italic> </italic>monopoly continued not to encompass land. Since civil servant Pasha Midhat created <italic>Credit Funds</italic> in 1863 with the support of reformist Tanzimat bureaucrats, <italic>Credit Funds</italic> were supplied by a surtax on the tithe, supporting public works at the provincial level from 1883. By 1888, the funds consolidated into <italic>Agricultural Bank</italic> to provide low-interest loans to cultivators. Despite this, local elites ran the provincial branches, disadvantaging smaller cultivators, and state officials siphoned off profits.\nWhile not tolerating a European style aristocracy, the Ottomans integrated mostly Muslim regional leaders into governance following the Tanzimat reforms. For example, families were active in administration of the Black Sea port of Trabzon. Mehmed Nemlizade served as a kadi in the 1860s, and his son led regional trade and lent cash to farmers and other merchants with interest. Pasha Suba\u015f\u0131zade Pertev served in the Vilayet Council, chaired the Public Works Commission, and was part of the Board of Allegation in 1904. Pertev\u2019s daughter married an influential figure in Trabzon\u2019s government, and another descendant allied with Pasha Haznedarzade Osman, serving as treasurer to the K\u0131\u011f\u0131 lord. By 1904, non-Muslims held 20% of Trabzon\u2019s official roles, up from 12.5% in 1888. Christian figures like Andon Efendi, a municipal council member, and Kalpakcidi Yorgi, who oversaw customs, played key roles in the city\u2019s governance.\nMirroring Russian antisemitism, Ottoman anti-Armenian sentiment burst out in pogroms. In 1894, the Hamidiyeh regiments, primarily Kurdish cavalry, attacked Sasun in Bitlis Province, destroying 25 villages and killing 20,000 Armenians. By 1895, massacres spread to Constantinople, where 10,000 Armenians were killed, sparking similar violence across Anatolia. In 1896, Armenian nationalists seized <italic>TURK</italic>, leading to harsh reprisals. By then, over 200,000 Armenians had been killed, with more than 500,000 displaced and stripped of their possessions. \nStill, after years of Tanzimat reforms, most of Constantinople brokers and bankers were Christian Greeks and Armenians, with several Jews, and no Muslims. As Greek Catholic families fled Lebanon, some arrived in Nigeria to lead trade, while another, Helu, soon dominated commerce in Mexico, and still others fled across Latin America. Likewise, the genocides challenged Armenian dominance over Egyptian trade, the aristocratic Sarofim and other Christian Copt landowning families increasing their influence since the 1870s with financing from European Jews.\nWhen <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna integrated the <italic>Mobilier</italic> affiliated <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Boden</italic><italic>c</italic><italic>redit </italic>into their group in 1886, <italic>Deutsche Bank </italic>and<italic> Lyonnais </italic>invested in<italic> \u00d6sterreichische</italic>\u2019s<italic> Wiener</italic>. With <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR<italic> </italic>complete in 1888, Maurice Hirsch sold <italic>ORIENT </italic>to a syndicate formed by Austrian <italic>Wiener</italic>, Swiss <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>, and German <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> (and later <italic>Dresdner</italic>) to extend <italic>ORIENT</italic> from Constantinople into Anatolia. Leading the transaction were <italic>Deutsche</italic> Chair and <italic>Wiener</italic> Director Werner Siemens and Hirsch\u2019s cousin of <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic>\u2019s Alfred Kaulla, a descendant of Lion Halphen Goudchaux and a grand nephew of <italic>W\u00fcrttemberg Court Bank</italic>\u2019s Chaile. Kaulla received a concession for the railway to Ankara. \nAt the same time as buying <italic>ORIENT</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic> invested in <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>\u2014affiliated with <italic>Rothschild </italic>Vienna\u2014and formed <italic>Hungarian Industrial </italic><italic>Bank </italic>with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Anversois</italic>, <italic>Commerce et L\u2019Industrie</italic>, <italic>Wiener</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris as shareholders, Count Julius Andrassy and <italic>Dresdner</italic>\u2019s Eugene Guttman as board directors, and Count Imre Karolyi as President.<italic> </italic>Although the prospective oil fields in Mosul and Baghdad provinces had been a subsidiary of the Baghdad railway expansion, Sultan Abdul Hamid II Ottoman instructed his personal banker, Hagop Zarifi, to incorporate the properties into the Privy Purse. While the Sultan granted a permit to his Chief of Staff Tahsin Pasha, it lapsed before turning into a concession.\nBy 1895, Romania suffered a famine. While<italic> Deutsche</italic> withheld funds until Romania allowed oil exports, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, alongside<italic> Marmorosch</italic>, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, and <italic>Berliner</italic> subscribed to a public loan in Bucharest with a reduced interest rate for urban modernization projects. By 1897, <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> reorganized <italic>Elias</italic> of Bucharest into the commercial bank <italic>Romanian General </italic>to boost Germano-Romanian trade relations. Since Christian Emil Costinescu transitioned from Chief Editor of <italic>Rom\u00e2nul</italic>, to politician, and became the first President of <italic>Romanian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>in 1880\u2014which had started in 1865 as <italic>TURK</italic>\u2019s branch <italic>Romania Bank</italic> with funds from <italic>Halfon</italic>,<italic> Marmorosch</italic>\u2019s in-law Isaak L\u00f6bel, Adolf Hertz, and Prince Ion Ghica\u2014he took over as the first General Director of <italic>Romanian General</italic>.\nAnd as <italic>Lower Austrian Discount </italic><italic>Bank</italic> of Vienna invested in <italic>First Pest Savings Bank </italic>that year, Hungarian banks grew closer to Austria since <italic>Wiener</italic> affiliated<italic> Hungarian Industrial </italic><italic>Bank </italic>pioneered the globalization of Romanian oil production, branching <italic> </italic>to Budapest in 1890 and later acquiring a Romanian petroleum company. In 1895, <italic>Wiener </italic>established <italic>Mortgage</italic><italic> Bank for Bosnia </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Herzegovina </italic>in Sarajevo, absorbing <italic>Credit Bureau</italic> and <italic>Bosnia Savings Bank</italic> and branching to Mostar, Tuzla, Br\u010dko, Bjeljina, and Banja Luka. The bank dominated wholesale tobacco and restricted its activities to Bosnia.\nBy 1896, <italic>ORIENT</italic> RR inked to Ankara and Konya. To extended <italic>ORIENT</italic> to Baghdad, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, and <italic>TURK</italic> established <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Orient</italic>. As<italic> TURK</italic> bought a fifty-year concession to Turkey\u2019s Heraclea coal deposits to lead local development in 1896, she funded a railroads and mines along the Zambezi River in Portuguese Mozambique. However, after speculating with Turkish and South-African securities, <italic>TURK</italic> suffered great losses since 1895, and liquidated by 1899. \nFrom the 1880s, <italic>TURK</italic> sought to expand beyond the Ottoman Empire. While Ottoman-Greek relations over Crete made Greek expansion politically sensitive, Bulgaria was governed by a pro-Turkish regime. With a branch at Plovdiv, she opened one in Sofia in 1890 and Ruse in 1892. In 1890, <italic>TURK</italic> and Austrian and German banks advanced to <italic>Bulgarian National Bank</italic> and joined a loan issued in 1892.\nSince the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, all attempts to establish banks with foreign capital failed. The agricultural economy\u2019s dominant banks for the next two decades would be the state-owned <italic>Bulgarian National Bank</italic> from 1879. Several private joint-stock saving bank companies were established, the most successful of which was <italic>Girdap Bank</italic> in the Danube city of Ruse in 1881. <italic>Girdap</italic>\u2019s shareholders enjoyed significant control, including audit rights and mandatory meeting attendance, aligning politically with the liberal party.\nIn rural central northern Bulgaria, meanwhile, Bulgarian Orthodox Dimitar Burov became the last surviving founding brother of merchant bank <italic>Burov</italic>. By the early 1890s he integrated his brothers\u2019 heirs into <italic>Burov</italic>\u2019s management, who expanded in the Danube town of Svishtov in 1895. As credit companies and small banks spread across Bulgaria, <italic>Commercial & Industrial Bank</italic> became the first joint-stock bank in Plovdiv. Likewise, <italic>Bulgarian Lottery Bank</italic> became the first foreign company to incorporate in Bulgaria, with investment from <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2019s <italic>Bank of Salonica</italic>, <italic>Norddeutsche Bank </italic>of Hamburg, and other German companies. \nBy the turn of the century, Burov and his brother-in-law Gubidelnikov founded <italic>Targovska Banka</italic> of Sofia, which became the country\u2019s most powerful private bank with investment from <italic>Wiener </italic>and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>. <italic>Targovska</italic> engaged in friendly competition with the liberal <italic>Girdap</italic> for a duopoly in banking and politics. Likewise, <italic>Parbias</italic> and <italic>Wiener</italic> participated in the Bulgarian loan negotiation, secured by the tobacco monopoly. <italic>Wiener </italic>also collaborated in Serbian government loans.\nAs Consul-General Baring sought to channel British capital into Egypt, Ernest Cassel, Raphael Suar\u00e9s, and <italic>Sassoon</italic> established <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic> in 1898. The same year, Cassel and Suar\u00e9s privatized vast feudal lands that Pasha Ismael had pledged to <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> for the loan of 1870 that was defaulted on in 1878. After Suar\u00e9s\u2019 French Catholic stepdaughter married the Khedive\u2019s cousin in 1901, Suar\u00e9s and Cassel executed Baring\u2019s initiative with <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s Carl Meyer to complete the first <italic>Aswan Dam</italic> in 1902 Suar\u00e9s and his in-laws also founded <italic>Sugar of Egypt</italic> with French capital in the 1890s, soon operating several factories, and expanded into industry. \nWhile the Ottoman Sultan\u2019s Iraqi oil concession lapsed, the Levantine Christian Crispin-in-law Malhame controlled Ottoman finances out of Beirut. Back in 1894, Salim Malhame held shares in <italic>Beirut-Damascus</italic> RR and <italic>Beirut Port</italic>, both completed that year. Since Salim Malhame became Director General in the Ottoman Ministry of Mines, Forests, & Agriculture, he negotiated concessions in the 1880s, some of which he granted to his brothers, such one to Najib for drinking-water distribution in Beirut in 1901. When Habib Malhame joined with William d\u2019Arcy to develop Iraqi oil fields in 1901 as d\u2019Arcy\u2019s <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> gained an oil concession in 1901, Cassel and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris did not<italic> </italic>supply enough funds. So, <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> merged with <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Samuel</italic>, and <italic>Smyth</italic> financed <italic>Shell</italic> to keep American <italic>OIL</italic> out of Indonesia and Burma in 1901.\nCompetition was  fierce in oil rich Romania. Although not much is known about the lineages of<italic> </italic>Romanian Jewish oil banker Jacob Marmorosch of Bucharest, his brother-in-law Abraham L\u00f6bel had banked in Vienna and kinterlinked with a Katz-Bondi descendent cousin of Wertheim, Goldschmidt, and Porges in the 1870s. After Abraham L\u00f6bel\u2019s son died in 1883, a granddaughter of L\u00f6bel and Marmorosch wed a Viennese Ulmann, of a likely but unknown relation to the Ulmans, in 1884. By 1890, the nephew of Marmorosch\u2019s son-in-law married a cousin-in-law of <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>\u2019s Kornfeld and <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter </italic>and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> invested in <italic>Marmorosch </italic>in 1890. \nDuring the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, <italic>L\u00f6bel</italic>\u2014taken over by Marmorosch\u2019s cousin Leon L\u00f6bel\u2014suspended payment and failed in Romania due to investments in the Dostana sawmill and private bonds. As investigations revealed earlier signs of insolvency overlooked with proper scrutiny, a Vienna-born Marmorosch married a L\u00f6bel cousin. \n<italic>Marmorosch </italic>continued to dominate investment banking in the Balkans, including ventures in the oil, wood, and food industries, notably establishing Braila\u2019s cement plant in 1889, <italic>Dorohoi-Iasi</italic> RR and <italic>Ramnicu Valcea-Ca\u0302ineni</italic> RR by 1895, and <italic>Bank of Commerce</italic> in Craiova in 1898. After converting into a joint-stock company in 1904, <italic>Marmorosch </italic>intensified activities, establishing subsidiaries such as <italic>Bank of Commerce & Warehouses</italic> in Romanian Bucharest and Turkish Salonica, <italic>Bank of Moldova</italic>, and <italic>Schapira</italic> in Ploiesti.\nOf unknown relation, Solomon Ulmann married Hanna Bache, Katz-cousin and direct descendant of Samson Wertheim and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister. Hanna\u2019s sister-in-law married a Frankfurt Oppenheim descended from Katz through Gunzburg. Years after Ulmann immigrated to America in 1836, he partnered with Hanna\u2019s brother, Semon Bache, to import and deal glass. Of the famed Jewish glass makers of F\u00fcrth, Bavaria, Bache was related to the oldest, Gosdorf, through Wertheim. \nA cousin of the Gosdorfs, Leo Ulmann of F\u00fcrth married Agnes Bache, Semon Bache\u2019s sister-in-law wed Leo Cahn. A daughter of the latter married Adolph Lewisohn in 1878 as his sister wed a Katz-descendant,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Lewisohn</italic> started shipping copper from Montana east to New York and Boston from 1879. After Cahn started a brokerage in 1879, Bache\u2019s son joined, later renaming it <italic>Bache</italic>. When glass importers pooled into <italic>GLASS</italic> in 1890, they elected Bache as president.\nIn 1885, Ulmann\u2019s daughter married Ferdinand Blumenthal of Frankfurt. While little is known about his father, Ferdinand\u2019s mother descended from Michael Speyer. This <italic>Speyer</italic> connection ties Ferdinand to Frankfurt-born George Blumenthal, whose lineage is also lost. After a decade with <italic>Speyer</italic> New York, George resigned as partner in 1893 to kinterlink with <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Marc Meyer, becoming Senior Partner in 1904. \nIn 1891, Ulmann\u2019s youngest daughter Blanche married Siegfried Wertheim, a Hessen of unclear background who imported paper stock and sulphite pulp. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, Wertheim absconded in a commercial failure. By 1901, Solomon Ulmann\u2019s son, Julien, a NYSE member and leather merchant, married Gertrude Barclay, an affiliate of <italic>Vanderbilt</italic> and extended cousin of <italic>Astor</italic> and <italic>Roosevelt</italic><italic>.</italic>\nBy 1904, <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s expansion in Galician Boryslaw crashed European prices from overproduction. While Hirsch-affiliated<italic> Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Austrian </italic><italic>Bank</italic> and the Offenheim and Biedermann families reorganized Anglo-Austrian oil investments, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> restructured the oil-focused <italic>Galician Bank for Trade </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Industry</italic>. \nLikewise, <italic>OIL</italic> had invested in Romania, alongside French <italic>Desmarais</italic> and others, German banks increased investment. Since <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der </italic>reorganized <italic>Elias</italic> of Bucharest into <italic>Romanian</italic> <italic>General </italic>to boost Germano-Romanian trade in 1897, oil investment grew after the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic>. After initiating involvement in Romanian and Galician oil ventures in 1903, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> allied against <italic>OIL</italic> with <italic>Shell</italic> and formed <italic>Deutsche </italic>Petroleum<italic> </italic>in 1904 as a HC for firms in Galicia (<italic>Schodnica</italic>), Romania (<italic>Star</italic>), and Russia (<italic>Kasbek</italic>). \nWhile competing with <italic>Deutsche </italic>in Constantinople,<italic> Wiener</italic> invested in <italic>Deutsche </italic>Petroleum. <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der </italic>acquired the British <italic>Bustenarii</italic> and French <italic>Telega</italic> to form <italic>Concordia</italic>. That year, <italic>Jeschek</italic>\u2014affiliated with the Lieben family\u2014and <italic>Vienna</italic> <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> formed <italic>Romanian Credit</italic> as a joint-stock company with a board including members of the Conservative Party. Likewise, <italic>Lower Austrian</italic><italic> Discount</italic> formed joint stock bank <italic>Dickin</italic>. By 1905, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, <italic>Bohrgesellschaft</italic>,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Parisienne</italic> established <italic>Regatul Romana</italic>.\nMeanwhile, James Stillman\u2014whose father helped develop Texas from 1837\u2014joined <italic>Citi</italic> NB\u2019s board in 1884, added William Rockefeller, and they took charge of the bank in 1891 upon the resignation of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s President. By 1899, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Schiff joined <italic>Citi\u2019</italic>s board. Since <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> secured financing from <italic>Boissevain</italic>, both of which were affiliated with <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> in 1893, <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> hired Henri Deterding, formerly of <italic>Twentsche</italic> and <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>. \nShortly after, <italic>Boissevain</italic> kinterlinked with <italic>Twentsche</italic>. In 1904, Maria\u2019s second cousin, Dutch diplomat Jan Roijen, married Alberina Taylor Winthrop, whose grandfather was deceased <italic>Citi</italic> President Moses Taylor and father was Robert Winthrop\u2014a former <italic>Drexel</italic> partner\u2014whose cousin had married a Perry sister-in-law of August Belmont. The Belmonts also connected to the Taylors through the Howlands since 1889.  \nAs France abolished tariffs in 1904, SG <italic>Belge </italic>reorganized <italic>Parisienne </italic>with investment from the Huguenot<italic> Mallet</italic>, <italic>Mirabaud</italic>, <italic>Neuflize</italic>, and <italic>Vernes</italic> with <italic>Heine</italic>.<italic> </italic>Under leadership of SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic> soon rivaled <italic>Paribas</italic> and became the French investment bank of choice for <italic>Schneider</italic> and <italic>Shell</italic>. <italic>Parisienne</italic> then set out on a strategy that eventually made it branch to 34 cities across the Ottoman Empire, Greece, Ukraine, and Egypt and control most of the leading Balkan banks within a decade. \n<italic>Parisienne </italic>invested in <italic>Bank of Athens</italic>, which Rodocanachi, Ralli, Baltazzi, Mavrogordatos, and the Chiot diaspora shipping banker cousin-in-laws started in 1893, where L\u00e9on Zarifi of Marseille became a director. Greek shippers grew close to French bankers as they had in Britain, when <italic>London Joint Stock Bank</italic> acquired <italic>Imperial Bank</italic>, with investors including <italic>Ralli</italic>, <italic>Rodocanachi</italic><italic>,</italic> <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic><italic> Goldschmidt</italic>, and <italic>Stern</italic><italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>By1902, a cousin of the Mavrogordatos and Baltazzi families married a French Wendel.\nSince then, Greece cemented diplomatic relations with Germany and Russia. The children of Greek King George and his Romanov wife married Sophia of Prussia in 1889, two Romanov cousins in 1900 and 1902, and British Queen Victoria\u2019s granddaughter Alice of Battenberg in 1903. Not until late 1907 did another of Greek King George\u2019s sons married Marie Bonaparte of France.\nCompeting with <italic>Bank of Athens</italic>, German and British founded kinterlinked Greek banks. Representing German interests, <italic>Nationalbank</italic> partnered with <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>to establish <italic>Banque d\u2019Orient</italic> in Athens in 1904. Within a year, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, and <italic>Nationalbank</italic> founded <italic>Orientbank</italic>, which took over <italic>d\u2019Orient</italic>\u2019s branches in Hamburg and Constantinople and branched to Cairo, Alexandria, Brussa, Kalamata, Constantinople, Salonica, Izmir, Tangier, and Casablanca. As <italic>Nationalbank</italic> formed a community of interest with <italic>Pal\u00e4stinabank</italic>, linking their operations in Haifa, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Beirut, and Hamburg in 1905, <italic>Dresdner </italic>allied with <italic>Morgan</italic>. \nA director of <italic>d\u2019Orient</italic>, Petro Camora, married a Mavrogordatos cousin-in-law of the Baltazzi and Sina families. On the <italic>d\u2019Orient</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Orientbank</italic> boards, Leonidas Zarifi of Constantinople represented Turkish interests and Georges Streit, of German heritage and a son of the Governor of <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, represented Greek interests. <italic>Orientbank</italic>\u2019s employees also provided international linkages. The Cairo branch, for example, was directed by Randolph Said Ruete\u2014the German national son of a deceased Hamburg merchant and the exiled sister of the Sultan of Zanzibar\u2014and Albert Erfield\u2014the Persian subject of Jewish-Polish origin who worked as an accountant at <italic>Ottoman</italic> <italic>Bank </italic>in Port Said. Salomon Meyer, a British Jew, was responsible for the securities department. The same year, Mavrogordatos cousins in Egypt founded <italic>Egyptian Land Bank</italic>.\nAnd for British interests, Gregory Embedocles, born in Constantinople and educated in London, founded <italic>Commercial Bank of Greece</italic> in 1905, later joined by his brother-in-law, Dimitrious Petrokokkinos, a Rodocanachi and Ralli cousin who was born and educated in London.\nTo distribute railway, electrification, and other public work deals in Morocco from 1902, <italic>Paribas</italic> organized a consortium with <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, soon adding <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Indochine</italic>. After France extended <italic>Bank of </italic>Algeria\u2019s issuance privilege into Tunisia in 1904, she did not enter Morocco as Cassel created a bank for the French. France aimed to secure control of Morocco in exchange for permitting Britain to take Egypt, while Germany pushed for free trade and an open-door policy. Although French banks were involved in the negotiations, they excluded <italic>Creuset</italic> from the discussions: \nAfter George Rosenberg Warburg married Lucie Goldschmidt Kaulla and George\u2019s sister Lilly married Lucie\u2019s cousin Otto Kaulla, they partnered with Cassel, <italic>Deutsche Bank,</italic> <italic>Wiener</italic>, <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic> and <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and <italic>Zafiropoulo Zarifi</italic> to extend <italic>ORIENT</italic> into oil-rich Iraq\u2014a <italic>Berlin-Baghdad</italic> RR\u2014in 1903. Faring for British India, Britain\u2019s new protectionist Minister dissuaded Cassel<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic><italic>Morgan</italic> from participating. As France sought to colonize Morocco, tensions escalated between France and Germany in the <italic>Tangier Crisis of 1905</italic> until European powers backed France in 1906. \nWhile <italic>Alexandria Stock Exchange</italic> commenced in 1888 with the arrival of the French to the cotton port, transactions remained insignificant. By 1903, Cattaui organized <italic>Cairo Stock Exchange</italic>, with representatives from <italic>Lyonnaise</italic>, <italic>TURK</italic>, <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic>, and <italic>Arbib</italic>. By 1905, <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic> received a concession to establish <italic>Bank of Abyssinia</italic>. While the founding committee included three Brits, three Italians, and a German, the bank primarily had British interests and personnel, despite efforts to internationalize the venture. \nBy 1905, <italic>Bank of German </italic><italic>East</italic><italic> Africa</italic>, with branches in Zanzibar, Mombasa, and Dar-es-Salaam. Driving out the British <italic>Indian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>and <italic>Chartered Bank</italic>, she served as both an ordinary and central note bank for German East Africa, facilitating payments and remittances, and was authorized to issue bank notes in <italic>rupees</italic>. \nForestalling the growth of <italic>Bank of British West Africa</italic>, <italic>Bank of German West Africa</italic> started that year, operating as colonial central banks in Togo and Cameroon but without a note issuance privilege. Major German banks such as <italic>Berliner</italic>, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, <italic>Disconto</italic>, <italic>Nationalbank</italic>, <italic>Norddeutsche</italic>, and <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>funded the colonization, including the construction of <italic>Cameroon</italic> RR to link Duala to the Manenguba Mountains in 1906. \nSince German authorities expelled Duala traders from the Sanaga for allegedly arming the Bakoko rebellion of 1895, weakening Akwa control and secured Bell dominance as the main local intermediaries, <italic>Cameroon</italic> RR and improved seaports in 1912, led the Akwa chiefs and Senior Chief Rudolf Bell to protest the seizure of property, relocation of residents, and weakened economic role. Likewise, Germany became Liberia\u2019s primary trade partner, with <italic>German </italic><italic>Liberia Bank </italic>and<italic> Bank of British West Africa</italic> as the country\u2019s two banks.\nMeanwhile, as Jacob Marmorosch died, Mauriciu Blanco took over <italic>Marmorosch</italic>, and promoted his son Astride. With investment from <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, <italic>Berliner</italic>, and <italic>Paribas</italic> invested in <italic>Marmorosch </italic>and took her public, doubling her capital and acquiring Galatz banker<italic> Dall</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Orso</italic>. After divorcing Siegfried Wertheim, Blanche Ulmann wed in 1906 Milenko Vesni\u0107, Serbia\u2019s future PM. Year later, after several marriages, Blanche\u2019s daughter married Astride Blanco, then head of <italic>Marmorosch</italic>. \nIn 1906, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Wiener</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Anversois</italic>, and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Li\u00e9geois</italic> formed Romanian\u2019s top bank,<italic> </italic><italic>Romanian Commercial Bank</italic>,<italic> </italic>by acquiring <italic>Belgian-Romanian Credit</italic> and partnering with Bucharest Jewish <italic>Halfon</italic> and Greek <italic>Chrissoveloni</italic> of Chios and <italic>Economos</italic> of Trieste.\nKinterlinked with <italic>Marmorosch</italic>, <italic>Hungarian Creditbank </italic>separated from <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> in 1905, and initiated talks with <italic>Belmont</italic>, <italic>Hallgarten</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Landenburg</italic> <italic>Thalmann</italic>, and <italic>Seligman</italic>, to establish a bank in America to handle remittances from Hungarian immigrants and promote trade. <italic>Hungarian-American Bank</italic> was chartered and planned to open in 1907, but delays caused by the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic> postponed the launch. \nFollowing the death of Zsigmond Kornfeld in 1909, Moritz Ulman\u2019s first cousin twice removed Adolf became President of <italic>Creditbank</italic>. After studying at the Commercial Academy, Adolf joined<italic> Creditbank</italic> in 1874. By 1881, he was promoted to Director, and in 1895, Managing Director. He founded 87 industrial enterprises and held leadership roles in over 25 financial and industrial companies. \nSince Adolf Ulman\u2019s sister married uncle-in-law of Catholic landowner Philipp Baumgarten, she connected her family with Bernhard Paper, a Jew who became Chair of <italic>Wiener</italic> from 1908. The Baumgartens also connected Ulmans to the Kaullas and Schossbergers, in-laws of the Deutsch family, who dominated Hungarian sugar and banking along with the Ulmans. \nBack in 1905, with <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s Samuel support, Britain defeated Russia for Persia. As Persia became Iran, <italic>Shell</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and <italic>Deutsche </italic>cartelized Eurasian oil to lock in <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> and lock out <italic>OIL</italic> and Russia by 1906. That year, <italic>Deutsche </italic>led <italic>European Petroleum Union</italic> to unite Russian, Austrian Galician, and Romanian cartelize oil producers and consolidate selling. <italic>Shell</italic> soon handled Persia\u2019s loan to join <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>\u2019s board. While John Bergheim of Galician oiler <italic>Bergheim MacGarvey</italic> gained a near-monopoly on petroleum exploration in Southern Nigeria, his search for oil failed.\nFunding Russia with <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1906, Europe\u2019s largest grain trader,<italic> Louis-</italic><italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic>, grew from managing almost a fifth of Russia\u2019s wheat exports in the late 1880s to a third in the early 1900s, Louis Louis-Dreyfu\u00df\u2014whose mother Emilie Aron Lang was a third cousin once removed of Esther Cerf Aron Lazard\u2014wed a Katz-descendant of ennobled Schey Rothschild-cousins d\u2019Worms and Baron Levi of Florence. Around the same time, Louis-Dreyfu\u00df started a Parisian bank.\nAs <italic>Shell</italic> and <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> merged, Robert, the grandson of Nathaniel Cohen-Barent and Jacob Waley\u2014cousins of Rothschild, Samuel, and Katz\u2014played a key role in the amalgamation, becoming a director in 1907 and later chair of the British entity, <italic>Anglo-Saxon Petroleum </italic>(\u201c<italic>Shell</italic> Britain\u201d). Since <italic>Shell</italic> remained a dually-owned company, with <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> owning 60%, and <italic>Rothchild</italic> London and <italic>Samuel </italic>being large investors in <italic>Shell</italic> Britain, Vivian and his cousin Abel Smyth soon linked the <italic>Shell</italic>, <italic>Samuel,</italic> and <italic>Burma</italic> oil ventures. While banking <italic>Shell</italic>, <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> depended on <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris. By 1908, the son of <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s Marcus Samuel married Rothschild cousin Montefiore. \nIn 1908, <italic>Shell</italic> entered the Romanian market by establishing <italic>Astra</italic>. Initially considering cartel proposals from <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s <italic>Star</italic>, <italic>Shell</italic> later pursued independent development. By 1910, <italic>Shell</italic> acquired <italic>Regatul Roman</italic>, forming <italic>Astra Romana</italic>, where it held a majority share in the board of directors. Minority positions were held by <italic>Bohrgesellschaft </italic>and <italic>Parisienne</italic>. <italic>Astra Romana</italic> emerged as the second-largest company in Romania, after <italic>Star</italic>.\nWhen <italic>Chartered Bank </italic>sought support of Britain\u2019s<italic> Foreign Office </italic>in 1905, HSBC organized an Anglo-French syndicate to do so. The two banks served as government bankers to various authorities in Malaya, with <italic>Chartered Bank</italic> acting as banker to the Malay Federation, and HSBC appointed as banker to the Johore State Government in 1910. As HSBC expanded to Malacca (1909), Kuala Lumpur (1909), Ipoh, and Johore Bharu (1910), without encroaching on other banks\u2019 business. While <italic>Borneo Co</italic> had become the banker for the White Rajah Brooke, <italic>Chartered</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Kuching branch became the only modern bank in Sabah and Sarawak from 1924 until after WWII. While HSBC focused on rubber and <italic>Chartered</italic> focused on tin in Malaysia, <italic>Mercantile</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> <italic>of India</italic> branched on Malaya\u2019s east coast at Kota Bharu (1911), Kuantan (1926), and Kuala Trengganu (1936).\nThe Huguenot Koechlin family had been bankers, manufacturers, and civil leaders of Alsace and Switzerland since the 17th century. Since the Koechlins kinterlinked with the co-religionist Dollfus in the 1770s, who themselves kinterlinked with the Schlumbergers for generations. Descended from a blacksmith guild chief in the 16th century and a slew of Mulhouse mayors, Daniel Dollfus founded a major cotton establishment in 1802. \nDollfus\u2019 daughter married  her second cousin Andr\u00e9 Koechlin, who led the cotton operation until starting a business for the casting of metals and the construction of machines with financing from <italic>Javal</italic>. In competition with <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne, Andr\u00e9 became the liquidator for the bankrupt shareholder in <italic>Stolberger Zinc</italic>, in 1852. In 1853, Koechlin bought <italic>Rhenish-Westphalian Co of Ramsbeck </italic>without shareholder approval, overextending financially. By 1855, Koechlin was insolvent and faced a fraud trial. As his Dollfus niece married a cousin of the Arnstein, Pressburger, and Wertheim  families in 1856, <italic>Koechlin</italic> came under Prussian management, with <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne overseeing its reorg and capital increase. \nWhile Jews helped link France internationally after the <italic>Franco-Prussian War </italic>of 1870, marriages within Alsace-Lorraine\u2019s native bourgeoisie, such as the Christian iron magnates Dietrich and Schlumberger remained mostly endogamous, aligning with pre-existing Huguenot social circles and cultural ties. By the time <italic>Dietrich</italic> reinforced kinterlinks with the T\u00fcrckheims by 1865 and Dietrich\u2019s cousin-in-law married a Mallet in 1868, the Schlumbergers were part of a crystallized community.\nThe same year that Schlumberger and Cazenove kinterlinked in 1861, Andr\u00e9 Koechlin\u2019s granddaughter Marie married Frankfurt banker Carl Grunelius, and Marie\u2019s sister wed Albert Mirabaud, her first cousin once removed, by 1876. By then a Mirabaud wed a Dollfus. Likewise, Albert\u2019s sister married Paul Schlumberger\u2019s second cousin. Andr\u00e9 Koechlin\u2019s great-nephews, brothers Maurice and Robert Koechlin, assisted Gustave Eiffel and specialized in hydroelectricity, respectively, and their brothers-in-law founded <italic>Franco-Swiss</italic><italic> Bank</italic> in 1894. \nRudolf Koechlin, their extended cousin, moved from Baden to Basel, married his extended LaRoche cousin, and followed as Head of <italic>Basler Handelsbank</italic> with board positions at <italic>Franco-Swiss, Credito Italiano</italic>, and <italic>Wiener.</italic> He also followed his extended cousin Theodore Schlumberger of the Mulhouse textile industrialists as president of the Alsace-Lorraine industrialists\u2019 syndicate. As the family amassed a fortune in the textile industry, Paul Schlumberger kinterlinked with the French PM from the 1830s. \nThe Koechlins also kinterlinked with the Iselin of Basel, who engaged trade and silk manufacturing from the 17th century and developed strong American connections. After Isaac Iselin emigrated to America in 1801 and became a New York merchant, his son Adrian followed as an importer and married the daughter of Baltimore financier Columbus O\u2019Donnell, connected with <italic>Baltimore & Ohio </italic>RR. Their daughter wed Colonel DeLancey Astor O\u2019Kane in 1872, linking the Iselins to the Rensselaer, Astor, and Roosevelt families. Transitioning from commerce, Adrien founded the banking house <italic>Iselin </italic>in New York. In 1906, Adrien granddaughter married a son of deceased banker Charles Livermore, whose widow had married Baron Seilli\u00e8re of <italic>Demachy Seilli\u00e8re</italic> in 1892.\nLikewise, Karl Koechlin Iselin served as a <italic>Swiss National Bank </italic>director in the late 19th century and a Swiss Iselin married Alfred Sarasin in 1890. The Sarasin family, originating from Lorraine, settled in Basel and founded a ribbon factory in the 17th century. From 1905, Alfred led <italic>Sarasin</italic>, which he made into the largest private banking house in Switzerland, and later served as VP of <italic>Swiss National Bank</italic>. His son worked for <italic>Brown</italic> New York.\nWhile German iron forger <italic>Dietrich</italic> kinterlinked with Huguenot banker <italic>Hottinguer</italic> in 1892, After France established tariffs in 1892, the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic> accelerated consolidation as Britain\u2019s Court legalized cartels in the public interest starting with shipping. Since German Kaiser Wilhelm II supported striking coalers in 1889, advocating international labor reforms, including cartels and female and child employment limits, the <italic>Ruhr</italic> <italic>Coal </italic>cartel organized. By 1894, <italic>Johnson</italic>,<italic> Quennessen</italic>, and <italic>Heraeus</italic> refiners cartelized into <italic>PLATINUM</italic>. After marry-partnering into <italic>Heraeus</italic>, Charles Engelhard managed American operations. \nAmong the many notable marriages of the era consolidating enterprises, the daughter of Carl Grunelius and married in 1895 Guillaume Mallet, whose sister H\u00e9l\u00e8ne married Maurice Dietrich T\u00fcrckheim soon after. By 1896, <italic>Mirabaud</italic> banker Gustave Mirabaud married a sister of Lyon banking heir Charles Cambefort, who became a Director of <italic>Comptoir</italic> a year earlier, with directorships in many mining, public works, and railroad companies. After Marie Koechlin\u2019s second married a son of Spanish miner <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic>\u2019s Managing Director Charles Dedoux in 1898, and Berthe Mirabaud wed Robert Schlumberger in 1900, leading <italic>Mirabaud</italic> to create <italic>Mines de Bor</italic> and develop Serbia\u2019s metallurgy as the country\u2019s largest industrial investment from 1904. By 1908, <italic>Vernes</italic> and <italic>Mirabaud</italic> kinterlinked as did Daniel Schlumberger and T\u00fcrckheim\u2019s niece.\nSince a LaRoche heiress married Fritz Hoffmann\u2014of a family that gained Basel citizenship in the 16th century, shifting from shoe cobbling to goldsmithing\u2014who took her surname, Basel silk merchant Friedrich Hoffmann established the pharmaceutical<italic> Hoffmann LaRoche </italic>in 1896. With <italic>Basler Handelsban</italic>k\u2019s Rudolf Koechlin as his brother-in-law, Fritz Hoffmann LaRoche rapidly grew the company, focusing on standardized packaging, high product quality, and brand pioneering.\nWith growing African mining speculation,<italic> Rothschild</italic> led <italic>Hirsch</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Beit</italic>, and others to control mining. Between 1892 and 1894, <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC launched <italic>Rand Mines</italic>, <italic>Geldenhuis</italic>, <italic>Goldfields of Mashonaland</italic>, <italic>Consolidated Deep Level</italic> <italic>Co</italic>, <italic>Jumpers Deep Levels</italic>, and <italic>Transvaal & General Association</italic>. Since refusing stabilizing monopolization ventures for copper, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London parlayed <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC funds to buy <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>, invest in Mexican copper miner <italic>Boleo</italic>,<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic>join <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, Cassel, <italic>Lewisohn</italic>, <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt</italic>, and others to cartelize global copper into <italic>COPPER </italic>using <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> as counsel. \nSince <italic>Baring</italic> failed<italic> </italic>in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London diversified <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC into mines across Australia, Mexico, and Alaska, and with the safer London PUs, adding investment from <italic>Smyth</italic>, Cassel, <italic>Beit</italic>, and <italic>Gibbs</italic> in 1895. Since <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris invested in <italic>Mirabaud</italic>\u2019s Mexican copper miner <italic>Boleo </italic>in the 1880s, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC invested in <italic>Boleo</italic> and <italic>COPPER</italic> in 1895. \nThat year, <italic>Mirabaud</italic> absorbed <italic>Eichthal</italic> as Marguerite Mirabaud married William Eichthal who became Managing Partner. Likewise,<italic> Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Speyer cousin Schiff\u2019s sister wed a fellow Katz-cousin Warburg, a cousin of Frankfurt Goldschmidts and Oppenheims<italic>.</italic> By 1899, <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC and <italic>Disconto</italic> founded <italic>Otavi</italic> RR in Berlin, acquiring 1,000 square miles in German Southwest Africa, including the Otavi, Little Otavi, Anwap, and Tsumeb copper mines.  \nLike in other industries, previous attempts to control brass prices and production through agreements failed due to competition and evasion. In 1899, enterprises owned by <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> and other capitalists consolidated to form <italic>BRASS</italic> to stabilize a competitive and volatile market, which came to control two-thirds of American brass production and a third of the nation\u2019s copper consumption.\nSince a Smyth heiress married a <italic>Hambro</italic> heir in 1894, her sister wed one of the three junior partners. As BOE Governor Hugh Smyth led BOE, his in-law governed West Australia, and his cousin Herbert Smyth represented the founding <italic>Smyth</italic> family at <italic>Jardine</italic>. Lancelot Smyth became the third partner of the new brokerage <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic>. While <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> criticism forced<italic> </italic>Martin Smyth of <italic>Smyth</italic><italic> </italic>and other <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC founders to abolish a lucrative profit-sharing system in 1895, <italic>Smyth</italic>\u2019s Gerard Smyth became a director. \nAfter <italic>Barclay Bevan</italic> defensively merged with twenty Quaker cousin banks under Bevan and Smyth-in-law leadership with <italic>Samuel</italic> investment in 1896, <italic>Midland Bank</italic> bought <italic>Bank of Westmorland</italic>, <italic>Preston Banking</italic>, <italic>Carlisle City & District Bank</italic>, <italic>Channel Islands Bank</italic>, <italic>Huddersfield Banking</italic>, <italic>North Western Bank</italic>, <italic>Oldham Joint Stock Bank</italic>, <italic>City of Birmingham Bank</italic>, <italic>Leicestershire Banking</italic>, <italic>Sheffield Union Bank</italic>, and <italic>Yorkshire </italic><italic>Banking</italic> by 1901. After <italic>Lloyd</italic> acquired <italic>Pease</italic>, Beaumont Pease remained executives and later and kinterlinked with <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s Keswick. Another <italic>Barclay</italic> cousin, William Barclay Peat, became an accountant and would later form the \u2018P\u2019 in KPMG.\nIn 1899, <italic>Smyth</italic><italic> Payn</italic>e of London resisted a proposal from <italic>Smyth</italic> <italic>Ellison</italic> of Lincoln to consolidate various Smyth cousin banks, with septuagenarian Samuel II refusing discussions at his Belgrave Square home. While the Smyths were long related by marriage to Bevan and other Quaker <italic>Barclay</italic> directors, <italic>Smyth</italic> sold out to Leo Schuster-led<italic> </italic><italic>Union Bank of London</italic> in 1902, where Speyer cousins Schuster served as Governor and <italic>Beit</italic> Co-Head Julius Wernher continued his directorship.\nAround 1900, a Smyth heiress married a cousin of the Finlay, Campbell, and Bevan West Indies traders Scottish and Quaker cousinhood. Following the death of the Chair of<italic> Finlay Campbell</italic> John Muir in 1903, his son inherited the firm and merged with Charles Perkins Forbes. Likewise, Colin Campbell joined <italic>National Provincial</italic>\u2019s board, and invested in Indian textiles and sugar. \nSince Scot <italic>Finlay</italic> merged with <italic>Baring</italic> in the 1860s, Campbell kinterlinked with fellow West Indies merchants Bevan in 1873, and Finlay-in-law James Campbell and his nephews founding <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> Bombay, with directors on <italic>Indian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>\u2019s board. A <italic>Smyth</italic> cousin-in-law and had married <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s Bevan West Indies sugar merchant banking family, Colin Campbell\u2019s son William was BOE\u2019s Deputy Governor from 1905 and Governor from 1907. Likewise, <italic>Horsfall</italic> kinterlinked Smyth to the West African palm oil trade since in 1891.\nSince <italic>Drexel </italic>appointed Bremen Consul John Harjes in 1868 to represent the firm in Paris and Junius Morgan in London by 1871, Anthony Drexel\u2019s sons did not want to take over management of the bank when he died in 1893. So, <italic>Drexel</italic> and <italic>Harjes</italic> soon fused into <italic>Morgan</italic>. Since Earl Albert Grey replaced Cecil Rhodes as Administrator of Rhodesia in 1894, Consuelo Astor married a Churchill-Spencer in 1895, Spencer\u2019s Egerton cousins married a British born and ennobled Huguenot Tehllusson two years later. \nThen in 1898, a Grenfell cousin<italic> </italic>partner of <italic>Morton </italic>London wed Lilian Churchill-Spencer, Earl Grey\u2019s niece married Vivian Smyth, and <italic>Standard Bank</italic> made Smyth-in-law Charles Fremantle her Chair. As the <italic>Baring</italic> failure led <italic>Morton </italic>London to dissolve in 1899, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s trainee Arthur Grenfell partnered with his extended cousin Ernest Chapin to form <italic>Chapin</italic> <italic>Grenfell</italic>, while <italic>Morgan</italic> promoted his cousin Walter Spencer Morgan Burns to partner and hired Arthur\u2019s cousin Edward Grenfell as his London agent.\nIn 1901, Arthur Grenfell married Earl Grey\u2019s daughter and joined the boards of <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> and several African mining ventures. (Likewise, three Grey and Baring cousins wed Grenfells, diversifying their <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Glyn </italic>connections.) As Rhodes died in 1902, Earl Grey formed <italic>Charter</italic> to conduct trust business for <italic>South Africa Co</italic>, and his son-in-law Grenfell joined <italic>Charter</italic>\u2019s board and raised a loan for Rhodesia. \nBy then, German Namibia granted <italic>German Colonial Co</italic> land rights, where diamond discoveries destabilized <italic>DeBeers</italic>\u2019 cartel, leading to another syndicate in 1903, this time eight firms, adding <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter </italic>and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC. Since <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC <italic>Disconto</italic> founded <italic>Otavi</italic> RR in 1899, <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris invested in related copper ventures in 1903. Like in other countries, <italic>Otavi</italic> RR\u2019s concession sought 20 kilometers on either side of the railroad. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Morgan</italic> consolidated American interests. <italic>Morgan</italic> extended cousin-in-laws already led banks nationally. Since John Morgan\u2019s cousin-in-law <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic>\u2019s Edward Adams was elected President of <italic>Cataract Construction</italic> to tap the hydroelectric potential of Niagara Falls in 1890, he assembled experts which led him to select <italic>Westinghouse</italic>\u2019s alternating current over GE in 1893. The same year that Adams resigned from <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic> to represent <italic>Deutsche</italic> in America and reorganized <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR. \nA third cousin once removed of John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife, William Huntington Perkins was born in Athens, Pennsylvania, and not closely related to Thomas Handasyd Perkins. His banking career commenced in 1881 in New York City, where he quickly advanced within <italic>Importers & Traders</italic> NB. At the age of 31, in 1890, Perkins became presidency of <italic>Bank of America</italic>, the state\u2019s youngest bank president. His brother George presided over <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB at the time.\nNew <italic>Morgan</italic> partners from 1895 included in-laws and prominent heirs. <italic>Morgan</italic> added George Perkins of <italic>New York</italic> LIC <italic>& Trust</italic> (and an in-law of President Lincoln\u2019s UST Secretary Salmon Chase\u2019s old law partner) and Edward Whitney, neither closely related to Boston Brahmins or William Whitney. Like Edward Whitney was associated with <italic>Rogers</italic>, new partners Robert Bacon and Charles Coster with affiliated with <italic>Lee</italic> <italic>Hugginson</italic> and <italic>Fabbri Chauncey</italic>, respectively. A relative of Philadelphia merchant bankers, Arthur Newbold linked to George Dallas, President James Polk\u2019s VP under and President Franklin Pierce\u2019s Ambassador to Britain, via his wife. \nCoster was a grandson of a Knickerbocker Dutch East and West Indies trader of the late 18th century and <italic>Prime</italic>\u2019s Nathaniel Prime. An extended <italic>Lee</italic><italic> </italic>cousin, Boston Brahmin William Bacon was prominent in the China trade and served as <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s agent. His son Robert befriended Theodore Roosevelt at <italic>Harvard</italic> before starting at <italic>Lee</italic>. Since Bacon joined in 1896, several <italic>Morgan</italic> partners remained on <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s board into WWI. After <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings Bank</italic> in Chicago President John Mitchell married <italic>Prime</italic> cousin in 1890, <italic>Prime</italic> cousin Pierson Hamilton married John Morgan\u2019s daughter and became a partner of <italic>Morgan</italic> by 1895.\nSince her key patent expired in 1893, <italic>Bell</italic> lowered prices to grow market share. During the 1900 HC boom, <italic>Morgan</italic> reorged <italic>Bell</italic> into <italic>American Telephone & Telegraph</italic> (\u201cAT&T\u201d) with financing from <italic>First </italic>NB <italic>of New York</italic> and <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic> of Boston, gaining control from <italic>Lee</italic>. After forming the world\u2019s largest HC, <italic>STEEL,</italic> in 1901, <italic>Morgan</italic> united Canadian copper and nickel miners into <italic>NICKEL</italic>. To prevent vertical integration and rate wars, <italic>Morgan</italic> fused farm equipment manufactures into <italic>HARVESTER</italic>. \nAlong with Clement Griscom\u2014a Philadelphia shipper as well as a director of <italic>PENN</italic> and <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s largest pipe, descended from Thomas Lloyd and a Biddle in-law\u2014<italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>combined trans-Atlantic shipping into <italic>International Mercantile Marine </italic>(\u201c<italic>SHIP</italic>\u201d), which soon only the <italic>Titanic</italic>. Griscom\u2019s son married a <italic>Prime</italic> cousin and William Duer\u2019s great-granddaughter in 1901, connecting to the Harriman, Speyer, and other families. \nAnglo-Americans partnered with Germany. Brit Weetman Pearson expanded contractor <italic>Pearson</italic> into Mexican oil and high-profile projects such as New York City\u2019s <italic>Hudson Tunnel</italic> and streetcars in Barcelona. As his son, Weetman II, married <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Grenfell</italic>, and <italic>Grey</italic> cousin Agnes Churchill-Spencer in 1905, Agnes\u2019 cousin Winston married Clementine Ogilvy Hozier in 1908. Clementine was the daughter of Gladstone cousin Lady Ogilvy and Henry Montague Hozier, a Scottish military officer and secretary of <italic>Lloyd</italic>. (Winston\u2019s uncle had married the daughter of Leonard Jerome\u2014a partner of <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s American agent <italic>Belmont</italic>\u2014in 1874.\nSince Lazarus Hallgarten\u2019s granddaughters married a Franchetti cousin-in-law of the Rothschilds and Fuggers as well as a descendant of Joseph Goldschmidt at the turn of the century, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Mortimer Schiff married a <italic>Hallgarten</italic> partner\u2019s daughter in 1901. After <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s Carl F\u00fcrstenberg became a silent partner at <italic>Hallgarten</italic> in 1903, <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s Hans Winterfeldt joined as partner. And in 1905, Pauline Lehman married Speyer cousin Henry Ickelheimer of stockbrokerage <italic>Heidelbach Ickelheimer</italic> and promoted electric industries. \nLikewise, Cassel, <italic>Beit</italic>, <italic>Franco-Swiss Bank</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC underwrote central electric railroad stations in London and Paris and colonial PUs. While  Winterfeldt resigned from <italic>Hallgarten</italic> to join <italic>Speyer</italic> in 1908, <italic>Hallgarten</italic> promoted F\u00fcrstenberg\u2019s son to partner and added Max Horwitz from <italic>Schweizerischer</italic>, which soon became known as<italic> </italic><italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>. (The same year, a Lutheran <italic>Hallgarten</italic> heiress converted to Catholicism to marry a Spanish Marquis.)\nParallelly, James White was born in Pennsylvania to a colonial family and the sister of Gen. James Beaver, Governor of Pennsylvania, and graduated <italic>Pennsylvania State College</italic> in 1882 and earned a PhD from <italic>Cornell</italic> in electrical engineering and physics by 1885. After co-founded <italic>Western Engineering Co</italic> in 1887, White sold it to <italic>Edison United Manufacturing</italic> in 1890. Subsequently, he managed railway installations for the <italic>Edison</italic> interests in New York and later established his own engineering and contracting firm, <italic>JG White</italic>. \nLike other engineers, <italic>JG White</italic> started <italic>Associated </italic>PUHC and raised funding from <italic>Westinghouse</italic> and <italic>Speyer</italic> to develop global PUs in 1903. As America and the Philippine Commission initiated railway construction in 1905, <italic>Speyer</italic> focused on two lines in the south of Luzon, while<italic> JG White</italic> joined a syndicate including <italic>International Banking Corp</italic>, <italic>Vanderbilt</italic>, <italic>Heidelbach Ickelheimer</italic> for three lines in Cebu, Panay, and Negros.\nSoon after Earl Grey became Governor of Canada in 1904, his son-in-law refocused <italic>Chapin</italic> <italic>Grenfell</italic> to speculate in securities there. As what soon-became <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Grenfell </italic>promoted Edward Grenfell to partner in 1904, the latter brought his cousin Vivian Smyth, the eldest son of former BOE Governor Hugh Smyth in 1905, <italic>Morgan</italic> also formed an alliance with German <italic>Dresdner Bank</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Westinghouse</italic> retained <italic>Benson</italic> to float <italic>Westinghouse</italic> Britain in 1899, GE bought out <italic>Siemens</italic>\u2019 American operations in 1900, GGE exchanged patents with GE in 1903 and made agreements with <italic>Siemens</italic>. (When the three formally shared patents in 1912, <italic>Siemens</italic> suggested including <italic>Westinghouse</italic>, but GGE opposed bolstering <italic>Westinghouse</italic>.) As Ruhr coal electrified, Hugo Stinnes bought <italic>Rhenish-Westphalian Electric</italic> (\u201cRWE\u201d) PU and consolidated municipal PUs while adding city officials to the board. By 1904, <italic>Ruhr</italic> <italic>Steel </italic>surpassed <italic>STEEL</italic>\u2019s efficacy. \nFrom 1905, <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>and <italic>Dresdner</italic> raised capital and co-founded <italic>Sudamerikanische Bank</italic> in Berlin to promote German commerce with South America with initial branches in Hamburg, Buenos Aires, and Mexico. <italic>Dresdner</italic>, <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, and <italic>Nationalbank</italic> also co-founded <italic>Orientbank</italic> in Berlin that year. Initially operating branches in Constantinople and Hamburg, <italic>Orientbank</italic> later branched to Alexandria, Brussa, Cairo, Kalamata, Izmir, and Casablanca. In the mining sector, <italic>Dresdner </italic>participated in the 1905 Chinese state loan, <italic>Tehuantepec National</italic> RR\u2019s loan, and two Japanese gold loans.\nDespite being Africa\u2019s main basin, South Africa mined little coal. Emil Rathenau\u2019s son, Walther, managed <italic>Elektrochemische Werke</italic> while serving on GGE\u2019s board from 1899. Walther resigned in 1902 after other directors refused his proposal to take over the rival <italic>Schuckert</italic> it centralized GGE too much. Joining <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s Board that year, Walther later returned to GGE\u2019s after <italic>Siemens</italic> took over <italic>Schuckert</italic>, and GGE\u2019s bought UEG in 1904. \nAlong with expanding GGE into Austria, UEG\u2019s PUHC (\u201cBGGE\u201d) hired Dannie Heineman, born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to a Jewish American father and Jewish German. After his father died, Dannie grew up in Hanover, Germany, and required grants for college. He joined UEG in Berlin and worked on electrification projects across Europe. In 1905, he became the Managing Director of BGGE in Brussels, which he grew into a global player in electric production and distribution. With backing from Belgian banks and German institutions like <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Dresdner</italic>. By 1910, Heineman wed Hettie Meyer of Hanover, a Katz Frankel descendant of Samuel Oppenheim and cousin of Chief Rabbi of Britain Nathan Adler.\nThrough UEG, Walther met <italic>Beit </italic>of London. With funds from <italic>Erlanger</italic>,<italic> Beit</italic>, who banked Rhodes\u2019 <italic>South Africa</italic> RHC and <italic>Rand Gold</italic>, began a free market approach for linking hydroelectricity from Victoria Falls to distant gold mines. However, Walther Rathenau envisioned a centralized electricity supply. Although GGE helped<italic> Beit</italic> develop the monopoly<italic> </italic><italic>Victoria Falls Power</italic>, <italic>Victoria</italic> shifted away from hydroelectricity to coal for power. \nAfter<italic> Berliner </italic>established <italic>Deutsche Colonial </italic>RR<italic> & Port</italic> <italic>Construction</italic> in 1904,<italic> </italic>Germany ended <italic>German Colonial Co</italic>\u2019s exclusive rights in Namibia in 1905. As <italic>Berliner </italic>built <italic>L\u00fcderitzbucht-Kubub</italic> RR in Namibia and operated <italic>Usambara</italic> RR in German East Africa. While GGE\u2019s Emil Rathenau founded <italic>German Southwest African Mining Syndicate</italic> and an irrigation company in 1907, <italic>Berliner </italic>co-founded <italic>German Diamond </italic>by 1911. Rathenau\u2019s financier Jacob Lando had kinterlinked with Ludwig Asser Kaufmann, a baptized second great grandson of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, nephew-in-law of <italic>Oppenheim </italic>Cologne, and nephew-in-law of Cologne-born Robert Esser, who chaired <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>and <italic>Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Bodenkreditbank</italic>, and served on the boards of thirteen others, including <italic>Dresdner</italic> and <italic>South Cameroon</italic>.\nScandinavian banking also evolved since the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>. Back in 1864, <italic>Skandinaviska Kredit</italic> became Sweden\u2019s first non-note-issuing private deposit bank, to fund trade under the leadership of Theodor Mannheim. Having served as a <italic>Sk\u00e5nes</italic> commissioner, Mannheim was the nephew of Vienna\u2019s unofficial rabbi and in-law of the Melchiors, who were related to the Goldschmidt, Warburg, Rapha\u00ebl, and Ballin families. Soon after,<italic> </italic>domestic-focused deposit banks spread. Starting in Stockholm<italic> </italic>in 1871,<italic> Svenska Handel</italic> branched to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden\u2019s match hub. After the Crown bailed out <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> as depositors ran, <italic>Riksbank</italic> received a note issuance monopoly with increased Crown influence by 1878.\nWhile the Wallenbergs evolved <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> from a note-issuing deposit bank into an industrial bank, Danish <italic>Privatbanken</italic> became a German-style universal bank combining retail banking with corporate finance under Christian Carl Tietgen. Tietgen apprenticed in Odense, and in 1848 traveled to Manchester to work. He returned to Denmark in 1855 and established <italic>Tietgen</italic> in Copenhagen. In 1857, he was appointed director of <italic>Privatbanken</italic>. During the <italic>Panic of </italic><italic>1857</italic>, Tietgen arranged liquidity loans for distressed trading houses. \nTietgen then founded or co-founded <italic>Danske S\u00f8fartsselskab</italic> (1865), <italic>Kryolith Mine </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Trading Co</italic> (1865), <italic>Copenhagen Tram Co</italic> (1866), <italic>United Steamship</italic> (1866), <italic>Danish-Norwegian-English Telegraph Co</italic> (1868), <italic>Danish-Russian Telegraph Co</italic> (1868), <italic>Great Northern Telegraph Co</italic> (1869), <italic>China & Japan Extension Telegraph Co</italic> (1870), <italic>EZ Svitzers Salvage Enterprise </italic>(1872), <italic>Danish Sugar Factories</italic> (1872), <italic>Danish Chicory Factories</italic> (1872), <italic>Copenhagen Construction Co</italic> (1872), and <italic>Paribas</italic><italic> </italic>(1872). Withdrawing due to the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, he resumed formations in the 1880s. In 1881, he secured for <italic>Great Northern</italic> a 20-year monopoly on China\u2019s telegraph connections. However, poor health debilitated him by the 1890s.\nBy 1894, Theodor Mannheim\u2019s son married Samson Wertheim\u2019s fifth great-grandson. That year, Cassel acquired an interest in <italic>Swedish Association</italic> to merge railways, Oxel\u00f6sund harbor installations, and potentially mines. Seeking local support, he initially discussed this with <italic>Skandinaviska Kredit </italic>and soon established <italic>Gr\u00e4ngesberg Oxel\u00f6sund Traffic</italic>, largely held <italic>Kredit</italic> on behalf of <italic>Swedish Association</italic>. \nWith <italic>Kredit</italic> suspicions about Cassel\u2019s attempts to inflate share prices to transfer profits to London. most shares ended up in Swedish hands over time, benefiting <italic>Kredit</italic> immensely. Cassel\u2019s alliance with <italic>Kredit</italic> challenged <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>\u2019s Wallenbergs, who were active in local mining. After selling his G\u00e4llivare mines to <italic>Gr\u00e4ngesberg</italic> in 1903, Wallenberg lamented the influence of Cassel and other foreign interests.\nSince Theodor Mannheim\u2019s sister-in-law married a Magnez in 1875, his daughter married a Philipson by 1882. Since Philip Katz\u2019s son Mauritz adopted the surname Philipson and engaged in publishing and banking via <italic>Philip</italic>, his<italic> </italic>sons Carl and John shaped industry. Along with Eduard Magnez, Carl helped modernize Holmen\u2019s mill and factory in Norrk\u00f6ping into a cotton spinning mill in 1854 and managed family, directed a private bank, and expanded into consulship, city council membership, and board positions. \nAfter moving to Stockholm in 1872, he continued to engage in diverse business activities and remained a city council member.<italic> </italic>His brother John married Eduard Magnez\u2019s daughter and helped manage <italic>Philip </italic>before the firm closed in 1870. Subsequently, John led <italic>Skandinaviska Kredit</italic>\u2019s Norrk\u00f6ping branch and his son Lars married the CEO\u2019s daughter in the early 1880s. After this wife died in the 1890s, Lars married Lily Warburg at the turn of the century. Likewise, Max Oppenheim Warburg wed his cousin, an Odessa-born granddaughter of the Hamburg Magnez. \nAlthough a quarter of Hamburg\u2019s Jews soon married outside the faith and assimilated, the families continued to reinforce and create new kinterlinks via marriage and apprenticeship. In 1908, Max\u2019s brother Fritz married his Swedish extended Warburg cousin. <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg\u2014along with <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>\u2014also hosted cousin Otto Henriques as an apprentice before he became Partner at his family\u2019s <italic>Henriques</italic> in Copenhagen. \nAround the same time, Philipson kinterlinked with Louis Fraenckel. Fraenckel was born in Aschersleben, Prussia, in 1851 to Joseph (of unclear lineage) and Karolina Heinemann. Heinemann\u2019s cousin was the Chief Rabbi of Gothenburg at the time, working for reform with the Henriques and Warburg families. As Karolina\u2019s brother became Carl served as the Prussian consul general in Stockholm, Fraenckel moved there in 1874. Executing Carl\u2019s will after his death, Louis Fraenckel began arranging mortgage institution loans for <italic>Sveriges Allm\u00e4nna Hypoteksbank</italic> and others in the 1870s through German capital market connections.\nAfter meeting <italic>Erlanger</italic>, Fraenckel became the firm\u2019s agent in 1877, and established his bank <italic>Fraenckel</italic> in 1880 with <italic>Erlanger</italic>\u2019s support. Already destabilized, <italic>Svenska Handel</italic> teetered during the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic> before Fraenckel bought a directorship, soon hiring a Philipson in-law and forming cooperation agreements with <italic>Sk\u00e5nska Handel</italic>, <italic>G\u00f6teborgs Handel</italic>, and other banks. He also organized sugar and brewing mergers. While Fraenckel led mortgages, <italic>Wallenberg</italic>, supported by Gl\u00fcckstadt, entered the market in the late 1880s.\nWith a Danish Goldschmidt mother, Isaac Gl\u00fcckstadt married a Warburg-cousin Delbanco, and grew the new <italic>Danish</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic> into the country\u2019s largest bank from 1872. After co-founding a bank and shipping line to connect Copenhagen with the Far East to compete with British and German counterparts in 1892, Gl\u00fcckstadt\u2019s son wed a R\u00e9e, related to Oppenheim, Warburg, and Levita families by 1895. The Far East syndicate also established with leadership roles in <italic>Siam Electric</italic> and <italic>Danish West Indi</italic><italic>es</italic><italic> National Bank</italic>.\nIn the competition for Scandinavian loans,<italic> </italic><italic>Warburg</italic>, <italic>Henriques</italic>, and <italic>Svenska Handel</italic>\u2019s Louis Fraenckel partnered against the rival bloc of Wallenberg\u2019s <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Danish</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic>, and <italic>Behrens</italic> of Hamburg. Between 1891 and 1914, Scandinavia called upon the Paris financial markets more frequently than any other region in the world. <italic>Lyonnais </italic>syndicated most of the 34 loans issued by Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland.\nWhile <italic>Parbias</italic>\u2019 Finaly funded the Transvaal (1903), he lost the Swedish loan to <italic>Dresdner</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>. By 1904, <italic>Paribas</italic> joined Wallenberg\u2019s <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> and in the Norwegian loan with<italic> Lyonnais. </italic>The finance minister chose the Franco-Swedish consortium over <italic>Deutsche</italic> with <italic>Comptoir</italic> for political reasons. Later, Finaly went to America to strengthen <italic>Paribas\u2019</italic> ties there, leading to the idea of a lasting partnership with <italic>Warburg</italic>-kinterlinked <italic>Kuhn</italic> to involve French capital in the American financial market\u2019s growth.\nOne reason was that Andre Wallenberg\u2019s son Knut apprenticed with <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, thus entering French syndicates. While his sister married the son of <italic>Hypoteksbank</italic>\u2019s Chair in 1900, Knut partnered with <italic>Comptoir</italic> and entered the French market public debt market in 1901 and, with support from <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, won the Swedish government loan in 1904. After securing the <italic>Norges Hypotekbank</italic> loan, Wallenberg targeted <italic>Fraenckel</italic>\u2019s relationship with <italic>Sveriges Allm\u00e4nna Hypoteksbank</italic>, using his family ties and placing one of <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>\u2019s director on the board.\nSince Knut married a Norwegian, <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> dominated Norwegian sovereign loans and co-funded <italic>Norge</italic> <italic>Centralbank</italic>, <italic>Kristiania Realbank</italic>, <italic>Norwegian Hydro</italic> by 1905. As the primary negotiator for Nordic loans, Knut apportioned Scandinavian securities to<italic> Lyonnais</italic> in France and <italic>Warburg</italic> everywhere else. <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> pioneered IHCs to expand and consolidate international industries. \nLeading a consortium for telephony in Moscow and Warsaw and establishing <italic>Svensk-Dansk-Ryska Telefon</italic> in 1900, Marcus Wallenberg also promoted <italic>Mexikanska Telefon Ericsson</italic>, with while retaining a 20% stake. As <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> mostly owned Sweden\u2019s electro-chemical complex, ASEA. Along with a French group led by <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, they faced competition from German electro-engineering firms, and formed an agreement with GGE<italic> Sweden</italic>, GE, a <italic>Disconto</italic>-backed chemical combine, and, at <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 suggestion <italic>Westinghouse</italic>. \nInitially, Knut and Marcus grew <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>, while their brother Gustaf served as a diplomat in Tokyo, Peking, and Constantinople. Along with the diplomatic connections, Wallenberg included Danish <italic>Gl\u00fcckstadt</italic> in syndicates with reciprocity for investing in <italic>Siam Commercial Bank</italic>, <italic>Siam Electric</italic> (1898), <italic>Northern Country Bank</italic> in Paris (1911), and <italic>British Bank of Northern Commerce</italic> in 1912. \nOnly in 1907 did <italic>Svenska Handel</italic> together with <italic>Skandinaviska Kredit </italic>float an IHC. New agreements for Wallenberg\u2019s Scandinavian syndicates in 1910 and 1912 led <italic>Warburg</italic> to relinquish rights in Britain while maintaining German, American, Dutch, and Swiss monopolies. After 1912, Marcus continued leading <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>, while Knut increasingly involved himself in politics, serving as Foreign Affairs Minister during WWI. \nFailing to start a Thai bank in the 1890s, <italic>Gl\u00fcckstadt</italic> and <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> joined the Thai royal aristocracy and Chinese merchants in founding <italic>Siam Commercial Bank </italic>by 1906, which emerged as the most prosperous after Thailand liberalized banking laws. Chinese merchants and millers joined the while at the domestic level, market control was exerted by small local banks, remittance agents, and pawnshops. After banker Seow Joo Seng set up the first, <italic>Chino-Siamese Bank</italic>, in 1908, followed by the largest local merchant Kim Seng Lee, rice exporter Lee Teck Oh, and tax farmer and rice miller Siang Kee Chan.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panic of 1907</italic>\nAfter President Jackson killed the federal banknote monopoly, Southern states chartered banks to build railroads with rented slaves. To position Atlanta as a grain hub, Georgia subsidized chartered railroads to coal deposits in Tennessee\u2019s Chattanooga by 1852, which Virginia\u2019s <italic>Richmond</italic> RR and Nashville via <italic>Tennessee Coal & Iron</italic> RHC (\u201c<italic>COALT</italic>\u201d) also soon connected into. By 1859, <italic>Louisville</italic> <italic>& Nashville RR </italic>(\u201cL&N\u201d) linked coal-rich Kentucky to the Mississippi River via Nashville. Although Tennessee\u2019s Memphis is on the Mississippi River, Louisiana controlled New Orleans and the Court prevented inter-state charters. \nBut timber was cheap relative to coal before the <italic>Civil</italic> <italic>War</italic>, forcing <italic>Tennessee</italic> to reorg debt after the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>. With the spread of investment, Thomas Marr established a security house in Nashville in 1857 and founded <italic>Nashville Savings Co</italic> around 1860. When the Democrat party splintered over free<italic> </italic>labor and tariffs, Tennessee\u2019s commerce interests clashed with Southern slavery ideologies and subscribed to Union values.\nWhile Maryland coalers were pro-Union, Baltimore destroyed her bridges and the coal trade collapsed by 1861. Nashville allowed Confederate soldiers to destroy steamboats but protected L&N. After establishing a wartime depot there, the Union extended L&N to win the war with Kentucky coal. After the <italic>Civil War</italic>, the South lost her cotton dominance as British textile merchants developed coal and cotton in India and Egypt<italic>.</italic> Still trade resumed as Nashville-born Tom Ryman expanded his commercial fishing business by purchasing his first steamboat in 1865 along the Cumberland River. \nWith Union victory, free Blacks pushed to subdivide them into plots. Similarly, LA1866 limited Deep South commercial timber and mining for a decade. Although Alabama\u2019s governor vetoed public aid for railroads in the 1850s, the Confederacy eased restrictions during the <italic>Civil War</italic>. Under a carpetbag regime, Alabama outbuilt the South, indorsing the debt of <italic>Union Pacific RR</italic> (\u201cUPR\u201d) to link Birmingham iron to Chattanooga coal. However, as they defaulted, L&N assumed the state\u2019s obligations and control in 1871 with financing from <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Baring</italic>. \nAfter <italic>Richmond</italic>, <italic>East Tennessee</italic>, <italic>Virginia</italic> & <italic>Georgia</italic> RR formed in 1869, <italic>Roosevelt</italic> funding helped L&N and <italic>PENN</italic> organize a Southern pool and combined <italic>Richmond</italic>, <italic>East Tennessee</italic>, <italic>Virginia</italic> & <italic>Georgia</italic> RR with Virginia\u2019s<italic> Richmond</italic> in a Pennsylvania RHC by 1871. As the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> resumed rate wars, <italic>PENN</italic> split the<italic> </italic>RHC and renewed competition. When Alabama lost access to credit, <italic>Lehman</italic> bought her bonds and started a SB in Queens, New York. \nWhile Tom Ryman organized his Chattanooga steamboats into three packet lines, L&N brought <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s kerosene into the South and expanded the pool to produce and the Midwest in 1875. By 1877, John Calhoun\u2019s grandson Patrick Calhoun raised funding from <italic>Clark</italic>, <italic>Belmont</italic>, <italic>Lehman</italic>, and <italic>Seligman</italic> for <italic>Atlanta-Tennessee-Saint-Louis </italic>RR to attract Southern cotton and Midwestern grain to Atlanta. \nBy 1880, Emanuel Lehman joined New York financiers to re-establish <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB of New York. Since William Saint-John\u2014son of Alabama\u2019s <italic>Saint-John Powers</italic> banker Newton Saint-John\u2014joined his in-laws at New York\u2019s <italic>Alexander</italic> after the <italic>Civil War</italic>, he held positions with various firms, including <italic>Fabbri Chauncey</italic>, <italic>Phelps Dodge </italic>copper, and <italic>Havemeyer </italic>sugar refiner. \nIn 1881, Saint-John was appointed cashier of <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB. Two years later, he was promoted to the presidency of the bank, also becoming a director of <italic>Second</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> and other banks. With Northern capital, <italic>Lehman</italic> expanded from factoring to manufacturing in Alabama, including a cotton mill on the Tallapoosa River, and Southern railroads. While Emanuel Lehman was a <italic>Richmond </italic>director, his brother Mayer chaired <italic>Montgomery-Tuscaloosa</italic> RR.\nAlso in 1880, L&N gained control of <italic>Tennessee-Saint-Louis </italic>RR and collaborated with Jay Gould against Collis Huntington, who expanded his <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR and <italic>Southern Pacific</italic> RR. The foreclosure of <italic>Atlantic, Mississippi, & Ohio</italic> RR posed another challenge. Despite support from <italic>Atlantic</italic>\u2019s president and the involvement of prominent London houses, John Collinson faced opposition in merging the two. Eventually, Clarence Clark, senior <italic>Clark</italic> partner and L&N director, outbid Collinson in the foreclosure sale, leading to the establishment of <italic>Norfolk & Western</italic> RR in 1881, which focused primarily on coal interests and sought connections with Tennessee before turning to the coal-rich mountains of Virginia. <italic>Atlantic</italic>\u2019s northern portion, <italic>New York, Pennsylvania, & Ohio RR,</italic> listed on NYSE and leased herself to <italic>Erie</italic> RR. \nAfter Jere Baxter reorganized <italic>Tennessee Coal & Iron</italic> (\u201c<italic>COALT</italic>\u201d) RHC in 1866, he linked British collieries in 1875, and acquired them in 1882. Baxter\u2019s brother Nathenial was a director of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Nashville</italic>, which absorbed <italic>Mechanics</italic> NB in 1880, and in 1883, merged with <italic>Merchants</italic> NB. As <italic>COALT</italic> purified ore with open hearth, <italic>Baring</italic> financed Kentucky coal. From this point to his death in 1893, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e DuPont\u2019s grandson Alfred DuPont became Louisville\u2019s wealthiest man through prosperous ventures including paper pulp production, city railway investments, and Kentucky coal mining.\nExpanding from Saint-Louis to the Pacific, Gould gained L&N board seats. Attempting to seize control in the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, Gould lost his seats to Cassel. So, <italic>Kuhn </italic>replaced <italic>Morgan</italic>. Moreover, Tom Ryman consolidated his packet lines as <italic>Ryman Line</italic> by 1885. Facing challenges from L&N, Ryman had to decide between engaging in a price war, converting steamboats into tugboats, or expanding upriver into territories occupied by smaller operators. \nOpting for upriver expansion intensified rivalry, resulting in fierce competition and rate reductions. As rate wars eliminated tolls, Nashville grew into a processing and trade hub. As American tariffs and deflation attracted direct investment, British investors formed <italic>Alabama Coal, Iron, Land, & Colonization Co</italic> as Congregationalist <italic>Lever</italic> and other British colonists bought American assets and industrialized Alabama and Tennessee. But Southern steel was subpar. \nAfter <italic>Baring</italic> failed in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, L&N linked with <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Belmont</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and Cassel. The following year, John Morgan\u2019s nephew married Josephine Adams Perry, a Boston Brahmin descendant of Commodore Perry\u2019s brother and second cousin of <italic>Rothschild</italic> affiliate August Belmont Jr. Meanwhile, <italic>Richmond</italic> RR consolidated to survive. Since Congress designed IA1887 against rate wars, but ICC allowed L&N low rates at Nashville due to steamboat competition. \nThe first AA1890 case was Tennessee\u2019s district attorney against L&N\u2019s coal pool. As the case ended without appeal, a produce case failed. While L&N grew, the insolvent <italic>Richmond</italic><italic> </italic>RR, <italic>East Tennessee, Virginia</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> & Georgia</italic> RR, and Georgia\u2019s <italic>Central </italic>RR<italic> & Banking Co </italic>asked <italic>Morgan</italic> for a reorg in 1892. Within two years, <italic>Morgan</italic> fused them into <italic>SOUTH </italic>RR to compete with L&N, <italic>Atlantic Coast</italic>, and <italic>Norfolk & Western</italic>.  While Watson Dickerman led the latter and served as President of NYSE, leaving his old firm <italic>Dominick Dickerman</italic>, which reorganized into <italic>Dominick</italic> with the addition of new cousin partners, including one whose extended cousin-in-law, Nelson Aldrich, became Senator of Rhode Island.\nAfter <italic>Morgan</italic> rescued <italic>COALA</italic> in 1886, teaching John Morgan to firmly establish firms before returning control to shareholders, the Court weakened IA1887\u2019s cartel control. <italic>COALA</italic>\u2019s collapse set off the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, leading <italic>Morgan</italic> to retake control. Through 1896, he dominated reorgs using interlocked directorates and <italic>Wabash</italic>-style receiverships, and stabilizing coal and roads with an anthracite cartel. He yielded UPR\u2014along with <italic>Western Union</italic>\u2014to Edward Harriman who was backed by<italic> Kuhn</italic> and Boston\u2019s <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic>, later replaced by <italic>Citi</italic> NB. \nHarriman\u2019s father was an Anglican New Jersey reverend, whose brother, dry goods merchant Oliver Harriman had married into the Midwest Tracy family, unrelated to John Morgan\u2019s wife. His wife\u2019s second cousin was Charles Tracy. Born in Saint-Louis, Missouri, in 1822, Tracy held several military positions, including post trader and sutler, notably serving as the sole trader at Fort Dodge, Kansas. Since Tracy became one of Saint-Louis\u2019 wealthiest citizens, his son became a stockbroker with <italic>McNair Tracy</italic>. \nAfter his sisters married a <italic>Brown</italic> FX broker in 1866 and a Rensselaer railroad investor in 1871, Edward left <italic>Trinity School</italic> to become a Wall Street office boy, earning enough by his early twenties to buy a NYSE seat and marrying Mary Averell, the daughter of a banker leading a small railroad in 1879 as his uncle Oliver\u2019s daughters married a <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> heir and <italic>Prime</italic> cousin Samuel Sands Jr by 1880. While Sands\u2019 mother was born to <italic>Aymer</italic> commissions merchants, his sister married a <italic>Lorillard</italic> tobacco heir. \nLikewise, Cassel and <italic>Kuhn</italic> reorganized <italic>New York, Pennsylvania, & Ohio RR</italic>, which <italic>Erie</italic> RR continued leasing. After UPR convinced the Court to restore <italic>Munn</italic> for <italic>commerce</italic> for the public interest in 1898, the Court allowed <italic>SOUTH</italic> and <italic>L&N</italic> railroads to pool cotton without trusts. The panic allowed <italic>OIL</italic> to buy distribution pipes<italic>,</italic> but her market share fell. \nAs Indonesia, Romania, Mexico, Texas, and California drilled, oil prices deflated against coal. AA1890 offered <italic>OIL</italic> respite after Texas blocked them in 1889, before the state\u2019s first oil field in 1895. Without <italic>OIL</italic>, common law \u2018right of capture\u2019 allowed only top-soil oil ownership. In racing for the common sub-soil pool, drillers pushed prices down. While flaring gas to limit production, Texas prohibited the waste in 1899. \nSince Charles Stillman helped develop Texas from 1837, his Texas-born son James moved to New York after the Civil War and became a cotton trader. After joining <italic>Citi</italic> NB\u2019s board in 1884, James Stillman added William Rockefeller, and they took charge of the bank in 1891 upon the resignation of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s President. He soon served on the boards of <italic>US Trust Co</italic>, <italic>Farmers</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Loan & Trust</italic>, <italic>New York Security & Trust</italic>, <italic>Hanover</italic> NB, <italic>Delaware</italic><italic>,</italic> <italic>Lackawanna & Western</italic> RR, <italic>Chicago & Northwestern</italic> RR, <italic>Northern Pacific</italic> RR, <italic>Consolidated Gas</italic>, and <italic>Queen Insurance Co</italic>. By 1895, one of Rockefeller\u2019s sons married James Stillman\u2019s daughter. \nAlso in 1891, the daughter of <italic>OIL</italic> co-founder Oliver Burr Jennings married Hugh Auchincloss. While Auchincloss\u2019 Scottish-born grandfather had immigrated to America in the early 1800s and later became President of <italic>American Wholesale Dry Goods Association</italic> out of New York, his father was a director of <italic>Illinois Central</italic> RR and a trustee of <italic>Mutual</italic> LIC, <italic>National Safe Deposit Co</italic> and other institutions. \nHugh served is President of <italic>Port Inglis Terminal Co</italic>, Treasurer of <italic>Dunnellon Phosphate Co</italic>, Trustee of <italic>Bowery Savings Bank</italic>, and Director of <italic>Florida Manufacturing Co</italic>, <italic>Barker Chemical Co</italic>, <italic>Newport & Wickford Steamboat & RR Co</italic>, <italic>Manhattan</italic><italic> Co Bank</italic>, <italic>Consolidated Gas</italic>, and <italic>Farmers</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Loan & Trust</italic>. The family also kinterlinked with other merchants. Hugh Auchincloss\u2019 grandson kinterlinked with future-<italic>Davis Polk</italic>\u2019s Howland cousin Russell. After his niece married <italic>Riggs</italic> cousin Richard Colgate of <italic>Colgate</italic> soap and dental creams in 1885, another niece married Henry Truslow, an extended cousin of John Thayer, involved in banking and cork manufacturing.\nIn 1895, John D Rockefeller\u2019s daughter married the son of reaper innovator Cyrus McCormick, becoming in-laws with Chicago banking Blair and Mitchell families. Other Chicago magnates, however, married within the industry, such as Protestant Helen Swift and Jewish Edward Morris meatpacker heirs in 1891. By then, Chicago had grown into America\u2019s second largest money market, trailing only New York.\nHaving helped bring down the old <italic>Tammany Hall</italic>, Randolph Guggenheimer took control of the family law firm, <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> and allied with New York\u2019s new Democratic Party, securing civic positions from 1887. Guggenheimer added his half-brothers to the firm. From 1888, Isaac and Samuel Untermyer promoted <italic>Pillsbury</italic> and other American companies in London, utilizing the press to garner attention. <italic>Blatchford </italic><italic>Seward DaCosta</italic> followed soon after. However, the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic> ended this practice, and after adding Jacob Schiff-affiliated brother-in-law Louis Marshall and other strategic marriages, <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> shifted to trusts<italic> </italic>attracting theater owners, manufacturers, and <italic>COPPER</italic>.\nSince the 1870s, New Jersey tried to shift property taxes to railroads. From 1888, the state liberalized incorporation law to increase revenues. After allowing corporations to become HCs in 1890, they raised merger intangibles after the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>. While railroads dominated capital and money markets, New Jersey\u2019s decision eased industrial financing. \nAlthough reorganizing railroads had long compelled junior creditors to accept non-voting stock, industrials issued preferred stock. Barbed wire was one such new industry. Invented in 1873, five firms protected by a patent pool dominated the industry by 1876. John Gates became the leader of patent-less barbed wire manufacturers as production and prices whiplashed. Barb\u2014refined from steel\u2014formed a pool after the <italic>Panic of 1873 </italic>to share patents and curb ruinous competition. But barb prices collapsed by 1881 and after patents expired in 1891, fell further as barb, nail, and smooth wire pools failed. As Carnegie faced strikes, Gates fused with barb competitors and\u2014as TA1894 retained coal, steel, and barb tariffs\u2014prices increased. \nAfter pipe manufacturers conspired to geographically limit competition from New Orleans to Omaha in 1894, the cartel\u2019s stenographer tried to blackmail them and alerted the municipal customers to split damages. In early 1898, the Court interpreted AA1890 to prohibit cartel pools but permit asset mergers. So, the pipe manufacturers merged into <italic>PIPE</italic>, a New Jersey HC. Following the biscuit prices wars of the <italic>Panic of 1896</italic>, <italic>Moore</italic>\u2019s <italic>New York Biscuit</italic>, Adolphus Green\u2019s <italic>American Biscuit</italic>, and another bakery trust merged into what became <italic>Nabisco</italic> HC in New Jersey by 1898. \nLikewise, <italic>Seligman</italic> and DosPassos formed <italic>THREAD</italic> to monopolize American and British sewers, with a goal to extend to Belgium and Germany. Medium-sized firms New Jersey charters to consolidate via mergers, and larger HCs from 1899. Among other benefits, the mergers turned fixed assets into liquid wealth. More than industrialists, financiers facilitated mergers with Charles Flint, DosPassos, <italic>Moore</italic>, and <italic>Schley</italic> holding about 40% of the merger market share, with <italic>Morgan</italic> holding another 10%. \n<italic>Schley</italic> had organized in 1885. Clerking with for express money transfer operations since 1861, Grand Schley joined <italic>Morgan</italic>-affiliated<italic> First </italic>NB <italic>of New York</italic> as clerk in 1874 under the leadership of George Baker, he married Baker\u2019s daughter in 1879, and then left to form a brokerage. By 1885, <italic>Schley</italic> reorganized and added George Godfrey of Maine\u2014who parlayed lumber government contracting during the <italic>Civil War</italic> to co-found <italic>American Union Telegraph</italic> and <italic>Mutual Union Telegraph</italic>, which he then leased to <italic>Morgan</italic> affiliated <italic>Western Union</italic><italic>\u2014</italic>and Elverton Chapman, a son of a reverend from Freedonia, New York.\nIn 1889, <italic>OIL</italic> incorporated there to expand nationally. <italic>OIL</italic> interests were particularly active. After William Elkins sold out his <italic>OIL</italic> partnership, he partnered with Peter Widener to promote PUs. Along with financing OIL\u2019s <italic>GAS</italic>, they formed electric street railways in Philadelphia and Brooklyn with legal advice from <italic>Blatchford </italic><italic>Seward DaCosta</italic> in 1897. <italic>Blatchford </italic><italic>Seward DaCosta</italic> also represented a syndicate led by <italic>Harriman</italic>, <italic>Seligman</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Belmont</italic>, Robert Fleming, Sidney Webster, <italic>Vermilye</italic>, and William Vanderbilt to acquire securities of <italic>Kings County Traction Co</italic>, <italic>Atlantic Avenue </italic>RR, and <italic>Brooklyn, Bath & West End</italic> RR to form <italic>Nassau Electric </italic>RR. By 1898, <italic>Kuhn</italic> heir Felix Gernsheim and an Avery extended cousin of John Rockefeller joined <italic>Blatchford Seward DaCosta</italic>, but remained only briefly.\nStreet cars received another boost from <italic>OIL</italic> heir William Whitney. Since 1884, Whitney funded Grover Cleveland\u2019s presidential campaign and became Navy in 1885. But as horses gave way to electric streetcars, Whitney returned to New York in 1889, and formed <italic>Metropolitan </italic>streetcar<italic> </italic>HC to replace disjointed lines system with generous transfers and extended runs. After Whitney married Oliver Payne\u2019s daughter in 1869, their daughter wed the son of a Churchill-Spencer descended British lord in 1895, and his son married Cornelius Vanderbilt\u2019s granddaughter by 1896. \nThe same year, August Belmont Sr\u2019s son Oliver married a former-wife of William Vanderbilt. (After August Belmont Sr died in 1900, his son, August Jr, became head of <italic>Belmont</italic>.) To compete with British interests, James Duke and Thomas Ryan promoted American <italic>TOBACCO</italic> from 1898 along with <italic>Schley</italic>, <italic>Moore</italic>, Payne,<italic> </italic>Widener, Anthony Brady, and others. \nAlongside, <italic>Lehman</italic> helped found <italic>Trust Co of America</italic> in 1899, where Emanuel and Philip Lehman joined Frank Gould, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s George Blumenthal, Montana\u2019s copper magnate who became the state\u2019s senator, and others on the board. While Henry Guggenheim Morgenthanu founding <italic>Central Realty Bond & Trust </italic>to develop New York City real estate from 1899, his brother Max soon converted <italic>Hudson Realty Co</italic><italic> </italic>from an S&L to invest in securities.\nAfter the <italic>Spanish-American War</italic>, <italic>Seligman</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic> again helped finance <italic>Panama Canal </italic>and payments to France. (<italic>Sullivan</italic> assisted in liquidating the old <italic>Lesseps</italic> company.) By 1900, Congress eased NB charters and increased banknote issuance profitability with the <italic>Gold Standard Act</italic>. However, America remained without a central bank, and the UST Secretary called a system of regional banks at the least. With the rising federalism in the growing American empire, John Morgan\u2019s daughter married Herbert Satterlee, whose second cousin was consecrated first Bishop of Washington in 1896.\nEarlier, after Maine\u2019s bumper ice harvest collapsed the ice trade in 1891, Charles Morse\u2014unrelated to Samuel\u2014formed an HC to consolidate Eastern ice and bought New York banks before incorporating <italic>ICE</italic> in 1899. After New York City officials secretly sold <italic>ICE</italic> monopoly privileges to the city docks, <italic>ICE</italic> doubled prices in 1900. Morse abandoned <italic>ICE</italic> rather than testify in court, so Governor Theodore Roosevelt dismissed the case against the Mayor. While <italic>ICE</italic> collapsed, Morse used his profits to consolidate coastal shipping. Mining Pennsylvania coal and Michigan iron, <italic>COALH</italic> fleets shipped across the Great Lakes by 1885. By 1896, Marcus Hanna represented Ohio in the Senate and soon engineered McKinley\u2019s rise to the presidency with Roosevelt as his VP by 1900. While silver magnate William Hearst\u2019s newspapers supported pro-silver Democrat William Jennings Bryan, they switched to opposing President McKinley afterward. \nOne of Hanna\u2019s competitors was Edward Breitung<italic>.</italic> Born in German Schalkau, Breitung arrived in America in 1849, and settled in Marquette, Michigan. He entered the mining industry in 1864, opened <italic>Republic Mine</italic> in 1871, began developing the Menominee Range in 1873, and partnered with Charlemagne Tower\u2019s <italic>Minnesota Iron Co</italic> in the Vermillion Range in 1882. Breitung\u2019s son, Edward Jr, became director of <italic>Negaunee Iron Co</italic>, <italic>Arctic Iron Co</italic>, <italic>Wolverine Copper & Silver Co</italic>, and <italic>Marquette Savings Bank</italic>, affiliated with Samuel Kaufman, whose daughter he married in 1890. \nKaufman\u2019s wife descended from Dutch Knickerbockers and Flemish Coyman cousins of the Medici. Samuel\u2019s son Nathan had entered mining in 1883 after selling a retail business, developed the Blue Mine in 1885, and managed the Breitung estate from 1888 to 1892. He married Edward Sr\u2019s widow in 1893, held executive roles in <italic>Washington Iron Mining Co</italic> and <italic>Negaunee Iron</italic>, and became President of <italic>Marquette Savings</italic>. \nNathan\u2019s brother Louis completed high school, shoveled iron ore, managed a gold mine in California, and ran an iron mine in Michigan. In 1891, he joined <italic>Marquette Savings </italic>as a messenger, becoming cashier and manager by 1898. Two years later, he married the daughter of German Elberfeld-born Otto Jung. Immigrating to America, Jung built a wholesale jewelry business and became co-owner and of one of the largest department stores before funding the World\u2019s Fair and serving as a director of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic> from 1900. The following year, Louis joined <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Marquette</italic> as VP in 1901, and was elected President in 1906.\nMeanwhile, since James Scrymser married a <italic>Prime</italic> descendant and started <italic>International Ocean Telegraph </italic>as the first cable to Latin America in 1866 and <italic>Erlanger</italic> banked a trans-Atlantic French cable to connect Brest to the Saint-Lawrence River in 1869, Pender\u2019s British <italic>Imperial</italic> gained control of the latter during the <italic>Panic of </italic>1873 and Jay Gould seized <italic>International Ocean Telegraph </italic>in 1878. \nWhile Scrymser turned to <italic>Morgan</italic> to form<italic> Mexican Telegraph </italic>and <italic>Central & South American Telegraph </italic>later, Gould gained control of <italic>Western Union</italic> by 1881<italic>. Siemens</italic> laid another trans-Atlantic cable by 1879. So did, Irish-born silver miner and <italic>Bank of Nevada of San Francisco</italic> founder, John Mackay, after 1883. By 1886 Mackay\u2019s <italic>Commercial Cable </italic>fought Gould\u2019s <italic>Western Union</italic> monopoly on land.  \nAfter August Belmont Sr\u2019s partner married Leonard Jerome a British Churchill-Spencer in 1874, Jerome\u2019s niece Ellen Travers married Alex King Duer, a <italic>Prime</italic> cousin and William Duer\u2019s great-grandson in 1879. While Edward Harriman\u2019s cousin Anne Harriman married <italic>Prime</italic> cousin Samuel Sands Jr in 1880, Sands died in 1889. Before Sands\u2019 sister married a <italic>SUGAR</italic> heir Theo Havemeyer in 1893, Ellen Travers Duer\u2019s brother married Anne Harriman\u2019s sister Lille in 1890. \nLikewise,  <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings Bank</italic> in Chicago President John Mitchell married <italic>Prime</italic> cousin in 1890, <italic>Prime</italic> cousin Pierson Hamilton married John Morgan\u2019s daughter and became a partner of <italic>Morgan</italic> by 1895. Since Whitney married Oliver Payne\u2019s daughter in 1869, their daughter wed the son of a Churchill-Spencer descended British lord in 1895, and his son married Cornelius Vanderbilt\u2019s granddaughter around 1896. \nBy 1897, Ellen Travers Duer\u2019s niece married <italic>Speyer</italic> New York\u2019s James Speyer and her daughter wed the son of <italic>Commercial Cable</italic>\u2019s John Mackay, Clarence. In 1901, Alex King Duer\u2019s cousin once removed married a son of Clement Griscom\u2014a Philadelphia shipper as well as a director of <italic>PENN</italic> and <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s largest pipe, descended from Thomas Lloyd and a Biddle in-law\u2014combined trans-Atlantic shipping into <italic>International Mercantile Marine </italic>(\u201c<italic>SHIP</italic>\u201d) with <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>soon after.\nBy then, <italic>Roosevelt</italic>\u2019s James-Alfred Roosevelt had joined the boards of <italic>Central & South American Telegraph</italic>, <italic>Chemical </italic>NB, and others. At his death in 1898, his son William inherited head of <italic>Roosevelt</italic> and <italic>Broadway Improvement</italic>, and the directorships of <italic>Chemical</italic>, <italic>Astor</italic>, <italic>Gallatin</italic>, <italic>Central Hanover</italic>, and <italic>Bank of New York</italic>.As James-Alfred\u2019s cousin Theodore Roosevelt became President after America expanded across the Pacific Ocean with the <italic>Spanish America War</italic>, he stipulated the cable company should be American without foreign connections. \nDespite a lack of federal subsidies and opposition from Scrymser, Mackay began building a trans-Pacific cable in 1902 and reached the Philippines by 1904. Although John Pender\u2019s British international telegraphy monopoly likewise forbade a connection with Mackay and did not have a trans-Pacific connection, they secretly cooperated. Since his former wife married Oliver Belmont in 1896, William H Vanderbilt married Samuel Sands Jr\u2019s widow Anne Harriman in 1903. As Anne\u2019s sister Lille divorced William Travers Jr in 1905, Travers committed suicide, and Lille married <italic>SUGAR</italic> heir Frederick Havemeyer by 1906.\nAs <italic>OIL</italic> acquired <italic>Guggenheim</italic>-funded <italic>Imperial Oil </italic>of Canadian, the Seligman-in-laws refused to sell out to <italic>OIL</italic>, <italic>Lewisohn</italic>, and <italic>Schley</italic> in <italic>SMELTER</italic> in 1899. Under heavy pressure to reach an agreement, <italic>Guggenheim</italic> gained control of <italic>SMELTER.</italic> Marriages accompanied the mergers with <italic>Seligman</italic> London senior partner married Katz-descendant <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>-heiress Eva Merton since <italic>Cohen-Barent</italic><italic> Rothschild </italic>incorporated<italic> Metallgesellschaft</italic> in 1881. \nSince joining <italic>Metallgesellschaft </italic>in America in 1892, Carl Loeb\u2014from outside of Frankfurt, but not related to <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Loeb\u2014married in 1902 Adeline Moses of Alabama, the daughter of the head of the South\u2019s prominent merchant banking Jewish family and a <italic>Lehman</italic> friend. By then, <italic>PLATINUM</italic>\u2019s Engelhard bought firms to control 90% of America\u2019s platinum. For decades after, <italic>SMELTER</italic> was one of America\u2019s few metal refiners for decades, with interests in international miners such as <italic>Kennecott</italic>, <italic>Calumet</italic>, and <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>.\nPlatinum competition increased as Russia allowed foreign investment. By 1899, French bankers monopolized Russia\u2019s <italic>Demidov</italic> platinum. So, <italic>PLATINUM</italic> refocused on America. Like in other industries, previous attempts to control brass prices and production through agreements failed due to competition and evasion. In 1899, enterprises owned by <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> and other capitalists consolidated to form <italic>BRASS</italic> to stabilize a competitive and volatile market, which came to control two-thirds of American brass production and a third of the nation\u2019s copper consumption.\nWith <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> as counsel, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, Cassel, <italic>Lewisohn</italic>, and others cartelized global copper into <italic>COPPER</italic>, issuing shares through Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Citi</italic>, with <italic>Lewisohn </italic>organizing a syndicate for distributing the stock in Europe including <italic>Ladenburg</italic> <italic>Thalmann</italic>\u2019s long-term partner<italic> Schr\u00f6der</italic>. Adolph Lewisohn\u2019s nephew married Randolph Guggenheimer\u2019s daughter in 1899. <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> became legal counsel for Guggenheim, Lewisohn, and <italic>New York Times</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> Ochs. \nUsing media to spread promote securities, <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> hired non-Jewish partners from 1900, leading to new clients including British promoter Whittaker Wright, Caleb Hamm (<italic>New York World</italic>\u2019s Managing Editor sued by President Theodore Roosevelt), James Hyde\u2019s <italic>Equitable </italic>LIC, William Hearst, <italic>Encyclopedia Britannica</italic>\u2019s Horace Hooper, <italic>Imperial Tobacco </italic>of Britain, and <italic>United Fruit</italic>.\nIn 1894, copper magnate Benjamin Guggenheim married banking heiress Fleurette Seligman. As Germany consumed a third of American copper exports, <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> and other refiners thrived. Since Earl Albert Grey replaced Cecil Rhodes as Administrator of Rhodesia in 1894, Consuelo Astor married a Churchill-Spencer in 1895. Then in 1898, a Grenfell cousin<italic> </italic>partner of <italic>Morton </italic>London wed Lilian Churchill-Spencer, Earl Grey\u2019s niece married Vivian Smyth, and <italic>Standard Bank</italic> made a Smyth-in-law her Chair. While <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann </italic>represented <italic>Metallgesellshaft</italic>\u2019s American interests, Emil Ladenburg\u2019s cousins with <italic>Seligman</italic> through Goldschmidt Gans sisters in the late 1890s.\nMeanwhile, with PUs collapsing amidst the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic> and GE lent to and reorganized PUs. To appraise the value of the PUs, <italic>Morgan</italic> retained the Boston Brahmin electrical engineering consultancy <italic>Stone Webster</italic>, which was founded by a son of <italic>Kidder</italic> partner Frank Webster. Webster\u2019s co-founder and MIT classmate, Charles Stone,  was an extended cousin of the founder of <italic>Kidder</italic>\u2019s predecessor firm, <italic>Thayer</italic>, a partner of Charlemagne Tower\u2019s <italic>Minnesota Iron Co</italic>, and of Galen Stone.\nGalen Stone was a financial editor, before joining Boston broker <italic>Clark Ward</italic>, where he met Adams cousin Charles Hayden, who had graduated from MIT in 1890 with a degree in mining and electrical subjects, including copper. In 1892, Stone and Hayden left to form brokerage <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>, which targeted copper from inception, using direct circulars to help copper develop American telephony and electricity in alliance with <italic>Morgan</italic>. \nAmidst evaluating and appraising electrical properties, <italic>Stone Webster</italic>\u2019s financial officer, Cameron Forbes\u2014a grandson of John Forbes and a son of AT&T\u2019s founding president\u2014aided the firm in managing and owning electrical properties. The first property acquired was <italic>Cumberland Electric Light & Power Co</italic> of Nashville, which they bought from <italic>Morgan</italic> interests in 1894 after appraising the property by the investment bankers. \nDuring the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, Alabama\u2019s coal king seized control of <italic>COALT</italic>. Although Jere Baxter built a depot to sell his steel, L&N refused service, and he failed along with Gates\u2019 pools in 1896. So, Gates bought Jere\u2019s property and kept him as manager. Likewise, <italic>Canadian Copper</italic> and other foreign companies competed to control Canadian nickel. As Americans exported raw ore, Canadians introduced taxes, license fees, and royalties to promote refining in Canada by 1897. \nGates then approached <italic>Morgan</italic> to expand beyond the barbed wire. While <italic>Morgan</italic> refused to join Gates\u2019 <italic>WIRE</italic> in 1898, he formed <italic>Federal Steel Corp</italic>. The same year, the Spanish-America War started. As a result, consumers ran to buy processed metal ahead of price hikes. And by subjecting pools to AA1890 in 1899, the Court promoted asset mergers, with <italic>Moore</italic> promoting <italic>TIN</italic>, <italic>National Steel</italic>, <italic>American Sheet Steel Co</italic>, and <italic>American Steel Hoop</italic>. He failed in a hostile takeover of <italic>Carnegie</italic>.\nAs <italic>Carnegie</italic> threatened to link with Jay Gould\u2019s son unless he received rebates, he disturbed the British steel cartel with a large sale to a railroad. Against <italic>Carnegie</italic>, his coke dealer partnered with <italic>Mellon</italic> to form a steel firm. With coal, steel, and railroad stability in danger, John Morgan formed the world\u2019s largest HC, <italic>STEEL</italic> with support from <italic>Kidder</italic>. He forced Gates to sell <italic>WIRE</italic> without sharing a directorship. \nCombining <italic>Federal Steel</italic>, <italic>WIRE</italic>, <italic>Moore</italic>\u2019s firms, <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>\u2019s tin, <italic>Carnegie</italic>, <italic>Minnesota Iron Co</italic>, and much of <italic>COALB</italic> and <italic>Hanna</italic>, <italic>STEEL</italic> floated shares in America and Europe, with <italic>Ladenburg</italic> <italic>Thalmann</italic> leading the syndicate including <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>. As the RHC stabilized prices and led safety standards, Morgan banished Gates from Wall Street, who still retained interests in Texan railroads and parlayed his winnings from <italic>WIRE </italic>into Texan oil to start <italic>Texaco</italic>.\nWithin a year, <italic>Morgan</italic> united Canadian copper and nickel miners into <italic>NICKEL</italic>. To prevent vertical integrating and rate wars, <italic>Morgan</italic> aggregated <italic>McCormick</italic>, <italic>Deering</italic>, and three other farm equipment manufactures into <italic>HARVESTER</italic>. Similarly, he consolidated Atlantic-crossing steamships into the <italic>International Mercantile Marine </italic>(\u201c<italic>SHIP</italic>\u201d), including the future <italic>Titanic</italic>. From <italic>STEEL</italic> to <italic>HARVESTER</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s lawyer was Francis Stetson of future-<italic>Davis Polk</italic>. As head of Belfast-based firm <italic>Harland Wolff</italic>, Irishman William Pirrie constructed iconic ships. Since <italic>Harland Wolff</italic> held liner shares, Pirrie facilitated in forming <italic>SHIP</italic>. \nAfter  daughter of American architect Samuel Warner\u2014an extended cousin of the Stone family and an in-law of the Porges family\u2014wed a Baltazzi cousin in New York in 1897, another Baltazzi married a Haber L\u00e4mel cousin in Vienna by 1898, thus linking the Stones, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, and <italic>Credianstalt</italic>. Extended cousins of the Stone and Hayden families, Helen Osborne, a granddaughter of prominent Mott abolitionists, married lawyer James Perry Storrow back in 1891. \nWhile his father was <italic>Bell</italic>\u2019s patent lawyer and related to the Lee, Cabot, and Higginson families, Storrow\u2019s mother was a great niece of Commodore Perry, connecting him to <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Belmont</italic>. <italic>Calumet Copper Mining</italic>\u2019s<italic> Lee</italic> hired Storrow in 1900. Through the Quaker Macy family, the Motts were also extended cousins of Charles Coffin, President of <italic>Thomson Houston</italic>, which merged into Edison\u2019s GE, with Coffin as President.  \nLikewise, Osborne\u2019s second cousin Lucretia Mott, also a cousin-in-law of Arizona copper magnates <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> through her father, was John Morgan\u2019s extended cousin and descendant of Rhode Island\u2019s colonial governor through her mother. By 1896, Lucretia married Albert Strauss. Along with his brother Frederick, Strauss was born in New York to a Jewish Bavarian immigrant from near where Levi Strauss\u2019 family originated. Frederick  had joined <italic>Seligman</italic> as a clerk in 1886. By 1901, <italic>Seligman</italic> named the Strausses the first non-family partners and Albert Seligman of San Francisco soon led <italic>Butte Copper</italic>.Another Mott cousin, Caro Noyes, married a <italic>Brown</italic> heir in 1904.\nWhile Heinze sold copper out of Butte, Montana, in <italic>Lewisohn</italic>\u2019s Boston market, he bribed judges. So, <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Kidder</italic> joined <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s <italic>Citi</italic> NB and grew <italic>COPPER</italic>. <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Schiff joined <italic>Citi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s board by 1899. While many of the Russia\u2019s new listed companies were French funded, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, and <italic>Hambro</italic> founded a venture to amalgamate Australian mines and buy Russian copper mines. \nBy December 1899, the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic> stuck America. <italic>Globe</italic> NB of Boston, weakened by loans on <italic>United States Oil</italic> and <italic>United Mining</italic> securities, received $3,500,000 from <italic>Boston Clearing House</italic> but later closed. The failure of pork packer <italic>Squire</italic> led to the suspension of <italic>Broadway</italic> NB. In New York, <italic>Produce Exchange Trust</italic> and <italic>Allen</italic> suspended, call money rose to 186%, and <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Central Trust</italic>, and nine NYCH banks advanced $11 million while UST directed revenue deposits to remain in banks. The next day NYCH offered $10 million, of which half was taken, and call rates fell to 6%.\nDuring the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic>, <italic>COPPER</italic> supported prices. Having failed in the 1895, the global aluminum cartel likewise expanded to fix prices after the crisis. <italic>ALUM</italic> incorporated via a Canadian subsidiary to join. As Montana led states in judicial reform, Heinze sold most mines to<italic> COPPER</italic>, creating <italic>United Copper</italic> with the rest. Since forming <italic>COPPER</italic>, <italic>Untermyer</italic> counseled the merger. By 1901, Lewisohn kinterlinked with Lehman. \nAs <italic>Morton </italic>London dissolved following the <italic>Baring</italic> failure, Arthur Grenfell partnered with his extended cousin Ernest Chapin to form <italic>Chapin</italic> <italic>Grenfell</italic>, while <italic>Morgan</italic> promoted his cousin Walter Spencer Morgan Burns to partner and hired Arthur\u2019s cousin Edward Grenfell as his agent. In 1901, Arthur Grenfell married Earl Grey\u2019s daughter and joined the boards of several African mining ventures as well as <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>. (Likewise, three Grey and Baring cousins wed Grenfells, diversifying their <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Glyn </italic>links.) \nAmidst the boom, John Morgan, James Stillman, Jacob Schiff, James Blair, Edward Harriman, Marshall Field, and other Midwestern investors oversaw the absorption of Chicago\u2019s <italic>Union</italic> NB into <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic> to become the 5th largest in the country by 1900 under the leadership of James Forgan. \nForgan was born in Saint-Andrews, Scotland, to a golf club and ball maker. He was steered into banking by an uncle who was the local agent for <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic>, which he entered for three years before joining <italic>Bank of British North America</italic> in London, Montreal, New York, and Halifax. He later left for <italic>Bank of Nova Scotia</italic>, which he branched to Minneapolis in 1885, and in 1888 became Cashier of <italic>Northwestern </italic>NB <italic>of Minneapolis</italic>, before becoming VP of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic> in 1892 under Lyman Gage, who was appointed Secretary of UST in 1900. \nForgan\u2019s brother David joined <italic>Clydesdale Bank</italic>, emigrated to Halifax in 1880, worked for <italic>Bank of Nova Scotia</italic> in Fredericton, becoming Cashier at <italic>Northwestern </italic>NB <italic>of Minneapolis</italic> in 1890, and President of <italic>Union</italic> NB in 1898. David became SVP of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic> after the 1900 merger. Likewise, James\u2019 son Robert worked at <italic>Union</italic> NB in 1895 and <italic>Bank of Nova Scotia</italic> until joining <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic> in 1900.\nWith<italic> </italic>international ambitions, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>Chicago</italic> promoted a German Jew. Possibly born to the May family related to Oppenheim, Fuld, and Lazard, Max May of Darmstadt trained at <italic>May</italic> Mannheim and other banks before immigrating to America in 1883 and became a citizen in 1888. Likely marrying a cousin of Henry Greenbaum, he worked at <italic>Union</italic> and <italic>Atlas</italic> NBs of Chicago before <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>Chicago</italic>.\nMonths after investing in <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic>, Henry Porter, a son of the former Chair of <italic>Chicago & Eastern Illinois</italic> RR, and a founder of <italic>STEEL</italic>, married Mary Isham Prentice\u2014a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne Elder Strong\u2019s brother-in-law, and Reverand Pierpont. Making  her John Morgan\u2019s third cousin once removed. While her father had been counsel to <italic>Illinois Steel</italic>, her second cousin once removed, William Isham, was connected to the leather trade and a VP of New York\u2019s <italic>Bank of Metropolis</italic>, in which <italic>Citi</italic> acquired a controlling stake in 1900. Another first cousin once removed married a sister of <italic>Morgan</italic> allied banker William Sheldon. Also in 1901, Mary\u2019s brother married John Rockefeller\u2019s daughter.\nWith a heritage tracing back to 12th century Scotland, the Blair family engaged in preaching, teaching, and landownership in America from the early 18th century. A grandson of New Jersey\u2019s John-Insley Blair, James Blair worked at <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Tiffin</italic> before founding investment bank <italic>Blair</italic><italic> </italic>in New York. (Among <italic>Blair</italic>\u2019s long term-partners was Thomas Ryan\u2019s son John.) Meanwhile, James Blair\u2019s extended cousin Chauncey Blair kinterlinked his brother with reaper innovator Cyrus McCormick\u2019s niece in 1882 and his son, Chauncey-Justus Blair, with a daughter of American-born Scot William Mitchell in 1883. \nHaving built <italic>Alton</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Louis</italic> RR, and helped organize <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Alton</italic>, Mitchell co-founded <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings Bank</italic> in Chicago in 1873, which raised investment from <italic>Armour</italic> and <italic>Marshall Field</italic> interests during the <italic>Panic</italic><italic> </italic><italic>of 1876</italic>, and his son presided from 1880 and married an extended <italic>Prime</italic> cousin. By 1888, Chauncey-Justus became President of <italic>Merchants</italic> NB of Chicago in 1888, the competing<italic> Corn Exchange</italic> NB successively absorbed <italic>Northwestern</italic> NB and <italic>American</italic> NB before merging with <italic>Merchants</italic> NB in 1902, shortly after John D Rockefeller\u2019s daughter married Cyrus McCormick\u2019s son. While Chauncey-Justus retired from active involvement, he served as a VP of <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>. \nNorman Harris, born in Massachusetts, descended from Emperor Charlemagne and Puritan colonists, Norman started his business career at 18 as a soliciting agent for a LIC in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1867, he organized <italic>Union Central</italic> LIC. After marrying a descendant of a signer of the <italic>Declaration of the Independence</italic> in 1879, Harris formed the Chicago private bank <italic>Harris</italic> in 1881, focusing on municipal bonds. \nBy 1891, <italic>Harris</italic> hired Cleveland-born Boyd Forbes, but a graduate of <italic>Northwestern</italic> <italic>Uni</italic> and <italic>Yale</italic> Law who briefly worked <italic>Swift</italic>\u2019s legal department in Chicago, made partner at <italic>Harris</italic> in 1899 (without a close relation of <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s Forbes.) Relocating to New York in 1901, Forbes oversaw that office. Leaving <italic>Harris</italic>, Noah Halsey established New York<italic> </italic>private bank <italic>Halsey</italic> in 1901. Two years later, he poached <italic>Harris</italic>\u2019 Harold Stuart, a descendant of James IV of Scotland, to manage the new <italic>Halsey</italic> Chicago. Like <italic>Harris</italic>, <italic>Halsey</italic> focused on municipal bonds, and in the east, railroads.\nBy 1896, a group of Massachusetts savings banks, faced with declining market values and dividends on their legally limited investments, appointed a committee to address the situation. After nearly two years of deliberations, they concluded that there was excessive capital invested in NBs and decided to act. The solution involved consolidating ten NBs into Boston\u2019s largest bank. In 1898, <italic>Kidder</italic> led a syndicate of 27 underwriters, including <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>McCormick</italic>, <italic>Moseley</italic>, and <italic>Baring Magoun</italic> of New York, to consolidate the banks into <italic>Shawmut</italic> NB. \nLikewise, <italic>Harris</italic> hired John Macomber. With Scottish roots, the son of a hardware merchant of Framingham, Massachusetts, he started as a messenger in 1894, and after graduating MIT in 1897, was admitted to the firm in 1909. Also in Boston, a descendant of <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s John Forbes, Allan Forbes graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1897, Forbes briefly worked in banking before becoming Assistant Treasurer of <italic>State Street Trust </italic>in 1899, a small 8-year-old bank. And as <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> acquired <italic>Massachusetts </italic>NB in 1903, the bank, along with the affiliated <italic>Shawmut</italic> NB and <italic>Old Colony</italic><italic> Trust</italic>\u2014controlled half of Boston\u2019s deposits.\nAs the dominant Boston Brahmin banks kinterlinked\u2014with <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic>\u2019s Thomas Coolidge niece married the nephew of <italic>Lee</italic>\u2019s Henry Lee Higginson\u2019s nephew in 1905\u2014<italic>Lee </italic>branched to other cities, and replaced <italic>Speyer </italic>as her<italic> </italic>London bank with<italic> Morgan</italic>. While Thomas Jefferson\u2019s descendant Coolidge founded <italic>Old Colony</italic> and was a second cousin once removed of <italic>Morgan</italic> partner George Bowdin and fourth cousin of Morgan\u2019s son-in-law Pierson Hamilton, both descendants of inaugural UST Secretary Alex Hamilton, he hired former President James Polk\u2019s second cousin thrive removed as a clerk. Likewise, <italic>White Weld</italic> hired President Taft\u2019s nephew. \nNew York was no different. Since the Patroon Rensselaer co-founded and led <italic>Bank of Albany</italic>, <italic>Albany Savings Bank</italic>, and <italic>Merchants</italic>\u2019 NB <italic>of Albany</italic>, William Rensselaer became President of <italic>Albany Savings Bank</italic> in 1900, during which time it became the largest financial institution in the city. While <italic>Ohio Life Insurance & Trust</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>George Coe presided over <italic>American Exchange </italic>NB from 1860 until 1894, he was succeeded by long-time deputy Dumont Clarke, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, Henry I of England, and an early governor of Rhode Island colony, and sixth generation bank president following <italic>Bank of Rhode Island</italic> co-founders from 1795. Since the daughter of American speculator Leonard Jerome married a Churchill-Spencer in 1874, Consuelo Astor married another Churchill-Spencer in 1895. Likewise, Morgan, Vanderbilt, and other heiresses married into the aristocracy, sending American investments to Europe through doweries. \n<italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> of New York started by 1891, with a Board Directors including George Baker, August Belmont, Edward Harriman, Levi Morton, Alex Orr, and Frederick Vanderbilt. Edwin Packard served as President until 1894, when Walter Oakman  took over. Born to a prominent Philadelphia merchant, Oakman graduated from <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> in 1864. After gaining technical experience at <italic>Rogers Locomotive Works</italic> and <italic>Delaware, Lackawanna & Western </italic>RR as division superintendent in 1877, he became VP of <italic>Central</italic> RR of New Jersey and then President of <italic>Richmond & Danville</italic> RR until 1894. Oakman then became President of <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> of New York until 1900. \nIn 1879, Oakman married Roscoe Conkling\u2019s daughter. A prominent Republican leader who held key roles such as district attorney of Oneida County, Mayor of Utica, and Senator for New York, Conkling had married Julia Seymour. Since <italic>Holland Land Co</italic> and Cazenove\u2019s agent Lincklaen kinterlinked with Seymour cousins Ledyard in 1792, Julia\u2019s brother, Horatio, served as New York\u2019s Governor (1853-1854, 1863-1864) and later ran for President. Her sister Helen married Ledyard Lincklaen. While a Seymour cousin married a Biddle in the 1850s, others were related to the Pomeroy Davisons. Conkling\u2019s sister wed a political second cousin of <italic>Lee</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s George Higginson and his cousin Henry Ledyard was President of <italic>Michigan Central</italic> RR in the 1880s, Charles Ledyard Fairchild was President of <italic>New York Security & Trust Co </italic>from 1891, and Lewis Cass Ledyard of New York was Oliver Payne\u2019s lawyer. <italic>Blair</italic> also descended from a Revolution-era Ledyard.\nBy the late 1890s, over 50 American heiresses married British, Italian, or French nobles. Among these, 15 women entered Parisian high society, and their combined dowries surpassed 160 million <italic>francs</italic>. Over half of this amount was attributable to Jay Gould\u2019s daughter Anna, who married French Count Boniface Castellane in 1895. While Gould had a dowery of 85 million <italic>francs</italic>, that of Winnaretta Singer, one of sewing-machine magnate Isaac Singer\u2019s 24 children, was valued at 10 million <italic>francs </italic>for the benefit of Prince Polignac. Despite being born in America, she spent most of her life in Europe with her French mother.\nIn 1904, <italic>Gibbs</italic>\u2019 Partner and brother-in-law newly elected director of BOE married Lord Romney\u2019s niece. A survey conducted between 1890 and 1914 among 460 leading bankers showed that nearly 75% were educated at public schools and <italic>Oxbridge</italic>. Over a third married into the aristocracy or gentry, and another quarter into landowners. Three-fifths of them left fortunes exceeding \u00a3100,000, and almost half maintained residences in both London and the countryside, favoring areas like Mayfair and Belgravia. <italic>Carlton Club</italic> was the most popular social club among them, reflecting their prominent status within the elite social circles of the time. \nIn this era, 35% of London bankers married daughters of the aristocracy or gentry, rising to 60% when including other elites. In France, 55% of big businessmen married within the business community, 22% married daughters of senior civil servants, and 11% married daughters of professionals. In Germany, 17% of wealthy businessmen married daughters of the aristocracy, 62% married within business families, and 17% married daughters of the educated middle class. In Westphalia, 85% of prominent businessmen with the title of Kommerzienrat married into business families. These social customs intertwined with law. Since Napoleon\u2019s <italic>Code</italic> fragmented land hindered mining in Spain, Italy, and German countries until nationalization in the 1860s, British banks and insurers funded land owned mainly by the gentry and worked by working class male miners to export coal. \nWhile Jewish <italic>Kuhn</italic> publicly partnered with Christian Harriman and Rockefeller, John Morgan did so secretly. <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s most active broker was likely <italic>Housman</italic>. A likely cousin-in-law of K\u00f6nigswarter\u2014related to Wertheim, Oppenheim, and <italic>Kuhn </italic>partners\u2014Jewish Arthur Housman formed the mixed-religion <italic>Burrill</italic> <italic>Housman</italic> in 1885 with Protestant Roosevelt<italic>-cousin </italic>William Vermilye Burrill. As Burrill retired in 1890, Housman took over, and his sister married William Hart Cardozo of <italic>Farmers Loan & Trust</italic>. In 1891, <italic>Housman</italic> hired Bernard Baruch and his brother. \nTracing their maternal line to Sephardi shipowner Isaac Rodriguez Marques, who arrived in New York around the late 17th century, the brothers\u2019 great-grandmother, Sarah Cohen, married a South Carolina plantation owner, who lost his wealth during the <italic>Civil War</italic>. The Baruch brothers\u2019 father, Simon, was born in Germany with rabbinical and Portuguese-Spanish roots. Simon immigrated in 1855, and practiced medicine in South Carolina. After serving as a Confederate Army surgeon in General Lee\u2019s forces, Simon moved the family to New York where he chaired <italic>Columbia</italic>\u2019s hydrotherapy department. Likewise, Baruch\u2019s cousin Edgar Baruch\u2014whose father had been a Charleston banker and married to a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2014began training at <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic> by 1903.\nAlso in 1891, <italic>Housman</italic> hired Protestant Edward Pierce. By 1895, <italic>Housman</italic> reinforced <italic>Vermilye</italic> connections as Arthur Housman\u2019s sister married Harry Asher, who had co-founded <italic>New Haven Building & Loan </italic>with <italic>Vermilye </italic>partner Frederick Trowbridge. Jewish firms also hired Christians. Since <italic>Seligman</italic>\u2019s Strauss marry-partnered with Quakers in 1896, <italic>Kuhn</italic> hired Irish Baptist George Bovenizer as an office boy in 1897, and <italic>Goldman</italic> recruited New Englander William Bowers out of <italic>Harvard </italic>in 1900. \n<italic>Morgan</italic> did not have any Jewish partners before WWII or share kinship links with any Jewish bank until the 1930s (and then only through Christians). Still, Jews were vital to <italic>Morgan</italic>. In 1904, Max May left <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>Chicago</italic> to join <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> of New York, soon rising to VP and leading her FX Department. May\u2019s initiatives expanded daily transactions to $20 million and total turnovers to over $6 billion, primarily with Germany. Likewise, Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Citi</italic> retained <italic>Teixeira</italic> cousin Max Teixeira, on <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>\u2019s recommendation to establish an FX department in 1897. By 1901, Teixeira was a foreign secretary at <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Pittsburgh</italic>, where he helped develop the bank\u2019s FX department.\n<italic>Speyer</italic>\u2019s affiliate <italic>Teixeira</italic> also incorporated <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR in Amsterdam because of financial challenges after the <italic>Panic of 1896</italic>. The reorg involved <italic>Speyer</italic> New York, <italic>Speyer</italic> London, <italic>Speyer</italic> Frankfurt, and <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, before selling <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR to <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Northern Pacific</italic> RR (\u201cNPR\u201d) in 1899. <italic>Kuhn </italic>and<italic> OIL</italic>\u2019s <italic>Citi</italic> NB financed UPR to form UPRHC to acquire the <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR from NPR. By April 1901, another of Rockefeller\u2019s sons married a daughter of <italic>Citi</italic> NB\u2019s James Stillman. \nConcurrently, <italic>Great Northern</italic> RR\u2014led by James Hill and John Kendy\u2014partnered with <italic>NPR</italic> to gain control of <italic>Chicago, Burlington & Quincy</italic> RR, alarming UPR\u2019s Harriman, who then sought control of <italic>NPR</italic>. As <italic>Kuhn</italic> helped Harriman gain control NPR in May, Senior Partner Robert Bacon scrambled to communicate with John Morgan, who was sailing to Europe, in negotiating with Hill. As the two battled for control, shorts scrambled to cover positions, and stock prices soared tenfold while most other stock prices fell in the <italic>Panic of 1901</italic>. \nRumors of the death of Arthur Housman accelerated the panic, forcing his friends to bring him to NYSE\u2019s trading floor and assure traders that <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s broker was still active. Within a month, Stillman\u2019s son married a <italic>Brown</italic> heiress. Finally, <italic>Kuhn</italic> withdrew support from Harriman, aligning instead with <italic>Morgan</italic>, and the bankers called a truce in November by fusing these roads into a <italic>NTHWST</italic> RHC with legal advice from Francis Stetson of future-<italic>Davis Polk</italic>.\nFollowing the assassination of President William McKinley in September 1901, Theodore Roosevelt assumed the presidency. Like Roosevelt\u2019s family and career were closely linked to <italic>Morgan</italic>, so was his Administration.   Roosevelt inherited John Hay as Secretary of State; Hay\u2019s daughter was married to William Whitney\u2019s son, linked to John Morgan. Elihu Root, Roosevelt\u2019s friend and attorney of Whitney and John, became Secretary of State, appointing <italic>Morgan</italic> partner Robert Bacon as Assistant Secretary and later as Secretary of State in 1909. \nRoosevelt also named Paul Morton, VP of <italic>Atchison, Topeka & Santa</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Fe</italic> RR, as Secretary of the Navy, with Herbert Satterlee, John Morgan\u2019s son-in-law, as Assistant Secretary. A member of <italic>Yale</italic>\u2019s <italic>Skull & Bones Society</italic> along with Whitney and Root, Henry Stimson had joined Root\u2019s firm, which he reorganized into <italic>Winthrop Stimson</italic> in 1901. By 1911, Stimson became Secretary of War.\nFrom October 1901, Abby Aldrich, daughter of the Senator from Rhode Island, a <italic>Morgan</italic> ally and descendant of Puritan Minister Roger Williams, the founder of Providence, Rhode Island, married John Rockefeller Jr. By December, President Roosevelt called on Congress for an elastic currency and criticized overcapitalized firms. As Roosevelt ordered DOJ to sue <italic>NTHWST</italic>, investors ran from HC securities fearing anti-trust regulation. \nWhile <italic>Belmont</italic> had shorted to managed pre-delivery risk. While NYSE regulations required a waiting period to prevent fraud, clerical error offered freshly issued stock for sale before listing. But as the Gates syndicate bought L&N stock, traders ran from <italic>Belmont</italic>. Since these securities were within the waiting period, there was a risk that <italic>Belmont</italic> would collapse if they could not settle the shorts. So, they called <italic>Morgan</italic> to arbitrate. \nAlthough Gates offered to lend his shares to cover the shorts, <italic>Morgan</italic> paid him to gain control and prevent rate wars. After <italic>Morgan</italic> sold his shares L&N to <italic>Atlantic Coast</italic> RR, he became L&N\u2019s banker, and <italic>Belmont</italic> lost the chair. While considering squeezing <italic>Belmont</italic>, Gates was uninterested in a rate war. Gates wanted L&N to transport coal and steel from Alabama (and likely <italic>Texaco</italic> oil from Texas). And Birmingham had the most railroad connections of any Southern municipality at the time. As part of the deal with <italic>Morgan</italic>, Gates obtained <italic>Belmont</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s <italic>Republic Steel</italic> directorship. With the volatile MMSEC,<italic> Kuhn</italic> partner Jacob Schiff appealed to the <italic>Chamber of Commerce</italic> for financial regulation to stabilize interest rates in 1902.\nAlready controlling <italic>Erie</italic> RR and <italic>New York, Pennsylvania, & Ohio</italic> RR since 1896, <italic>Morgan</italic> stabilized anthracite by fusing Vanderbilt\u2019s assets with<italic> COALA</italic>. After <italic>PENN</italic> paid Carnegie rebates for him to avoid switching to Jay Gould\u2019s son, George, who expanded in West Virginia. So, <italic>PENN</italic> linked with <italic>Baltimore & Ohio</italic> and <italic>COALB</italic>. With the exhaustion of Pittsburg\u2019s natural gas deposits in 1899, <italic>Cabot</italic> moved to West Virginia. Few coalers joined <italic>LABOR </italic>from 1890 until 1896, when Tennessee outlawed prison labor to break strikes. Winning an eight-hour day in 1897, <italic>LABOR </italic>entered Alabama. \nAfter <italic>PENN</italic>\u2019s pension innovation in 1900, <italic>COALA</italic> and other RHCs started retirement insurance. However, Austrian coal strikes extended the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic>, spreading to Galician Boryslaw\u2019s oil industry through to industrial Russia and Germany, and deflating utilities and un-cartelized goods there and beyond. By 1902, <italic>LABOR </italic>struck, freezing New England, Congress eliminated import tariffs on anthracite. As Roosevelt did not arbitrate, <italic>Morgan</italic> negotiated an end with <italic>COALA</italic>. After the coal strike settled, Robert Bacon resigned from <italic>Morgan</italic> and served in high federal posts during his friend Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Administration, including Secretary of State, and then Ambassador to France, and Overseer of <italic>Harvard</italic>.\nUpper-class women played significant roles in social reform through settlement houses, <italic>Consumers</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> League</italic> (\u201cNCL\u201d), and <italic>Women</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Trade Union League </italic>(\u201cWTUL\u201d). In 1904, Jane Addams of <italic>Hull House</italic> and Mary McDowell of <italic>Uni Settlement</italic> mediated the stockyard strike by negotiating with Ogden Armour. Wealthy individuals such as Anita McCormick and Julius Rosenwald supported these efforts. WTUL, founded in 1903, included leaders like Margaret Dreier Robbins, who collaborated with Florence Kelley. Prominent figures involved in these reforms included Mrs. Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Mrs. Thomas Lamont, Mrs. O.H.P. Belmont, and the daughters of John Morgan, Edward Harriman, Cyrus McCormick, and Mark Hanna, showcasing the significant involvement of wealthy individuals in the Progressive movement.\nAmidst the inflation, Rockefeller started the <italic>General Education Board</italic> to fight Southern poverty using science. In Tennessee, Jere Baxter joined the state legislature to fight L&N to link his depot in 1903 but died within a year.. As <italic>STEEL</italic> joined Europe\u2019s cartel to limit international competition, Gates merged <italic>COALT</italic>\u2019s open-hearth refinement with <italic>Republic Steel</italic>\u2019s scale by partnering with <italic>Schley</italic>, <italic>TOBACCO</italic>, and <italic>Trust Co of America </italic>SB. Moreover, <italic>STEEL</italic> and <italic>COALB </italic>lost<italic> </italic>out as UPR committed to 150 kilotons with <italic>COALT </italic>by 1904. Likewise, <italic>COALH</italic> magnate and Ohio Senator Marcus Converse Hanna\u2019s daughter married Joseph McCormick, a first cousin once removed of Rockefeller\u2019s son-in-law, with President Roosevelt as a guest.\nIn lieu of financial regulation, Protestant bankers organized <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> in late 1903. The driving force was Henry Pomeroy Davison. Born in Troy, Pennsylvania, to a family of bankers and Presbyterian clergy, Davison was an extended cousin of John Davison Rockefeller. He left in 1888 to become a bookkeeper in <italic>Pequonnock</italic> NB at Bridgeport, Connecticut, catching the attention of bank director circus magnate PT Barnum and joining his weekly whist game. \nBy 1890, a Pomeroy cousin of Davisons\u2019 mother married an Avery cousin of the Rockefeller family. In 1891, he joined <italic>Astor Trust</italic> in New York. Davison remained close with <italic>Astor Trust</italic>, living next door to Howard Boocock, who gained seniority at <italic>Astor Trust</italic>. From 1894, Davison joined <italic>Liberty</italic> NB of New York, successively as assistant-cashier, VP and President. By 1902, he left with to join <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> as VP and conceived the idea of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>. \nAs NBs and most SB commercial banks could not engage in trust business, they referred out trust business. Davison\u2019s proposed a captured trust company without competing with banks. <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> became a \u2018bankers\u2019 bank\u2019 by holding reserves for anthracite firms and interstate banks and trusts, while providing loans to help banks meet demands and reserves. <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>\u2019s board comprised of twelve Protestant men from New York commercial banks, four from out-of-town commercial banks, and three from investment banks. \nTaking over <italic>Liberty</italic> NB\u2019s office with legal counsel from <italic>White Case</italic>, <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> was led by <italic>Liberty</italic> NB President Edmund Converse\u2014a grandson of a Congregationalist Reverend, second cousin twice removed of George Peabody, and fifth cousin of <italic>COALH</italic>\u2019s Marcus Converse Hanna\u2014alongside George Perkins of <italic>Morgan</italic>, James Blair of <italic>Blair</italic>, Barton Hepburn of <italic>Chase</italic> NB, William Porter of <italic>Chemical</italic> NB, <italic>Fourth</italic> NB\u2019s James Cannon,, Gates McGarrah of <italic>Leather </italic>NB, Davison and Thomas Lamont of <italic>Liberty</italic> NB/<italic>First</italic> NB<italic> of New York</italic>, <italic>First</italic> NB director William Moore of <italic>Moore</italic>, and Samuel Bayne of <italic>Seaboard</italic> NB.\nEdmund Converse\u2019s third cousin once removed, Charles Dawes organized <italic>Central Trust</italic> of Illinois in 1902, where he served as President and Chair. Descended from William Dawes, who alarmed the settlers with Paul Revere of the approach of the British at the start of the <italic>Revolutionary</italic> war, Ohio-born Charles Dawes was also William Whitney\u2019s third cousin once removed\u2019s husband, John Rockefeller, Sr\u2019s second cousin once removed\u2019s wife\u2019s great nephew, and Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s sister-in-law\u2019s husband\u2019s third cousin once removed. \nAfter graduating from <italic>Marietta College</italic> and <italic>Cincinnati</italic> Law, Dawes practiced law in Lincoln, Nebraska, from 1887 to 1894, with a focus on railroad freight rates. Running the McKinley and Roosevelt campaigns in the West, Dawes raised funds from Armour, McCormick, and other Chicago magnates. McKinley\u2019s Comptroller of the Currency from 1897, Dawes resigned in 1901 to run for Congress unsuccessfully.\nGates McGarrah\u2019s Scottish ancestors arrived in America in 1781, and engaged in commerce in Upstate, New York, for generations. Since starting his career in 1881 as a junior clerk at <italic>Goshen</italic> NB in Goshen, New York. In 1883, he moved to New York City and joined <italic>Produce Exchange Bank</italic>. He later became Cashier of <italic>Leather </italic>NB, where he was appointed President in 1888. By 1904, <italic>Leather </italic>NB merged with <italic>Mechanics</italic> NB, with McGarrah continuing as President. \nSince McGarrah\u2019s third cousin twice removed, Reuben Moffat, married an American Barclay (of unknown relation to <italic>Barclay</italic>) in 1852, their son wed Alex White\u2019s sister in 1891. Since his grandfather founded <italic>White</italic> in New York in 1837 and invested in <italic>Water Power Co</italic> of Spokane, Washington, in the 1890s (unaffiliated with <italic>JG White</italic>), White graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> and founded <italic>White Weld </italic>in 1895 with Boston Brahmin Francis Minot Weld, whose family had an original <italic>Harvard</italic> Overseer.\nThe Middlebury, Vermont-born descendant of Reverend Thomas Hooker, William Porter started as a clerk at <italic>5</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Av Bank</italic>. After eight years, he departed to become cashier of <italic>Chase</italic> NB, ascending to VP in 1891. Seven years down the line, he earned the role of VP at <italic>Chemical</italic> NB. Davison\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the native-born son of a Scotch-Irish Methodist minister, Lamont was educated at <italic>Philips Exeter </italic>and <italic>Harvard</italic> as a Presbyterian. Lamont was also an extended relative of <italic>Jesup</italic>, where Benjamin Schenck Strong started his career. Soon promoting Lamont, Davison replaced him with Strong, a descendant of Elder John Strong\u2014who was also an ancestor of John Morgan\u2014and an extended cousin of Moses Allens, Enoch Clark, Levi Morton, and John Morgan. \nStrong\u2019s great-grandfather served as Alex Hamilton\u2019s first clerk in UST before presiding over <italic>New York</italic> <italic>Sugar Refining Co</italic>, <italic>Dry Dock Co</italic>, and co-founding <italic>Seamen</italic>\u2019s<italic> Bank for Savings</italic>. Strong\u2019s father and grandfather graduated from <italic>Columbia</italic>, and his maternal grandfather was an influential Presbyterian minister. While two of Strong\u2019s brothers graduated <italic>Princeton</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic> to become <italic>Columbia</italic> physicians, another graduated <italic>Stevens</italic> to become a VP of <italic>American Radiator </italic>and engineering consultant. As Strong became treasurer of <italic>Englewood Hospital </italic>in 1900, he befriended President Henry Davison, who made him a Secretary at <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>. After his first wife committed suicide, Strong married Converse\u2019s daughter by 1907.\nNot closely related to Benjamin Schenck Strong, Edwin Schenck descended from the Knickerbocker Schaacks. Working in media and news until 1892, he began banking as assistant cashier at <italic>Hamilton Bank</italic>, rising to cashier, VP, and President. In 1901, he became VP of <italic>National Citizens Bank</italic> of New York and served as President from 1902 until merging with <italic>Chemical</italic> NB in 1920. While his eldest brother, Henry, was President of <italic>Bowery Savings Bank</italic>, brother Charles was Cashier of <italic>Societe Estate</italic>, and Frederick married a DeSaussure and presided over <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB from 1908 until becoming President of <italic>Liberty</italic> NB until his death in 1913.\nBorn in Colton, New York to an old Scotch military family, Barton Hepburn briefly studied at <italic>Middlebury</italic> <italic>College</italic> before teaching mathematics and practicing law in Colton. He also served as school commissioner in Saint-Lawrence until he was elected to the state Assembly from 1875. He was appointed superintendent of the state banking department in 1880 and became Comptroller of the Currency in 1892. \nAfterward, Hepburn became President of <italic>Third</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>, and subsequently VP of <italic>Citi</italic> NB for 2 years before becoming President of <italic>Chase</italic> NB, succeeding Henry Cannon, who soon became Chair. Cannon was born on in Delhi, New York, worked in banking until becoming Controller of the Currency in 1884 and then joining <italic>Great Northern</italic> RR\u2019s James Hill to acquire <italic>Chase</italic>. Cannon\u2019s brother, James, began working at <italic>Fourth</italic> NB of New York in 1876 as a messenger and was later elected VP, serving until becoming President in 1910. In 1903, he was a founding director of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>.\nWhile <italic>Chase</italic> did not have strong ties to religion, Hepburn soon hired Albert Wiggin. Born in Medfield, Massachusetts, to a Unitarian reverend, Wiggin joined <italic>Commonwealth Bank</italic> after his studies. In 1891, his he was appointed an assistant NB examiner for the Boston district. Three years later, he became the Assistant Cashier at <italic>Third</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic>. His career took a significant turn in 1899 when he moved to New York to become VP of <italic>National Park Bank</italic>. A large purchaser of CP, the bank\u2019s board included John Astor, August Belmont, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Stuyvesant Fish, and Isaac Guggenheim. By 1903, Wiggin played a pivotal role in organizing <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, despite his relative youth and limited experience. \nSamuel Bayne was born in Ireland, of Scotch-Irish descent. While his father owned a tannery, farms, and stores, his mother, whose kinsman was Reverend John Dixey, who had hosted Charles II for a week. While he married a descendant of a royal Reverend James Stuart, his cousins included a linen manufacturer in Belfast and a Managing Director of <italic>Dickson Ferguson</italic>, the largest linen firm at the time. Bayne entered the linen business with his cousins, which boomed during the blockade of the South during the <italic>Civil War</italic>. After the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>, he emigrated to America and organized an oil well supplier. In 1880, he founded <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Bradford</italic>, Pennsylvania, serving as the first president, and later organized NBs in Texas, Kansas, Mississippi, Minnesota, and Ohio. Moving to New York, he co-founded <italic>Seaboard</italic> NB in 1883 for lending on oil pipeline certificates. \nBy 1905, Bayme helped relaunch <italic>Columbia Trust</italic> along with Barton Hepburn, Albert Wiggin\u2019s brother Langley, and Henry Goldman.  Guggenheim and Goldman were some of the few Jews amidst the Protestant awakening, which did not stop at banking. Born in Ohio to a Congregational minister who had co-founded the federal <italic>Fisk Uni</italic> during <italic>Reconstruction</italic>, Paul Cravath was an <italic>OIL</italic> salesman until attending <italic>Columbia</italic> Law. Although he had sought to return to <italic>OIL</italic>, his performance attracted the attention of Charles Hughes. The <italic>Columbia</italic> Law educated son of a Welsh minister, Hughes and his father-in-law invited Cravath to form <italic>Carter Hughes Cravath</italic> in 1888. Before this firm grew into one of the nation\u2019s largest as <italic>Hughes Hubbard Reed</italic>, Cravath resigned by 1891 to join <italic>Blatchford </italic><italic>Seward DaCosta</italic>, which reorganized several more times after 1900, but retained his name (\u201c<italic>Cravath</italic>\u201d). \nThe <italic>Panic of 1899 </italic>destabilized the new traction trusts. While <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>raised funds for the elevated <italic>Nassau Electric </italic>RR system,<italic> </italic>New York\u2019s <italic>Metropolitan</italic> streetcar HC sought relief due to overcapitalization. By 1902 <italic>Kuhn</italic> underwrote <italic>Metropolitan</italic> securities with advice from<italic> Cravath</italic> and backing from Thomas Ryan.\nIn 1900, New York\u2019s <italic>Rapid Transit Commission</italic> asked the Vanderbilts to finance New York\u2019s first subway; they declined. In 1900, William Whitney and <italic>Metropolitan </italic>also refused. So, <italic>Belmont</italic> bought the city contract for the underground subway for which he formed <italic>Interborough Rapid Transit </italic>with counsel from <italic>Strong Cadwalader</italic>. While <italic>Belmont</italic> settled a dispute with <italic>Gould</italic>\u2019s by leasing the elevated <italic>Manhattan</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Electric</italic><italic> </italic>RR for 999 years, Ryan and Belmont continued to compete. Still, <italic>Interborough</italic> gained investment from <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>, Vanderbilt, and <italic>Berwind</italic>, who had affiliated with <italic>Morgan</italic> to consolidate New York coal mining properties and became one of the world\u2019s largest individual owners \nThe burgeoning consumer rights reformists also shaped New York City traction. Born in Brooklyn to Russian immigrants in 1873, Julius Cohen studied law at <italic>New York Uni</italic> by 1896. He became involved in public issues, serving as chair of the legislative committee of the <italic>Citizens</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Union</italic> in 1902 which won free transfers for New York City public transit users and transit facility regulation. In 1907, Cohen established a law firm and later became counsel for the garment industry, addressing labor disputes. \nSince realigning from <italic>Morgan</italic> to <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and <italic>Speyer</italic> in the 1890s, <italic>PENN</italic> turned to <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Speyer</italic> by 1903. While <italic>PENN</italic>\u2019s lobbying banned rebates with IA1903, Congress empowered Roosevelt over big business with the <italic>Bureau of Corporations</italic> (\u201cBOC\u201d) amidst anti-<italic>OIL</italic> sentiment. Rejected by Republicans, Democrats adopted his federalized monopolies as <italic>Princeton</italic> Professor Woodrow Wilson called for greater executive power. \nIn 1904, the Court allowed DOJ to dissolve <italic>NTHWST</italic> despite trade, stopping HC mergers. While Dawes intervened on behalf of <italic>Central Trust</italic> director Armour, BOC still charged Chicago\u2019s meatpackers with violating AA1890 in 1904, but a district court extended immunity to the packers by holding that BOC\u2019s compulsive testimony violated the <italic>5</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> Amendment</italic>. The same year, a daughter of George Roberts\u2014<italic>PENN</italic>\u2019s long-time deceased president\u2014married a grandson of Enoch Clark, whose family had reorged <italic>COALB</italic> with <italic>Morgan</italic> in 1887.\nMergers also benefited from political connections. After American <italic>TOBACCO</italic> acquired Sands-in-law\u2019s <italic>Lorillard</italic> and sought to enter Britain in 1898, British firms consolidated in 1902 after the <italic>Panic of 1899 </italic>deflated prices. While <italic>Drexel</italic>\u2019s Wharton Drexel cousin married 1901 the son of a tobacco and snuff importer who became the German consul in Baltimore, London-born Cecil Baring married tobacco heiress Maude Lorillard a year after retiring from <italic>Kidder</italic> in 1901. Hailing from Virginia, Thomas Ryan\u2019s Democratic influence steered the party as he united leaders at the 1904 <italic>National Convention</italic>. That autumn, Ryan\u2019s <italic>TOBACCO</italic> stock-for-stock consolidation set a historical financial transaction record, consolidating scattered tobacco interests to control over 80% of American trade.\nAs <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s domestic and foreign market share shrank, DOJ sued to dissolve her. Roosevelt began to arbitrate strikes and Congress allowed DOJ to appeal decisions after the meatpacker decision. <italic>Kuhn </italic>ended railroad directorates as DOJ sued <italic>Alton </italic>for discriminatory pricing, and UST issued notes and bonds that qualified as NB reserves to buy public and railroad debt. After making a fortune at <italic>Housman</italic>, Bernard and a brother left to start <italic>Baruch</italic> in 1903, while another brother became partner at <italic>Housman</italic>, and cartelized Mexican rubber with <italic>Guggenheim</italic>, <italic>OIL</italic>, and Senator Aldrich, Rockefeller\u2019s in-law. \nBy 1905, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and Cassel consolidated Alaska mines into <italic>Guggenheim</italic>\u2019s <italic>Kennecott</italic>. That year, the nephew of a Christian Rothchild cousin married a Sturges second cousin once removed of John Morgan\u2019s wife. After <italic>Baruch</italic> bought shares in <italic>Utah Copper C</italic><italic>o</italic>, <italic>Guggenheim</italic> invested in 1906 with backing from William Whitney. While <italic>COPPER</italic> refused to participate in mining expansion, <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> secured <italic>Utah Copper</italic>\u2019s bond issue soon after.\nBrokers were especially dynamic at the time. Since Earl Grey became Governor of Canada in 1904, his son-in-law refocused <italic>Chapin</italic> <italic>Grenfell</italic> to speculate in securities there. As what soon-became <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Grenfell </italic>promoted Edward Grenfell to partner in 1904, the latter brought his cousin Vivian Smyth, the eldest son of former BOE Governor Hugh Smyth in 1905, <italic>Morgan</italic> also formed an alliance with German <italic>Dresdner</italic>. \nHowever, <italic>Housman</italic>\u2019s affiliate <italic>Vermilye </italic>dissolved as partners Donald Mackay\u2014not closely related to <italic>Bank of Nevada of San Francisco</italic> founder John Mackay\u2014and William Read, splitting into <italic>Mackay</italic> and <italic>Read</italic> in 1905. Although the royalty\u2019s favorite brokerage was <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic>, with <italic>Smyth</italic> cousin Lancelot Smyth as a main partner, mixed religion firms became more acceptable since <italic>Wagg</italic> appointed the Duke of Argyll\u2019s son, Walter Campbell, a brother-in-law of Queen Victoria\u2019s daughter, a director in the 1870s. \nLikewise, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London stopped favoring <italic>Wagg</italic>, engaging other brokers, particularly<italic> Gordon</italic><italic> </italic>founded by Harry Gordon. A son of a manager of<italic> Oriental Bank</italic> and director of <italic>Union Bank</italic> <italic>of London</italic>, he worked with <italic>Lindsay</italic> in Shanghai under a relative, and in 1876 founded <italic>Gordon</italic>. He underwrote international loans and industrial issues including brewer <italic>Lipton</italic>\u2019s 1898 flotation before dying in 1902. \nDirecting <italic>Gordon</italic>\u2019s foreign government loans, William Koch was born in Belgium to a Christian father and Josephine Laski, a converted great granddaughter of Samuel Zbytkower and step granddaughter of Samuel Frankel. By 1877, he settled in Britain and joined <italic>Gordon</italic>. He became a British citizen in 1883 and made partner in 1889. Within two years, he married his Laski cousin. Following Gordon\u2019s death in 1902, he became Senior Partner. By 1905, <italic>Gordon </italic>hired a son of HSBC\u2019s London manager.\nWhile <italic>Speyer</italic> and other bankers converted and married Christians in London and New York, Katz-descendant Frederick Phillips of London stockbroker <italic>Phillips </italic>promoted aristocrat Jack Churchill-Spencer to partner alongside Katz-descendant Hermann Marx, Nunes DaCosta, and others when he retired. And when the Amsterdam brokerage transformed into a bank, <italic>Mendes Gans</italic> added <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic> and Goldschmidt cousin Hendrik Mauritszoon alongside non-Jewish partners Walter Hethey and Marius Heybroek.\nSince immigrating to San Francisco with his brother Alexandre Weill in 1855, Raphael became a partner in <italic>JW Davidson Dry Goods Store</italic> by 1858, likely with family credit as two Lazard brothers left for France. As Raphael\u2019s influence expanded with the store, he established a Paris buying agency. After JW Davidson retired in 1885, and Raphael became senior partner, and re-incorporated as <italic>Raphael Weill </italic>in 1893. At the same time, <italic>Lazard</italic> San Francisco\u2019s Marc Meyer married<italic> </italic>two of his daughters to Levi Strauss\u2019 sons. With the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, Meyer joined Alexandre at <italic>Lazard</italic> New York. They also recruited George Blumenthal from <italic>Speyer</italic>and Eugene Arnstein. By 1899, Blumenthal married Meyer\u2019s daughter. \nHowever, disagreements with <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris led Meyer, Arnstein, and Blumenthal to resign in 1901. So, Weill appointed Charles Altschul\u2014<italic>Lazard</italic> San Francisco\u2019s eighth hire and married Arnstein\u2019s sister-in-law\u2014to lead the office. And as <italic>Lazard</italic> London functioned as bill agency accepting deposits from other immigrant banks for collection of foreign debts of <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris funded expansion from 1901. \nSince Marc\u2019s son, Eugene, also left <italic>Lazard</italic> New York to start his own firm in 1901 and collaborate with Baruch and a <italic>Morgan</italic> partner, Blumenthal returned to <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in 1904 as senior partner. In 1905, Weill grew <italic>Lazard</italic> London by hiring Robert Kindersley, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, from <italic>Bevan</italic>, a brokerage owned by the cousin of <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s chair. The same year, <italic>London & San Francisco Bank</italic>\u2014founded by <italic>Glyn</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>, <italic>Stern</italic>, <italic>Sulzbach</italic>, and <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen</italic>\u2014merged into the <italic>Seligman</italic> and <italic>Sassoon</italic>-funded<italic> Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>California Bank</italic>. \nTo distribute railway, electrification, and other public work deals in Morocco from 1902, <italic>Paribas</italic> organized a consortium including <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic>, and soon extended to <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Indochine</italic>. But as Germany challenged growing French control in Morocco, Britain\u2019s Cassel established the note-issuing <italic>Bank of Morocco</italic> to support France. While Germany sought to extend <italic>ORIENT</italic> into oil-rich Iraq supported by Dutch bankers in 1903 until Britain\u2019s new protectionist Minister dissuaded Cassel<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic>the soon-to-be <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> from participating. As France sought to colonize Morocco, tensions escalated between France and Germany in the <italic>Tangier Crisis of 1905</italic> until European powers backed France in 1906.\nIn 1906, as aluminum patent protection ended, the global cartel renewed her agreement for five more years, allowing progressive quotas as the market grew. Despite a global rise in aluminum prices due to copper speculations, the cartel raised the official aluminum price. This decision encouraged electrical and chemical producers to invest directly in the industry instead of buying from the cartel. \nThat year, Belgian King Leo II\u2019s <italic>Comit\u00e9</italic> and SG <italic>Belge</italic> established, <italic>Bas-Congo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Katanga</italic> RR with<italic> </italic><italic>Parisienne</italic>, and <italic>Congo </italic><italic>Foresti\u00e8re </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Mini\u00e8re </italic>(\u201c<italic>Formini\u00e8re</italic>\u201d) with <italic>COPPER</italic>\u201ds <italic>Ryan</italic> and <italic>Guggenheim</italic>, and <italic>Union Mini\u00e8re</italic> with <italic>Tanganyika Concessions</italic>, formed by Cassel\u2019s <italic>Hirsch</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent, <italic>Lambert</italic>, in 1899. That same year, <italic>Union Mini\u00e8re</italic> signed an agreement with <italic>British South Africa </italic><italic>Co</italic> to export copper via the Beira route using Wankie coal. While <italic>British South Africa </italic>supported <italic>Bas-Congo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Katanga</italic> RR through an internal credit system involving <italic>Erlanger</italic> Paris, <italic>Tanganyika </italic>held voting power and board seats in <italic>Mini\u00e8re</italic> and controlled <italic>Benguela</italic> RR, which connected Katanga to Lobito.\nBut while Germans established a new Italian mercury mine in 1897\u2014supplied to Central Europe via the big three metal distributors\u2014<italic>Rothschild</italic> declined to cartelize her Spanish mercury with them. NYSE grew in 1905 as <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic>, and Cassel floated NYSE loans to fight the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic>, consolidate <italic>Mexican</italic> RR along with <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic>, and <italic>Berliner</italic>, and\u2014beat out <italic>Morgan</italic> to\u2014build London\u2019s<italic> Underground </italic>with <italic>Cazenove</italic>. \nIn Britain, as <italic>Midland</italic> and Quaker <italic>Lloyd</italic> BHCs acquired banks, <italic>Pease</italic> and twenty Quaker banks fused into <italic>Barclay</italic> with Bevan and Smyth-in-law leadership and <italic>Samuel</italic> investment in 1896. (<italic>Midland</italic> and <italic>Lloyd</italic> soon joined <italic>Lyonnais</italic> and <italic>Deutsche </italic><italic>Bank</italic> as the world\u2019s largest banks before American banks merged in the 1920s. While Quakers and Jews were involved in <italic>Lloyd</italic> and <italic>Deutsche</italic>, these banks were generally of the majority religion, involving <italic>Midland</italic>\u2019s Anglicans, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>\u2019 Catholics, and <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Lutheran Siemens Junkers.) But as Continental banks in London gained control over the <italic>pound</italic>, <italic>Midland</italic> opened a FX department in 1905 for to reduce dependence as <italic>Barclay</italic> acquired Cornish banks.\nHaving begun his career at <italic>Shell</italic> in 1901, Robert, the grandson of Nathaniel Cohen-Barent and Jacob Waley\u2014cousins of Rothschild, Samuel, and Katz\u2014played a key role in the amalgamation of <italic>Shell</italic> and <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> in 1907, becoming a director and later chair of the British entity, <italic>Anglo-Saxon Petroleum </italic>(\u201c<italic>Shell</italic> Britain\u201d). Since <italic>Shell</italic> remained a dually-owned company, with <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> owning 60%, and <italic>Rothchild</italic> London and <italic>Samuel </italic>being large investors in <italic>Shell</italic> Britain, Vivian and his cousin Abel Smyth soon linked the <italic>Shell</italic>, <italic>Samuel,</italic> and <italic>Burma</italic> oil ventures. By 1908, Chancellor of Exchequer Herbert Asquith became British PM. While he had married a sister-in-law of former PM William Gladstone\u2019s nephew, his son married a descendant a descendant of Abel Smyth that year.\nMeanwhile, bankers restructured luxury retail. <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>Paris linked jewelers via marriage. In 1837, Charles Tiffany and John Young founded <italic>Tiffany</italic> <italic>Young</italic> in Manhattan, offering stationery and costume jewelry. After the store evolved into <italic>Tiffany Young Ellis</italic>, and sold real jewelry, silverware, and various sundries in 1841, they introduced sterling silver to America in 1852 and partnered with silversmith John Moore. The following year, Charles Tiffany bought out his partners and absorbed Moore\u2019s firm, forming <italic>Tiffany</italic>. While forming <italic>Tiffany</italic> London in 1868, <italic>Tiffany</italic>\u2019s prestige with the elite soared after winning awards at the <italic>Paris Exposition</italic> in 1878. Moore\u2019s son managed <italic>Tiffany</italic> Paris and married a daughter of <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>Paris\u2019 Senior Partner John Harjes in 1886. \nAlthough rivals, Charles Tiffany was an acquaintance of Louis Cartier. Cartier began as a jewelry apprentice in Paris under Adolphe Picard. In 1847, he purchased Picard\u2019s business and founded <italic>Cartier</italic>. His work gained popularity among Parisian society, notably finding favor with Princess Mathilde, a cousin of Napoleon, who became his influential patron. As the business extended internationally, <italic>Cartier</italic> London opened in 1902 and her reputation soared as she became the royal jeweler. \nAfter moving to Alsace during the <italic>Franco-Prussian War of 1870</italic>, Court Jew descendant Ernest Wertheim transitioned from his family\u2019s necktie business to a partnership with <italic>Bourjois</italic>, which produced fragrances, theatrical makeup, and a best-selling rice face powder, <italic>Java</italic>. By 1898, Wertheim became a full partner in the distribution of <italic>Bourjois </italic>products in America.\nIn 1895, Albert Kahn opened <italic>Galeries Lafayette</italic>, a Parisian shop specializing in gloves, ribbons, and veils. By 1898, Kahn added his cousin Theophile Bader and bought surrounding properties. Since 1894, Bader had been married to Jeanne Bloch, of unknown relation to the Polish bankers. While Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df was her fourth cousin, Aron of Phalsbourg descendant Esther Cerf Aron Lazard was her third cousin four times removed and her second cousin once removed\u2019s wife\u2019s mother. They formalized <italic>Galeries </italic>in 1905, with Bader as President. Gaining investment from <italic>Dreyfu\u00df </italic>Basel in 1894, <italic>Galeries </italic>was also friendly with Koechlin-in-law\u2019s <italic>Franco-Swiss Bank</italic> from 1896. \nIn Britain, Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer<italic> </italic>grew <italic>Marks Spencer</italic>. Marks, likely born into a rabbinical family in Slonim, Russian Belarus, fled to Britain in 1882 after the persecution of Jews after Tsar Alex II\u2019s assassination. Separated from his family and not a synagogue goer, Marks started selling penny-priced goods in a small market stall in Leeds. His \u2018penny bazaars\u2019 expanded to Warrington, Birkenhead, and other towns. By 1894, Marks sought to grow the business and partnered with Spencer in <italic>Marks Spencer</italic>. While unrelated to aristocratic Churchill cousins, Spencer was a devout Protestant Yorkshireman and cashier for textile wholesaler. Together, they branched to Manchester, Birmingham, and Newcastle. With Spencer semi-retiring in 1903, the <italic>Marks Spencer</italic> partnership incorporated. \nIn America, a Protestant crowded out Jews and most other dry good dealers. After the <italic>Civil War</italic>, <italic>Crow McCreery Drygoods</italic> of Saint-Louis made Davis Walker a partner by 1865 and hired Frank Ely. Their work accelerated as former UST Secretary James Guthrie resigned as Senator from Kentucky and Thomas McCreery ascended the post from 1868. Over the following years, Frank Ely married McCreery\u2019s niece, and Davis Walker reorganized the firm as <italic>Ely Walker</italic> under Ely and grew into the Midwest\u2019s largest dry goods wholesaler. \nAfter Ely died in 1890, Walker became President of <italic>Ely Walker</italic>. As price cutting by mail order houses like <italic>Sears</italic> and <italic>Ward</italic> squeezed the small retailers that constituted <italic>Ely Walker</italic>\u2019s clients, Walker refused to sell to them. From 1902, however, Walker sold to Missouri-born JC Penney\u2019s <italic>Penney</italic> chain, which spread out across the country. As <italic>Ely Walker</italic> remained <italic>Penney</italic>\u2019s main source of supply for years, they came to accountant for a third of <italic>Ely Walker</italic> sales. \nHaving started at <italic>Ely Walker</italic>, Davis Walker\u2019s son George established <italic>Walker</italic> in 1900 to buy and trade companies. swiftly ascended to prominence in Saint-Louis, acquiring <italic>Laclede Gas</italic>, <italic>New Orleans, Texas, & Mexico</italic> RR, and other Texan railroads. <italic>Walker</italic> co-founder was a son of Thomas West, had traded cotton in Mobile, Alabama, before organizing <italic>Saint-Louis Trust </italic>in 1889. The latter merged with <italic>Union Trust </italic>to form <italic>Saint-Louis Union Trust</italic>, where he became President while also directing <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Saint-Louis</italic>. \nSo, Jewish merchants and bankers focused on the coasts. Possibly a Katz-descendant from Posen, William Kats moved after the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>. By 1856, he opened a small store in Salem, Massachusetts and Romanized her surname to \u2018Filene.\u2019 Moving to Boston, <italic>Filene</italic> soon became one of the largest specialty stores. As Filene\u2019s son married a Katz and Oppenheim descendant in 1895, another merchant banker thrived in New York.\nSince studying in the same synagogue in Bavarian W\u00fcrzburg, Marcus Goldman and Joseph Sachs moved to America. While Goldman moved to New York in 1869 and founded <italic>Goldman</italic> to discount credit for diamond and leather merchants, his daughter married Henry Gallenberg, a cousin-in-law of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Solomon Loeb, in 1870. After Joseph Sachs\u2019 daughter wed Samuel Hammerslough, an in-law of Samuel Rosenwald, in 1872, two of Joseph\u2019s sons married Marcus\u2019 daughters by the end of the decade. While Marcus formed <italic>Goldman Sachs</italic> (\u201c<italic>Goldman</italic>\u201d) in 1882 with one son and a son-in-law, his <italic>Harvard</italic> dropout son Henry joined his brother-in-law Gallenberg\u2019s dry goods store. By 1885, Marcus added Henry and Gallenberg as junior partners.\nHammerslough\u2019s in-law Samuel Rosenwald began as a peddler before becoming a clerk at the Hammerslough brothers\u2019 Baltimore clothing store. In 1857, he married Augusta Hammerslough, and together they managed clothing ventures in Illinois, Alabama, and Indiana, outfitting soldiers during the Civil War. In 1878, the Samuel\u2019s son Julius Rosenwald moved to New York to work for his Hammerslough uncles. After Julius co-founded a men\u2019s clothing manufacturing business with his cousin in Chicago in 1885, his brother-in-law Aaron Nusbaum invited him to invest in <italic>Sears Roebuck</italic>, a growing mail-order company, in 1895.\nEarlier, Richard Sears, a Christian Minnesota railway agent, bought unwanted watches for resale. His success led him to form <italic>Sears Watches</italic> and move to Chicago and partner with Alvah Roebuck in 1893. Initially targeting farmers with their first catalogue, <italic>Sears </italic>grew to become the largest mail order house in the world. While Nusbaum joined as a partner in 1895, Roebuck left the company by 1897. So, Sears invited Aaron Nusbaum and brother-in-law Julius Rosenwald into the partnership. \nAlso in 1897, <italic>Goldman</italic> became <italic>Kleinwort</italic>\u2019s correspondent to access London\u2019s MMBU. After Paul Goldman Sachs graduating <italic>Harvard</italic>, married a Katz, and became a <italic>Goldman</italic> partner in 1904, <italic>Goldman</italic> soon fused with <italic>Lehman</italic> to create <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic>. As <italic>Lehman</italic> began liquidating their Louisiana and Alabama partnerships to Newgass and Stern cousins, <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> parlayed their <italic>Kleinwort</italic> partnership to underwrite their first IPO for <italic>United Cigar Manufacturers </italic>in 1906. When Julius Rosenwald of <italic>Sears</italic> faced financial difficulties, and approached his cousin Henry Sachs for a loan, <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> underwrote the first retail chain IPO for <italic>Sears</italic> that year. \nAfter several failed attempts in Massachusetts, the Quaker Rowland Macy, a descendant of Benjamin Franklin\u2019s uncle, started <italic>Macy</italic> in New York in 1858. Competition grew as the son of a Bavarian immigrant, Abram Abraham apprenticed with Benjamin Altman and Simon Bloomingdale, each of whom organized a New York department store. By 1865, Abraham organized <italic>Wechsler Abraham</italic>. As the <italic>Civil War </italic>ended, the Lehman and Greenbaum affiliated Straus family moved from Georgia to New York City and opened a crockery and glassware store. By 1873, <italic>Straus</italic> opened their own department in <italic>Macy</italic>\u2019s basement. After Rowland Macy died in 1877, Straus bought <italic>Macy</italic> shares. Continuing to grow, Straus and Abraham reorganized <italic>Wechsler Abraham</italic> to <italic>Abraham</italic> <italic>Straus</italic> in 1893 and took over <italic>Macy</italic> by 1895, which soon became America\u2019s largest department store. Likewise, Strauses married an Abraham and Lehman by 1902. \nStraus\u2019 extended cousin, Henry Greenbaum\u2019s second cousin once removed, wed a nephew of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Eugene Arnstein in 1896. One of Chicago\u2019s first Jewish bankers in the 1850s, Greenbaum restarted with <italic>Greenbaum SB & Trust</italic> after his banks failed in 1877. His brother-in-law, fellow Bavarian Gerhard Foreman, also started a bank and saw his cousin marry Abraham Kuhn\u2019s cousin in the 1890s before incorporating <italic>Foreman</italic> SB in 1897.  By then, Abraham Becker\u2014brother-in-law of <italic>Schaffner</italic> and an extended cousin-in-law of Greenbaum and Seligman families, but unrelated to the Christian co-founder to <italic>Rothschild</italic> affiliated <italic>Becker Fuld</italic>\u2014founded <italic>Becker</italic>, focusing on commercial paper out of Chicago.\nSince <italic>Macy</italic> heir Oscar Straus graduated <italic>Columbia</italic> Law in 1873, he practiced law and entered politics, serving as America\u2019s Minister to Turkey from 1887 to 1889, securing <italic>Macy</italic>\u2019s sale of oriental rugs and advocating for Jewish aid in Russia. He became the first Jew to hold a in America\u2019s Cabinet, serving as Secretary of Commerce and Labor under President Theodore Roosevelt from 1906 to 1909, before returning to Turkey as Ambassador for a year. (Over four decades earlier, Judah Benjamin had become the first Jew in a North American Cabinet for the Confederacy in 1861.) By 1907, Nathan, the son of Oscar\u2019s brother, Congressman Isidor, wed Therese Kuhn of <italic>Kuhn</italic>.\nAfter joining Vanderbilt and <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s Rockefeller and Rogers, and others to start<italic> Mutual Alliance Trust </italic>in 1902, Lehman\u2019s <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB merged with Charles Morse\u2019s bank and another New York City bank. Edwin Gould took charge as the director. As Morse consolidated <italic>Bank of the State of New York</italic> and NB<italic> of North America </italic>in 1905, he oversaw over thirteen bank and trusts. \nAs a solution for American small business owners and workers against bankers, William Filene\u2019s son Edward became America\u2019s leading financier of the cooperative credit union movement after visiting India in 1907. At the same time, retailing heirs faced competition. One of the few first-generation storekeepers were Herbert Marcus, his sister Carrie, and her husband Al Neiman, who founded <italic>Neiman Marcus</italic> in 1907 in Dallas after a stint in advertising in Atlanta. Carrie Marcus Neiman remained one of the industry\u2019s few influential women.\nSince <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s London partnership, the soon-became <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> Grenfell </italic>promoted Edward Grenfell to partner in 1904, the latter brought his cousin Vivian Smyth, the eldest son of former BOE Governor Hugh Smyth in 1905, <italic>Morgan</italic> also formed an alliance with German <italic>Dresdner</italic>. Following the <italic>Russo</italic><italic>-Japanese War</italic>, Grenfel\u2019s cousin-in-laws Edward Baring and Edward Grey secured British participation in Russia\u2019s 1906 loan, facilitating the rapprochement with the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907. By early 1907, Walter Morgan Burns\u2014John Morgan\u2019s nephew and partner of the London partnership\u2014married Evelyn Livingston Cavendish, a cousin of the New York Livingstons and London Smyths and Grenfells.\nWhile UST stabilized seasonal currency demand\u2014and so MMSEC\u2014<italic>Panama Canal</italic> payouts depleted gold in 1905. As<italic> </italic>UST waited for tax revenues,<italic> Kuhn</italic> partner Jacob Schiff lobbied for a CP-backed elastic currency. After <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Kindersley sold debt for the Quaker-led <italic>Newcastle upon Tyne Electric Supply</italic>, possibly Britain\u2019s only financially successful PU, in 1906, he expanded across the British Empire. After <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s largest promotion was for <italic>Canadian Northen</italic> RR to link Montreal to Vancouver in 1908. \nKindersley hired Robert Brand in 1909. The Anglican grandson of Henry Brand\u20141st Viscount Hampden and fourth great-grandson of King Charles II\u2014and a daughter of  Eliza\u2014who was born out of wedlock to Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, and Georgiana, daughter of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer, who was  married to William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire. Brand\u2019s cousin included Spencers, <italic>Glyn</italic> bankers, the Lascelles, and his uncle\u2019s second cousin was Horace Farquhar, the Duke of Fife\u2019s partner and <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC director. Brand served in the <italic>Colonial Service</italic>, drafting South Africa\u2019s constitution. Other Kindersley hires include a German from Riga and a relative of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul with Mexican connections.\n<italic>Kuhn</italic> partnered with <italic>OIL</italic> and syndicated deals to SBs<italic>.</italic> While Schiff joined<italic> Citi</italic>\u2019s board, Otto Kahn invested in <italic>Knickerbocker </italic>SB. <italic>Knickerbocker </italic>was led by Charles Tracy Barney\u2014the son of a banker, second cousin of John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife, and extended cousin of Jay Cooke\u2019s son-in-law Charles Dennis Barney, who reorganized the failed <italic>Cooke</italic> into <italic>Barney</italic>\u2014and a brother-in-law of <italic>OIL</italic> co-founder and former State Department Secretary William Payne Whitney, an extended cousin of John Morgan and his Tracy wife. \nBy 1905, Charles Tracy Barney\u2019s daughter married Whitney\u2019s cousin. With branches in Britain and France, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s partners across NBs and SBs across America operated as family units. <italic>Morgan</italic> led the NYCH banking cartel with Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Citi</italic> NB<italic>, Kuhn</italic>, and <italic>First </italic>NB <italic>of New York</italic>, run by <italic>Schley</italic> SB\u2019s father-in-law, George Baker. While <italic>Morgan</italic> affiliated bankers lived around John Morgan in the West 30s, <italic>Kuhn</italic> and the Jewish bankers developed the Upper West Side. \nMoreover, the influx of Russian refugees developed New York City. Having fled Eastern European pogroms, Jewish immigrant garment workers shaped and expanded the American clothing industry, notably contributing to the rise of ready-to-wear apparel. In 1900, Russian Jewish immigrants in New York City comprised a third of tailors, a fourth of seamstresses, about 40% of the hat and cap, and shirt collar industries, while nationally, in the seven largest cities, they represented 35% in hats and caps, 27% in shirt, collar, and cuff making, 29% in tailoring, and 14% in seamstressing, not counting Jews from Rumania, Hungary, and Austria. While many had focused on such light industries in Europe, mechanized mass production forced Jewish artisans from small shops into sweat shops.\nFrom Poland, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris began their American careers as laborers in New York City\u2019s garment sweatshops. From investing minimal capital to first open their sweatshop, and then owned the largest, most modern factory in the trade, <italic>Triangle Shirtwaist</italic> factory. Samson Wallack, among Manhattan\u2019s earliest Jewish shirt manufacturers, founded his firm in 1860. \nWhile one of Samson\u2019s son took over the business, another son, Leo, began practicing law in 1874 and founded <italic>Wallac</italic><italic>k</italic><italic> Cook</italic>, serving <italic>Memphis-Charleston</italic> RR and <italic>Georgia</italic> <italic>Central</italic> RR, and served as counsel for <italic>New York Times</italic> from 1896. Leo was also a director at <italic>Knickerbocker </italic>SB, <italic>Coal & Iron Bank</italic>, and <italic>Mount Vernon Trust</italic>. His co-founder,  San Francisco-born Alfred Cook, advised Adolph Ochs\u2019 purchase of <italic>New York Times</italic> in 1896 and served as Counsel, he married Eugene Meyer\u2019s sister in 1902.\nFrom 1903, Harlem experienced a surge in real estate investment, transforming the area with extensive building activities. The completion of the subway in 1904 further spurred construction, particularly in Central Harlem, resulting in the development of new tenement and apartment buildings. One of the most successful SB investors was Henry Guggenheim Morgenthau Sr\u2019s <italic>Central Realty Bond & Trust </italic>from 1899. Amidst the massive construction across New York, SBs could invest in real estate and did not have to hold reserves to pay out on-demand unlike NBs.  \nSo, NYCH linked SB clearing to reserves in 1903. While <italic>Knickerbocker</italic> joined NYCH, most SBs tapped MMBU in London. By 1905, New York investigated <italic>life insurance companies</italic> (\u201cLICs\u201d). LICs invested in MMSEC and <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic> securities and grew large without mergers or monopolization. Instead, they aggressively competed in selling pension-like <italic>tontines</italic>. Still, an internal power struggle triggered an investigation by New York\u2019s LIC regulator into industry practices and embroiled Wall Street. As a result, the state prohibited LICs from selling <italic>tontines</italic> and investing in stocks and unsecured debt from 1906. \nAmidst the scandal in 1905, Thomas Ryan rescued <italic>Equitable</italic> LIC by buying a controlling block. And since New York City\u2019s subway metro of 1904 disrupted New York City\u2019s streetcars, Ryan merged <italic>Metropolitan</italic> with <italic>Belmont</italic>\u2019s <italic>Interborough</italic>, integrating the competing surface lines into a unit with the subway and the elevated system under <italic>Metropolitan</italic> streetcar HC in 1906. But streetcar competition was a national urban problem. In Chicago, Chauncey Blair\u2019s son Henry served as receiver and director of <italic>North Chicago Street </italic>RR, <italic>West Chicago Street</italic> RR, and <italic>West Division </italic>RR. By 1907, he organized <italic>Chicago Railways Co</italic>, consolidating surface lines on the north and west sides of the city. \nWhile London financed a significant amount of the capital needed to carry securities, country banks supplied most of the capital. After the <italic>NTHWST</italic> and LIC restrictions, NYSE and MMSEC shrank. Instead, SBs invested in illiquid real estate, raising national interest rates. Since <italic>Lehman</italic>, Vanderbilt, and <italic>OIL</italic> established <italic>Mutual Alliance Trust </italic>in 1902, JT Gwathmey and cotton traders gained control in early 1906. This led to the retirement of the previous directors affiliated with <italic>OIL</italic>, while Lehman remained the board, joined by Straus and others.\nAlthough LA1889 stopped selling coal lands, LA1897 promoted timbering on federal lands. until Roosevelt withdrew them with LA1905. And, as the Court forbade RHCs from favorable coal sales to subsidiaries, coal land prices grew as LA1906 withdrew monopolized federal coal lands and  forced RHCs to separate commodities\u2014including coal and oil, but not timber\u2014from <italic>commerce</italic> by 1908. \nAs RHCs sold off assets, investment fell, and car shortages grew. IA1906 also authorized ICC to cap rates and extended ICC\u2019s jurisdiction to common carriers and pipes. Since <italic>Morgan</italic> acted as a central clearinghouse for private equity investments, <italic>OIL </italic>requested they remain in a trust with <italic>Kuhn </italic>and <italic>UPR</italic>\u2019s <italic>Chicago & Alton RR</italic> venture after <italic>NTHWST</italic>\u2019s dissolution. By November, the youngest daughter of <italic>Great Northern</italic> RR\u2019s James Hill married Michael Gavin, <italic>Schley</italic>\u2019s head of legal affairs.\nWhile <italic>Alexandria Stock Exchange</italic> commenced in 1888 with the arrival of the French to the cotton port, transactions remained insignificant until it merged with <italic>Cairo Exchange</italic> in 1906. In April, an earthquake devastated San Francisco, sparking fires that destroyed <italic>Raphael Weill</italic>\u2019s department store and much of the city. Since the earthquake required insurance British insurer payouts, gold shipments accelerated. \nSo, BOE raised rates and constrained MMBU for American SBs in late 1906. However, higher interest rates quickly deflated Egypt\u2019s cotton real estate boom forcing BOE to bailout the landbank <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic>. While <italic>Parisienne</italic> had dispatched Maurice Millet from France as her first permanent Egyptian representative, scandal led her to replace him with Rene Ismalun, an Austrian subject and Cattaui in-law. \nIn Britain, merchant banker <italic>Huth</italic>\u2019s Meinertzhagen family, already cousins of the Unitarian Holt family cotton brokers who co-founded <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic>, kinterlinked with the Booths of Liverpool\u2014whose <italic>Booth </italic><italic>Shipper </italic>held a strong position in South American, especially Amazon, trade, and <italic>Surpass Leather</italic> maintained a near monopoly in patent leather\u2014in 1905. \nSince his cousin and partner Frederick Huth Jackson married Clara Duff in 1895, whose brother married a <italic>Lubbock</italic> heiress in 1906, who reinforced the banking partnership by kinterlinking with an in-law of <italic>Lubbock</italic> co-founder and Cornwall copper banker William Vivian Lemon\u2019s great-granddaughter. And in America, <italic>Phelps Dodg</italic><italic>e </italic>and <italic>Hartley</italic> <italic>Graham</italic> heir Marcellus Hartley Dodge married Ethel Rockefeller within months and later inherited the <italic>Remington Arms</italic> chairmanship from his father.\nAs UST lobbied Congress for emergency reserves powers, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Paul Warburg urged for a central bank in the media. Like BOE\u2019s constraint, New York initiated SB trust reserve requirements at 15 and deprioritized NYCH claims in failed SBs to favor court-appointed receivers. NYCH had less reason to clear for SBs. \nHaving consolidated Eastern coastal shipping, Morse formed <italic>STEAMSHIP</italic> on January 2, 1907. But with less BOE credit, American credit need grew. After previously stalled negotiations, Chicago meatpackers with interests in New York\u2019s<italic> National Exchange Bank</italic> acquired neighboring <italic>Irving</italic> NB by the 8th, soon fusing the two into <italic>Irving Trust</italic>. At the same time, Heinze seized control of <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB from Edwin Gould, with support from Morse. As Heinze and Morse bought banks, their banks bought Morse\u2019s <italic>STEAMSHIP</italic> and Heinze\u2019s <italic>United Copper</italic> securities. Neither could Gould rely on <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic>. Along with several other New York SBs, Emanuel Lehman sat on <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB\u2019s board since reorganizing her in 1880 until dying on the 9th. \nIn March, <italic>UPRHC</italic>, <italic>COALA</italic>, <italic>STEEL</italic>, and <italic>COPPER</italic> share prices collapsed, forcing <italic>Kuhn </italic>to carry new <italic>UPRHC</italic> issues. <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Jacob Schiff pleaded with Roosevelt for ICC to cartelize railroads. While IA1906 gave RHCs a year to divest commodities, DOJ sued <italic>COALA</italic> per AA1890. After DOJ sued <italic>TOBACCO</italic> and <italic>Schley</italic>, a court fined <italic>OIL</italic> $29 million in August. As Rockefeller supported his stock, <italic>Schley</italic> heir Reeve Schley wed a Prentice cousin-in-law of the <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic>\u2019s Isham, and Rockefeller families as he became a <italic>Simpson Thatcher</italic> lawyer, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> bailed out <italic>Belmont</italic> as New York City\u2019s <italic>Metropolitan</italic> streetcar HC\u2014also financed by<italic> Kuhn</italic> and <italic>TOBACCO</italic>\u2014lost liquidity. As <italic>Metropolitan</italic> streetcar\u2019s creditors filed for a <italic>Wabash</italic>-style receiver, they hired <italic>Untermyer</italic> to defend against New York\u2019s attorney general\u2019s AA1890 in October.\nWith BOE\u2019s interest rates hike, global copper pools destabilized, and <italic>COPPER</italic> refused to support prices like they did in 1901. Heavy losses at <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen </italic>led to an internal management reorg. While Heinze attempted to corner <italic>United Copper</italic> shares, the corresponding shorts could deliver. Morse had betrayed Heinze by selling the shorts his shares. Morse had no choice as NYCH refused to discount for him to finance <italic>STEAMSHIP</italic>. Moreover, Morse borrowed fraudulent loans from NB<italic> of North America</italic> to pay interest. After receivers took over NB<italic> of North America</italic>, depositors were subsequently reimbursed in full. As creditors ran from Morse\u2019s <italic>Mercantile </italic>NB, NYCH found it solvent but extended liquidity conditional on Heinz\u2019s resignation.\nAfter his appointed committee of young bankers, including Henry Davison of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> and Benjamin Strong of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, reported large illiquid Upper West Side real estate and <italic>Trust Co of America</italic> SB dues, John Morgan refused to clear for<italic> Knickerbocker. </italic>Without support from NYCH, <italic>Knickerbocker</italic> fire sold assets and called in loans and the bankruptcy court scrutinized setoff-able transactions, creditors ran from <italic>Trust Co of America</italic> in October. <italic>Knickerbocker</italic>\u2019s Charles Tracy Barney shot himself amidst the crisis. While director Leo Wallack\u2014Jewish shirt manufacturer heir and Senior Partner of law firm <italic>Wallac</italic><italic>k</italic><italic> Cook</italic>\u2014took part in <italic>Knickerbocker</italic>\u2019s reorg and eventual payment resumption, Charles Dawes rejected a later invitation to lead <italic>Knickerbocker</italic>, criticizing New York\u2019s hereditary bankers. \nThe same day, <italic>Kuhn </italic>forced <italic>Westinghouse</italic>\u2019s founder out and took control in receivership. The contagion spread to European banks as mining projects collapsed. Likewise, <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s <italic>GAS</italic> reneged on Canadian ventures. With <italic>TOBACCO</italic> under DOJ investigation, Gates-<italic>Schley</italic> also came under pressure. Earlier that year, Gates-<italic>Schley</italic> has issued <italic>COALT</italic> illiquid shares and carried the stock using collateral loans ahead of placement. Gates\u2019 raid on <italic>Belmont</italic> of 1901 replayed. Unable to meet margin calls, <italic>Schley</italic> and <italic>Trust Co of America</italic> offered <italic>Morgan</italic> shares of <italic>Tennessee</italic>, <italic>TOBACCO</italic>, or <italic>Kennecott</italic> securities as collateral. \nUpon consultation with Oliver Payne\u2019s lawyer Lewis Cass Ledyard, <italic>Morgan</italic> secured Roosevelt\u2019s approval that a <italic>Tennessee</italic> deal would not violate AA1890, <italic>STEEL</italic> acquired <italic>Tennessee</italic>\u2019s shares and alleviate the panic by settling debts in <italic>STEEL</italic> shares. Likewise, banking and copper reinforced links, with Seligman and Lewisohn marrying and Felix Thalmann Rosentower joining <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> while his brother was a partner at<italic> </italic><italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic><italic>, </italic>which represented <italic>Metallgesellshaft</italic>\u2019s American interests.\nWithout a central bank, UST approached French BDF for a gold loan. Helping end the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, BDF accelerated gold payments for American crops. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> provided short-term loans via<italic> Belmont</italic>, BDF allowed <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and other banks to buy American coins, sending large amounts of gold to America. As UST<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic><italic>Morgan</italic> lent on UST and railroad bond collateral,<italic> </italic>Rockefeller funded an SB bailout fund as the SBs refused to. Runs ended as banks suspended and NYCH issued certificates, but inter-state trade deflated as western clearinghouse certificates limited outside transactions. While Dawes convinced the UST Secretary to deposit federal funds in Chicago banks to halt the currency drain, other states adopted bank holidays. \nSince New York SBs formed a clearinghouse, SB trust losses were low, but demand deposit banks failed. After allowing courts to appoint SB receivers in 1907, New York switched to state bank regulators from 1908. By autumn, Thomas Ryan merged New York City LICs, NBs, and trusts to exceed the reparations of France to Germany in 1870 and Russia to Japan in 1905. Ryan\u2019s influence controlled a billion dollars of <italic>Mutual</italic>, <italic>Equitable</italic>, and <italic>Washington</italic> LICs; <italic>Commerce</italic> NB; and <italic>Morton</italic>, <italic>Guaranty</italic>, <italic>Mercantile</italic>, and <italic>Equitable </italic>SBs. Oklahoma started deposit insurance that year, and other Democratic agricultural states followed. \nSince California\u2019s earthquake and fire destroyed much of the city in 1906, only a single SB failed due to the destruction of their records. The earthquake and the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic> required <italic>Lazard </italic>New York to advance funds to her <italic>London, Paris</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> & American Bank</italic> in San Francisco<italic>.</italic><italic></italic> When the Lazards left San Francisco in 1885, they asked Sigmund Grunebaum to manage their land. Grunebaum, born in Bavaria in 1843, came to San Francisco in 1857, founded a mercantile and commission house, and in 1893 became manager of <italic>London, Paris</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> & American Bank</italic>. In 1905, Grunebaum\u2019s daughter married Herbert Fleishhacker whose brother Mortimer married an in-law of the Seligmans. \nThe Fleishhackers\u2019 father was  born in Bavaria, immigrated to America in 1845, and  traded in California and Nevada from the 1850s, establishing a paper box factory and paper business. While his Mortimer joined his father\u2019s business around 1890 and organized <italic>Truckee River General Electric Co</italic>, <italic>American River Electric Co</italic>, and <italic>City Electric Co</italic>, and <italic>Central California Traction Co</italic> by 1905) while Herbert began as a bookkeeper in 1887, became a salesman, and established paper mills in Oregon before joining <italic>London, Paris</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> & American Bank </italic>in 1907. \nIn 1908, <italic>London, Paris</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> & American Bank</italic> converted into a NB and then merged with <italic>Seligman</italic>\u2019s <italic>Anglo-California</italic>, under the leadership of Grunebaum and Fleishhacker. The Fleishhackers also organized<italic> </italic><italic>Anglo-California Trust</italic> as a SB in 1909. By 1912, <italic>Anglo-California Trust</italic> absorbed <italic>Central Trust Co</italic>, <italic>Swiss-American Bank</italic>, and other California banks. Grunebaum\u2019s son Fred, meanwhile, became a Partner of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York. Since <italic>Lazard</italic> New York recruited Frankfurt-born Paul Baerwald from <italic>Speyer </italic>London in 1907, he married Isaias Hellman\u2019s daughter-in-law's sister in 1909.\nAs the Lazards instructed the Fleishhackers to sell their California lands to oil speculators from 1915, Eugene Meyer joined <italic>Chase</italic> in Edward Doheny\u2019s oil venture in Texas. The Meyer family\u2019s former mentor Bernard Baruch, meanwhile, joined San Francisco banker William Crocker in exploring for gold in Alaska in 1915. Crocker\u2019s father was a co-founder of <italic>Central Pacific </italic>RR. In 1911, Crocker\u2019s son wed Helen Irwin, daughter of <italic>Spreckels</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> partner of Hawaii. The union dissolved in 1928, and Helen wed a Hawaiian trader. \nAs California banks consolidated, <italic>Bank of California</italic> acquired <italic>San Francisco</italic> NB, which had evolved from Sather Church, <italic>Drexel</italic>\u2019s California partnership from the 1850s. However, <italic>Bank of California</italic> fell behind other fast-growing competitors. John Demartini was born in Italy and, like his sister Virginia, immigrated to America around 1870. He settled in San Francisco and in 1878 founded <italic>Demartini</italic>, a wholesale fruit business that grew into one of the Pacific\u2019s most prominent. \nAfter the death of her first husband, Luigi Giannini, Virginia married Lorenzo Scatena, who went on to become one of the largest wholesale produce commission brokers on the Pacific Coast. Joining his stepfather in business, Virginia\u2019s son Amadeo married the daughter of an Italian-American real estate investor, Joseph Cuneo, who was a director of the Italian-American focused <italic>Columbus</italic> S&L of San Francisco.\nIn 1900, <italic>Columbus</italic> experienced a bank run from small depositors after rumors circulated that its President was selling off real estate and leaving for Europe, leading Isaias Hellman\u2014then director of <italic>Columbus</italic> and President of  <italic>Bank of</italic> <italic>Nevada</italic> <italic>of San Francisco</italic>\u2014to affirm the institution\u2019s solvency. Restored, <italic>Columbus</italic> added Amadeo Giannini as director following the death of his father-in-law. However, as Giannini sought to serve more small depositors in 1904, Hellman helped the oust him, leading Giannini to start a competitor <italic>Bank of Italy</italic>, with capital from Scatena and Demartini to serve small depositors. During the <italic>Panic of 1</italic><italic>9</italic><italic>07</italic>, Giannini offered gold to <italic>Crocker</italic>, which refused.\nLikewise, Ohio banker Abraham Monnett\u2019s son Mervin became a director, and in 1887 President of <italic>Second</italic> NB in Bucyrus, Ohio. Following financial losses in 1897, he relocated to Colorado Springs, invested in mining, then moved to Nebraska in 1898, where he involved in stock operations. In 1905, Monnette opened <italic>Hayes-Monnette</italic> mine in Goldfield, Nevada before moving to Los Angeles in 1907, acquired control of <italic>American</italic> NB, and in 1909 merged her with <italic>Citizens</italic> NB, becoming VP. \nWhile <italic>Raphael Weill</italic> soon rebuilt and remained a Pacific icon for decades, it did not expand. Still, luxury retail kinterlinks continued. In 1909, Marc Meyer\u2019s son Edgar married a <italic>Saks</italic> retail heiress. While they had a daughter, Edgar died shortly thereafter on the <italic>Titanic</italic> disaster and his widow married a Lehman cousin. (Other <italic>Titanic</italic> deaths included head of the American Astor family John Astor and his wife, copper heir Benjamin Guggenheim, and <italic>Macy</italic>\u2019s Isidor Straus and his wife.) \n<italic>Lazard</italic> Paris similarly kinterlinked. As Ernest Wertheim\u2019s sons Paul and Pierre joined <italic>Bourjois</italic>, they loaned Parisian department store <italic>Galeries Lafayette</italic>\u2014led by Lazard and <italic>Dreyfu\u00df </italic>cousin-in-law Theophile Bader<italic>\u2014</italic>to enlarge into a new building in 1909, providing a convenient way to expand the rapidly growing market for <italic>Bourjois</italic>. After Pierre married the daughter of Rachel Lazard Aron and stockbroker Edmond Revel in 1910, he sold <italic>Bourjois</italic><italic> </italic>products distribution American rights back to <italic>Bourjois</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Franco-Swiss Bank</italic>\u2019s Benjamin Rossier of<italic> </italic>supported <italic>Galeries </italic>through capital increases in 1909 and 1912 and joining her board from 1910. By 1914, <italic>Galeries </italic>employed over 1,000 staff, with significant mail-order sales, cementing its position alongside <italic>Printemps</italic> in the Paris market, though trailing <italic>Bon March\u00e9</italic> and <italic>La Samaritaine</italic>. \nSeveral months before <italic>Knickerbocker</italic> director Leo Wallack\u2014Jewish shirt manufacturer heir and Senior Partner of law firm <italic>Wallac</italic><italic>k</italic><italic> Cook</italic>\u2014took part in the trust\u2019s reorg and eventual payment resumption, his daughter married real estate heir Henry Morgenthau Jr\u2019s cousin and, by 1909, Henry\u2019s sister wed Maurice Wertheim\u2014of unknown relation to Samson Wertheim\u2014who led <italic>United Cigar</italic>, and joined <italic>Hallgarten</italic> in 1911. Since <italic>Goldman Lehman </italic>underwrote <italic>United Cigar</italic>, they took <italic>Underwood Typewriter</italic>\u2014with Henry Sr as a Director\u2014public in 1910. By 1912, they funded department store <italic>Woolworth</italic>.\nAlthough leaders in CP for decades,<italic> Goldman</italic> <italic>Lehman</italic> underwrote their first corporate bond in 1909 and continued to expand their retail services for long-term clients. <italic>Goldman</italic> <italic>Lehman</italic> also kinterlinked with <italic>Lazard</italic>. After Charles Altschul\u2019s son Frank joined <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in 1908, Charles\u2019 daughter Edith married Herbert Lehman in 1910. By 1913, Frank married Herbert\u2019s niece, Helen Lehman Goodhart, taking over <italic>Lazard</italic> New York when Charles retired in 1916.\nLikewise, Herbert\u2019s nephew married a Seligman heiress in 1912 as her cousin married Philadelphia department store heir Bernard Gimbel, who soon acquired <italic>Saks 5</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> Av</italic> with <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> aid. While Henry Morgenthau Sr later served as President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s Ambassador to Turkey, Henry Jr worked with Hoover\u2019s <italic>Food Administration</italic> project. In 1916, he wed Elinor Lehman Fatman, cousin-in-law of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Rheims family. \nIn Britain, Thomas Spencer retired from <italic>Marks Spencer</italic> in 1905, and Michael Marks passed away in 1907. After Marks\u2019s death, his son Simon began buying equity, while Michael\u2019s executor, William Chapman, managed the company and grew her to 145 branches. Simon\u2019s friend Israel Sieff, born in Britain to a Lithuanian descended from the Exilarch of Babylon, Wilna Gaon, and the Katz and Gunzburg families, married Simon\u2019s sister in 1910. Ousting Chapman and taking control by 1916, Marks and Sieff expanded <italic>Marks Spencer</italic> into one of Britain\u2019s leading retailers.\nLikewise, Protestant <italic>Morgan</italic> kinterlinked luxury. While <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>Paris\u2019 Harjes in-law John Moore became CEO of <italic>Tiffany </italic>jewelers in 1907, <italic>Cartier</italic> New York opened in 1908. By 1912, Louis Cartier\u2019s son married John Moore\u2019s Harjes sister-in-law. After divorcing French Count Castellane in 1907, Jay Gould\u2019s daughter Anna wed his cousin, acquiring the titles of Duchess of Talleyrand and Princess of Sagan. As the families continued to marry European royalty, Anna\u2019s niece married Anthony Drexel\u2019s grandson in 1910, bonding Gould and <italic>Morgan</italic> interests.\nSince forming during the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic> with backing from <italic>COPPER</italic>, <italic>National Copper Bank</italic> merged with <italic>Metals</italic> NB in 1909. The following year, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>increased her capital with a changed directorate as allies consolidated industrial banking. Thomas Lamont, who moved from <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> to VP of <italic>First</italic> NB, Gates McGarrah, whose <italic>Leather</italic> & <italic>Mechanics</italic> NB took over <italic>Metals</italic> NB, and Edgar Marston of <italic>Blair</italic> and <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, replaced James Speyer, Walter Oakman, and J.R. Maxwell. After acquiring <italic>Morton Trust </italic>and <italic>Fifth Avenue Trust</italic> in 1910, <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>absorbed <italic>Standard Trust</italic> in 1912. While William Potter\u2014a Christian whose father had led <italic>American Trust & Savings Bank</italic> of Chicago and wife was a Boston Brahmin cousin of <italic>Lee</italic> bankers\u2014joined <italic>Guggenheim</italic> at the turn of the century, he joined <italic>Guaranty </italic>as VP in 1912, latter returning to lead <italic>Guggenheim</italic> Chile before heading <italic>Guaranty</italic>.\nAs the Court supported IA1906 and DOJ against coal cartels\u2014leading L&N to distribute coal assets\u2014they struck down federal labor and state fare laws.  While <italic>STEEL</italic>, <italic>SHIP</italic>, and <italic>ALUM</italic> stabilized prices, <italic>Rothschild</italic> financed <italic>PENN</italic>. Still, tight ICC policy deflated road investment. By 1908, the collapsed demand felled the aluminum cartel of 1906, leading to the liquidation or mergers of uncompetitive firms. \nAlong with bankers, the crisis stimulated lawyers. Graduating from <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law by 1904, Waddill Catchings joined <italic>Sullivan</italic> and became involved in restructurings after the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>. His notable achievement came in overseeing the emergence of New York City\u2019s only steel mill, <italic>Milliken</italic>, from bankruptcy in 1909, for receiver Carl Glogau Heckscher. Following this, in 1910, Catchings was appointed receiver for <italic>Central Foundry</italic>, where he facilitated its operations amidst financial challenges and eventually assumed the role of president.\nWhile British <italic>Standard Bank</italic> expanded from southern Africa to New York, Hamburg, and East Africa, British bankers kinterlinked with Belgians as Brussels banker <italic>Philippson Horowitz</italic>\u2019s Franz Philippson  daughter married a Goldschmidt in 1901 and son wed a Mocatta in 1906. However, the <italic>P</italic><italic>anic </italic><italic>of 1907</italic> stalled <italic>British South Africa Co</italic>\u2019s copper ventures in Belgian King Leo\u2019s Congo Free State. Amidst continuing British protest of human atrocities, Belgium took control and colonized the Free State After Leo died in 1908. With finding from SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, <italic>Lambert</italic>, <italic>Philippson Horowitz</italic>, <italic>Cassel</italic> Brussels, <italic>Allard</italic>, <italic>Bunge</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and others funded, <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Belgian </italic><italic>Congo</italic> replaced <italic>Association Internationale Africaine</italic> within a year. SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, and <italic>Lambert</italic> also funded <italic>Banque Commerciale du Congo</italic>. \nAs President Roosevelt sued <italic>UPR, OIL, </italic>and <italic>Kuhn </italic>to dissolve <italic>UPRHC</italic>\u2014a year before Harriman\u2019s death\u2014he funded a rural life study in 1908. Rockefeller followed by selling <italic>Citi</italic> NB and funding the <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic>, which spurred water sanitation and lift Black life expectancy with <italic>TOBACCO</italic>\u2019s Dukes. While the Stillman and Rockefeller family continued to have influence in <italic>Citi</italic>, a first cousin twice removed of Robert Winthrop\u2014who had married deceased <italic>Citi</italic> President Moses Taylor\u2019s daughter in 1859\u2014married<italic> </italic><italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>\u2019s George Baker\u2019s son in 1911.\nAs the Court confirmed New York City\u2019s <italic>Metropolitan</italic> streetcar HC <italic>Wabash</italic>-style receivership,<italic> </italic>New Jersey expanded non-judicial receiverships to non-railroads. Since his <italic>Chicago Railways Co</italic> reduced operating expenses and improved service quality, Chauncey Blair\u2019s son Henry consolidated all of Chicago\u2019s elevated lines into <italic>Chicago Elevated Railways Collateral Trust</italic> in 1911. Additionally, Blair held directorships in <italic>Commonwealth Edison Co</italic>, <italic>Public Service Co of Northern Illinois</italic>, and <italic>Illinois Merchants Trust Co</italic>. And in Boston, <italic>Kidder</italic> combined traction into <italic>Boston Elevated Railway</italic>.\nWhile creditors reorganized <italic>STEAMSHIP</italic>, Morse battled law suits and prison sentences through the 1920s until his death. With deflated mining and drilling ventures, Republican states required even brokers to register securities and capped firm valuations. But Congress rejected Roosevelt\u2019s AA1890 amendment\u2014to allow him to decide monopolies without courts\u2014and regulate collateral loan risk. \nBy 1909, the son of William Moore, cofounder of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> and <italic>STEEL</italic>, married the niece of <italic>COALH</italic> magnate and former Senator Mark Converse Hanna, reinforcing the kinterlink of between <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> and <italic>COALH</italic>. As his brother Nathan ran <italic>Marquette Savings Bank</italic> and <italic>Washington Iron Co</italic> in Michigan, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Marquette</italic> President Louis Kaufman accepted the additional presidency of <italic>Chatham</italic> NB in New York in 1910, which he merged into <italic>Chatham Phenix</italic> NB <italic>& Trust</italic>, with fellow directors including <italic>Morgan</italic> and chemicals magnate Pierre DuPont.\nEndorsed by Roosevelt, Taft campaigned on federal bank stability and created the <italic>Post Office Savings Bank</italic> to issue UST debt-backed money.  extended involuntary liquidation to corporations, trusts, and SBs, not NBs, railroads, or cities. As NYCH allowed SBs to join, Congress extended clearinghouses inter-state. \nAmong the SBs to take advantage was <italic>Columbia Trust</italic>, which gained investment from Hetty Green in 1911. The following year, the SB merged with <italic>Knickerbocker</italic>, whose directors included Payne Whitney and Louis Boissevain. The same year, Chicago meatpacker-led <italic>Irving Trust</italic> bought <italic>Mercantile</italic> NB and Rockefeller-led <italic>Equitable Trust</italic> bought <italic>Trust Co of America</italic>.\nAfter the Court\u2019s 1895 decision, Congress amended the <italic>Constitution</italic> for UST to tax income. While regulating some federal monopolies like Roosevelt, Taft prosecuted anti-competition. As <italic>Morgan</italic>-controlled AT&T monopolized telephony and telegraphy by buying <italic>Western Union</italic> in 1909, Taft added telecommunications to ICC. Within a year, Taft appointed <italic>Seligman</italic> partner Frederick Strauss as vice chair of <italic>Railroad Securities Commission</italic>. \nAs <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s banker Oliver Payne aided <italic>STEEL</italic>\u2019s absorption of <italic>COALT </italic>in 1911, the Court dissolved <italic>OIL</italic>, <italic>TOBACCO</italic>, and <italic>UPRHC</italic> under the <italic>rule of reason</italic> to AA1890 for misconduct rather than <italic>per se</italic> illegality and added banks and insurance to <italic>Munn</italic>\u2019s state regulation of public interest. Reinforcing links among <italic>OIL</italic>, <italic>Citi </italic>NB, and oil roads, <italic>OIL</italic> heir and Rockefeller cousin-in-law Gordon Auchincloss married Thomas House\u2019s daughter in 1912. During the Civil War, House\u2019s cotton factoring firm in Houston worked closely with <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Charles Stillman, who transported Confederate cotton through Matamoros to avoid the Union blockade.\nAs <italic>Pierce Oil Corp</italic><italic> </italic>bought out <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s assets, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic><italic> </italic>handled the deal with an introduction from <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic>. While the Court did not consider <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s entry into America, <italic>OIL</italic> interests interlocked directorates and shared banking like they had in 1890. ICC allowed <italic>OIL</italic> to retain pipes but prevented railroads from supporting independent oil producers. Similarly, while <italic>TOBACCO</italic> allowed for some small competitors, the industry aggregated into five large companies without the cartel. \nWhen French firms formed a new international aluminum cartel in 1912, <italic>ALUM</italic> refused to join. Taking control of a new process patent, the French cartel and <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> creation <italic>Southern Aluminum </italic>in North Carolina. Under the new competition, <italic>ALUM</italic> joined the cartel. While <italic>ALUM</italic> domiciled most activities in Canada, American courts excused <italic>ALUM</italic> from anti-trust due to the existence of <italic>Southern</italic> and that the cartel only applied to foreign sales. While the Guggenheims sold most of their stake in <italic>SMELTER</italic> in 1907, their <italic>Kennecott</italic> bought the world\u2019s largest copper mine in Chile, where <italic>COPPER</italic> also expanded. Likewise, Hayden Stone expanded their interests from <italic>Utah Copper </italic>to <italic>Butte Copper</italic> in Montana. \nAfter DOJ sued GE, <italic>Westinghouse</italic>, and 33 other firms in 1911, GE absorbed an independent competitor to avoid price fixing. While DOJ\u2019s <italic>COALA</italic> case failed under Roosevelt, the Court prohibited volume pricing on appeal in 1912. Considering that a developed <italic>COALT</italic> would give <italic>STEEL</italic> a monopoly, Taft instructed DOJ to sue <italic>STEEL</italic> to sell <italic>Tennessee</italic>. Roosevelt opposed Taft\u2019s anti-trust policy and charged against his chosen successor in 1912. With a split Republican ticket, Democrat Woodrow Wilson won. As efforts for a <italic>Morgan</italic> Midwestern coal pool died, cheap oil-fueled trucks gained market share, railroad coal investment fell.\nIn other industries, <italic>Rockefeller </italic>cartelized the industry with <italic>Morgan</italic>. In 1873, <italic>OIL</italic> acquired control of a Cleveland-based paraffin wax candle, grease, and lubricant manufacturer, Herman Frasch patented methods to purify paraffin and refine petroleum and joined the company. In 1890, Frasch patented a sulfur extraction process, with Frank Rockefeller to form a syndicate challenging <italic>American Sulfur </italic>at Calcasieu. The discovery of sulfur in Texas in 1906 led <italic>S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Louis Gulf Sulfur</italic> investors to approach <italic>Morgan</italic> in 1909, who sent Bernard Baruch to evaluate, who withdrew with <italic>Morgan</italic>. While <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> incorporated <italic>Freeport Sulfur</italic> in 1912, <italic>Baruch</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic> took control of <italic>S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Louis Gulf Sulfur</italic> in 1916, and formed <italic>Texas Gulf Sulfur</italic>.\n<italic></italic><italic>Panics of the Great War</italic>\nThe assassination of Tsar Alex II Romanov in 1881 led Russia to sanction antisemitic actions, including discriminatory laws and pogroms, resulting in violent displacement of Jewish communities. Within a year, Maurice Ephrussi married Beatrice, the daughter of Alphonse, Head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and BDF Regent opening offices in Vienna and Paris as Jews fled Russia, and investing in Baku oil. Unable to negotiate a merger with <italic>Nobel</italic> interests in 1883, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris acquired a Russian competitor in 1886, and formed a cartel with <italic>Nobel</italic>. However, the stable profits pulled in <italic>OIL</italic>, which marketed American-refined oil in competition with Baku from 1888.\nSince 1883, Russia removed more restrictions on Old Believer, who could now occupy public positions, obtain passports, conduct public religious services, and build and repair houses of worship. After Timofei Morozov died in 1889, his wife Maria became head of <italic>Morozov</italic> and <italic>Nikolskaia Manufactory</italic>, modernizing with electricity and expanding exports. Their son, Saava, witnessing the resilience of the textile industry amidst the disasters of 1892, implored fellow industrialists to embrace electrification and comprehensive industrialization to prevent the recurrence of famines. Following oil focused and fellow Old Believer<italic> Volga-Kama Bank</italic>, Morozov-led <italic>Moscow Merchant Bank </italic>dominated Russian banking and withstood the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic>.\nRussian Orthodox serf-descendent Grigori Eliseev died in 1892, his sons Alex and Grigori II took over <italic>Eliseev</italic>. After a disagreement with his brother, Alex withdrew from the partnership. As Grigori II became the sole partner four years later, he also was the largest shareholder of <italic>Saint-Petersburg Discount & Loan Bank</italic>. Likewise, after Grigori\u2019s nephew Peter Eliseev died in 1901, Peter\u2019s son Stepan Eliseev inherited Peter\u2019s posts as Chair of <italic>Lloyd</italic> Russia insurer and VP of <italic>Russian Bank for Foreign Trade</italic>. As Alex continued directing <italic>Saint-Petersburg Accounting & Loan Bank</italic>, he married Elena, the daughter of hereditary citizen, Second Guild merchant Ivan Averin.\nIn late 1903, Savva Morozov met Leonid Krasin. Born to an Imperial police supervisor in Kurgan Russia in 1870, Krasin excelled in a technological university and played a pivotal role in the construction of the <italic>Trans-Siberian</italic> RR and the electrification of the Baku oil fields. He associated with Vladimir Lenin, initially disseminating Marxist literature, and engaging in Bolshevik revolutionary activities. Along with persuading Morozov to fund the Bolsheviks, Krasin joined Morozov\u2019s textile plants, and managed Orekhovo-Zuev\u2019s power station by 1904. He soon headed Saint-Petersburg\u2019s electricity board.\nWomen were also prominent. Rosa Luxemburg\u2019s paternal grandfather was a prominent merchant in Zamo\u015b\u0107, Galicia, while her maternal grandfather, a rabbi descended from the Katz and Peretz families, participated in the Polish revolutionary activities of 1846. Her father managed a timber business and often traveled to Germany and Warsaw. Pursuing a secular life, she earned a doctorate in political economics from <italic>Uni of Zurich</italic> in 1897, and moved to Germany. \nShe quickly became a key figure in the German socialism, known for her critical Marxist writings, she sometimes disagreeing with Lenin and was arrested by 1903.  Likewise, Elena Stasova, daughter of the noble lawyer Dmitrii Stasov, followed her father as a revolutionary and politician in Saint-Petersburg. Joining the Bolsheviks in 1898, she advocated for workers\u2019 rights and ascended to various Bolshevik Central Committees from 1904.\n<italic>Rothschild</italic> was split between safeguarding her Russian oil investments and ethically boycotting. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris focused investments on <italic>Exchequer</italic> debt,<italic> COPPER</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>, she drifted away from Russia. The relationship with <italic>Ephrussi</italic> also suffered. Estranged from Maurice Ephrussi since 1897 after the gambling addict\u2019s infidelity led Beatrice Rothschild to become barren. Still, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris expanded in <italic>Mazut</italic> and other Baku oil investments. \nBut Russian antisemitism spread. Since Bukharan Jews had escaped the <italic>Pale of Settlement </italic>and pogroms, they settled in Moscow and used bank credit to trade across the Empire. Likewise, many Ashkenazim moved to Bukhara in search of work, increasing labor competition. Although there were some intermarriages with Ashkenazim, the two groups largely remained separate. But after the Tsar annulled their property rights om 1889, he restricted their movement to mirror that of Ashkenazim by 1900. Like fellow Moscow Old Believer textile merchant Morozov in 1882, Mayor Alekseev, backed antisemitism in the <italic>Pale</italic> to diminish competition, but he aligned with Witte against antisemitism in Bukhara due to its hindrance to the cotton trade. \nThe first pogrom of the 20th century struck Russian Moldova during religious holidays in April 1903. While sparked by religion, the mobs quickly turned to sexual and anti-commercial violence. Witnessing the horrors spread to Ukraine, Golda Meir\u2019s family soon fled to America. During the violence in Kiew, Jews feared for their lives and sought refuge in hiding places. The pogrom caused many deaths, injuries, and extensive looting and destruction of property, including schools and homes of Brodsky and other Jews. \nThe military intervened, arresting over a hundred perpetrators, and damages were extensive, affecting thousands of shops, warehouses, workshops, and apartments. The pogrom spared hardly any Jewish home, store, or workshop. As Raisa Polyakov married Adolphe Rosenberg Hirsch, Beatrice separated from Maurice. \nInstead, as Horace Gunzburg funded Jewish resettlement, his siblings\u2019 children married the daughter of French oil refiners Emile Deutsch-Meurthe and Louise Halphen in 1902, and a French Rothschild and Robert Lambert Bauer in 1905 as Beatrice Rothschild\u2019s brother married Germaine Halphen, a Goudchoux and Katz-descendant and cousin of the Gunzburg, Fould, and Speyer families. However, financial losses drove Goldschmidt-in-law Solomon Gunzburg of <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Paris to commit suicide. \nRussia also faced threats from Japan. Private capital constructed Japanese railways in Japan since 1881. After winning Korea and Taiwan from China in the <italic>Sino-Japanese War</italic>, Japan failed to nationalize railroads in 1892. So, Japanese bankers connected Korean Seoul to Pusan and Uijuo, aiming to eliminate Russian influence, monopolize economic privileges, and support colonization. \nFollowing the death of founder Iwajiro Suzuki 1894, his wife Yone inherited his sugar refinery business. While Suzuki was the owner, Kaneko Naokishi served as the general manager and was instrumental in expanding the business into diverse industrial undertakings. In 1905, Suzuki sold the sugar refinery business for a substantial sum and used the proceeds to rapidly expand into other commodities, forming close ties with <italic>Bank of Formosa</italic>, and branched overseas to London, Hamburg, and New York. As Yone Suzuki remained the president and actively participated in policy and management decisions, Kaneko secured exclusive contracts and government monopolies and utilized his political connections to establish various monopolies. \nBankers also consolidated sugar globally. As Hungarian sugar mill owner and<italic> Rothschild</italic> Vienna affiliate <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic> joined <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Disconto </italic>to found <italic>Hungarian Sugar</italic> in 1889, tariffs and TA1890 inspired <italic>SUGAR</italic> in America. After the <italic>Spanish-American War</italic> in 1898, <italic>OIL</italic>, <italic>Citi </italic>NB, <italic>Lehman</italic>, and other American banks consolidated Cuban and Philippine sugar and other commodities. By 1899, Schiff joined <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s board. \nAmidst the Philippine revolution that followed, the Basque <italic>Luzuriaga</italic> became one of the world\u2019s biggest sugar companies. Since Raphael Suar\u00e9s founded <italic>Egypt</italic> <italic>Sugar </italic>with French capital in the 1890s, the company successfully operated several sugar factories in 1902. By 1906, <italic>Royal Bank of Canada</italic> became Dominican Republic\u2019s second largest foreign private bank, primarily involved in sugar. And amidst Russian antisemitism, Polyakov marry-partnered with sugar-baron Brodsky before merging with their <italic>Kiew</italic><italic> Industrial Bank</italic>.\nIn 1904, Finance Minister Witte began using foreign Jewish circles to urge the cession of anti-government funding activities. He appointed Gregory Vilenkin in London, linked through his Seligman wife to Schiff, as his American agent for negotiations. Despite his efforts, Vilenkin\u2019s proposal came too late, and negotiations failed. As Dutch <italic>Lippman Rosenthal</italic> joined <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, and other Franco-German bankers helped the German Kaiser support his cousin in Russia against Japan in the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic>, with loans from<italic> Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Schiff, <italic>Warburg</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, Cassel, Levita, and <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s Marcus opposed Russia\u2019s abuse of Jews and funded Japan to seize Manchuria and Korea coal lands. Unable to transport enough Ukrainian coal, Russia lost. \nHowever, especially since Russian pogroms from 1882, transnational banking Jew networks cemented. The head of <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic>, Europe\u2019s largest grain trader, Louis Louis-Dreyfu\u00df was born to an Aron cousin and wed Emmy, a Katz-descendant born to ennobled Rothschild-cousins d\u2019Worms and Baron Levi of Florence in 1906. Around the same time, Louis-Dreyfu\u00df started a Parisian bank. Shortly after, his extended cousin Jules Dreyfu\u00df, an in-law of the Brodsky and Gunzburg families, became a partner<italic> </italic>of <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt. \nWhile his brother worked with their cousins at <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt, Eugen Brettauer earned his doctorate and became the legal representative of <italic>Mercur</italic> <italic>B</italic><italic>ank</italic> in Vienna by 1891. Brettauer joined the administration of <italic>Bozen-Meran</italic> RR in 1896 and was appointed Deputy Chair of <italic>Mercur</italic> in 1898, becoming Chair in 1905 and President in 1910. By 1915, he held various directorates, including <italic>Hungaria Allgemeine Assekuranz</italic> in Budapest, <italic>Bosnian Timber Extraction</italic> in Sarajevo, and <italic>Styria Electricity Co</italic> in Graz.\nBy 1912, another Dreyfu\u00df cousin married the son of Emile Oulman. Born in Frankfurt, Oulman was Jacob Schiff\u2019s extended cousin and his brother married Rothschild\u2019s Sichel cousin in 1870. After joining <italic>Comptoir</italic> Brussels in 1875, he transferred to <italic>Comptoir</italic> Paris in 1879. Oulman was appointed Head of the Foreign Department in 1882 and Secretary-General in 1890. He joined the Board of Directors in 1905 and was made Vice-Chair of <italic>Comptoir</italic> and received the <italic>L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur</italic> in 1908. \nEven when leaving their religion, Jewish bankers linked nations within empires. Rudolf Sieghart led <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic> from 1910. The son of a Silesian rabbi, he moved to Vienna after his father died to study law. He wed a co-religionist Hungarian, whose father was a prominent Vienna jurist and mother a Luria descendant of the promotor of Polish Hasidism, Uzziel Meisel. \nWhile his sister-in-law wed a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and <italic>Bondi</italic>, Rudolf\u2019s cousin married an in-law of the Pollak and Porges families and his second cousin wed a descendant of Samson Wertheim. After managing the liberal party\u2019s press office, he joined the Ministry of Finance. In 1895 he converted to Catholicism and changed his surname to Sieghart. By 1899, the Minister appointed him as confidential secretary.\nBefore WWI, Christian industrialists\u2014Stinnes, Krupp, Haniel, and Thyssen\u2014topped German taxpayers along with \u201cJewish\u201d financiers\u2014Mendelssohn, Rothschild, Oppenheim, and Warburg. In 1910, <italic>Levy</italic>\u2019s Louis Hagen facilitated the merger between GGE and electrical engineer <italic>Felten Guilleaume Lahmeyer</italic>, leading to GGE\u2019s acquisition of the <italic>Lahmeyer</italic> dynamo works in Frankfurt and a majority stake in cable manufacturer <italic>Felten Guilleaume Carlswerk.</italic>\nSince his grandfather clerked as <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne\u2019s cashier and established his own Cologne bank, <italic>Levy</italic>, Louis\u2019 father grew by marrying the daughter of steel and weapons manufacturer<italic> Coppel</italic>. After the death of his father in 1873, Louis, who had converted to Catholicism, took over <italic>Levy</italic> and, in 1886, married Anna Hagen, adopting her Christian surname. In 1890, he co-founded explosives firm<italic> K\u00f6lner Rottweiler Pulverfabriken</italic> and, later, facilitated the merger of <italic>Wissener Mining & Smelting</italic> with <italic>Zypen Wissener Ironworks</italic>. \nAfter the 1910 merger, as GGE\u2019s Vice-Chair Walther Rathenau negotiated steel supplies from <italic>Kl\u00f6ckner</italic> and <italic>Krupp</italic>, he pursued a merger with <italic>Krupp </italic>in 1910 for long-term steel supply. As <italic>Felten Guilleaume</italic> rejected the merger, <italic>Krupp</italic> acquired cable manufacturer <italic>Westf\u00e4lische Drahtindustrie</italic>. By 1911, Coppel in-laws kinterlinked with Ruhr banker <italic>Hirschland</italic> of Essen, Krupp\u2019s long-term banker. \nMeanwhile, since Chief Rabbi of Vienna Adolf Jellinek\u2019s sons were baptized, one pursued academia and married Camilla Wertheim, a Catholic of unknown relation to Samson Wertheim, another son, Emil, became involved with <italic>Daimler</italic> automotive in 1895 and named a car after his daughter Merc\u00e9d\u00e8s. Following Daimler\u2019s death in 1900, Emil Jellinek secured exclusive distribution rights in France, Belgium, America, and Austria. Likewise, Alfred Kaulla and other Jewish bankers gained board seats as the Daimler family lost control. Emil retired from <italic>Daimler</italic>\u2019s board by 1909. \nWhile <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> bought <italic>Daimler</italic> shares in 1909, she declined a seat on <italic>Daimler\u2019</italic>s board, instead allowing the <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic> to represent her interests. Since Adolf Jellinek\u2019s brother Moritz served as the General Director of <italic>Budapest Tramway Co</italic> until his death in 1883, when his son Ludwig took over. Ludwig\u2019s daughter married Stefan Ulman, whose uncle Adolf Ulman was President of <italic>Hungarian</italic> <italic>Creditbank</italic>.\nSimultaneously, one of Ulman\u2019s cousins married a fellow Catholic convert, Lucy Kayn-Speyer in 1910. From the Frankfurt banking cousinhood, Lucy\u2019s father was a Vienna banker, aunt had married Galician railroad magnate Sigmund Rietzes, and uncle wed a daughter of Galician timber magnate Leo Popper. By 1912, Lucy\u2019s sister married a fellow converted Johann Pereira Arnstein, a Luria-descendant grandson of <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic>Nathan Arnstein.\nThe Kayn-Speyer were cousins of <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Mannheim heir Moritz Ladenburg. Back in 1879, Moritz\u2019s brother Emil of Mannheim founded <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic> in New York and associated with <italic>Bank of Frankfurt</italic>, GRB, and <italic>Disconto</italic>. While one son Adolf established <italic>American Metal Co</italic>, another managed <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Frankfurt, served on the boards of <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> and <italic>Disconto</italic>. His son Max was involved with GRB, <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>, and <italic>Disconto</italic>. By 1905, <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Mannheim merged with <italic>Disconto</italic>. \nEmil Ladenburg also partnered with other German financials. Since <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>\u2019s Bavaria representative Theodor Cramer-Klett\u2014a Lutheran owner of <italic>Maschinenfabrik</italic> <italic>Augsburg N\u00fcrnberg</italic> (\u201cMAN\u201d)\u2014and <italic>Merck Finck</italic> founded <italic>Munich Reinsurance</italic> (\u201c<italic>Munich Re</italic>\u201d) in 1880, Cramer-Klett died in 1878. <italic>Merck Finck</italic> then co-founded insurer <italic>Allianz</italic> with capital from <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, <italic>Bayerische Vereinsbank</italic>, and Emil Ladenburg in 1890. As he took sole ownership of <italic>Merck Finck</italic><italic> </italic>from 1897, Wilhelm Finck\u2019s investments included hydropower projects, breweries, and <italic>Munich Tram Co</italic>, and he became one of Bavaria\u2019s largest landowners.\nBy then <italic>Bayerische </italic>bought out her co-founder, Munich bank <italic>Guggenheimayer</italic>, a co-founder of GGE, in 1892. After selling the bank, Emil Guggenheimayer became a director of MAN by 1903. While Guggenheimayer\u2019s aunt married a Kaulla cousin-in-law, an uncles married a Porges descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, and another uncle married a cousin of Oscar Oppenheim Wassermann\u2014a Katz-cousin and descendant of a Bavarian Court Jew and a cousin of Fuld, Rothschild, and Speyer, and brother-in-law of Samson Wertheim\u2019s fifth great-granddaughter\u2014who joined <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Board in 1912.\nIn France, a brother of <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic>\u2019s founder, Richard Thalmann married Emma Heilbronn in 1894. While Thalmann later founded <italic>Thalmann</italic> Paris with Emma\u2019s brother, Emma\u2019s other brother co-founded <italic>Heilbronn Herrmann</italic> bank with Gustave Herrmann and married Herrmann\u2019s cousin Claire Goldschmidt, whose sister Lucie married Andr\u00e9 Lazard.\nBy then, <italic>Rheinische Credit</italic> co-founder Ladenburgs kinterlinked with<italic> W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic>, which was co-founded by <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> cousin-in-law Alex Pflaum. Born to Pflaum\u2019s cousin, the Ulrich sisters had kinterlinked the Baer, Gerstle, and Hirschhorn families. While Anna Ulrich married Augsburg banker August Gerstle, her sister Marie wed Julius Baer of Switzerland in 1891. While his aunt married a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, Baer\u2019s extended cousin-in-laws included Otto Kahn. \nGerstle introduced Baer to industrial financing, including MAN and engine innovator Rudolf Diesel. Another of Marie\u2019s sisters, Bertha, married Ludwig Hirschhorn, a cousin once removed of South African diamond magnate Ernest Hirschhorn Oppenheimer, cousin of another <italic>DeBeers</italic> director, and a cousin-in-law of the Ehrman family. Hirschhorn co-founded <italic>Hirschhorn</italic> bank of Zurich and invited Julius to join in 1896 after his partner left. Although Ludwig Hirschhorn\u2019s cousin once removed married a descendant of Samson Wertheim in 1901, Baer later took full ownership of <italic>Hirschhorn</italic>, which he renamed <italic>Baer</italic>. \nMeanwhile, imperial powers competed to stake claims in the wake of the Ottoman weakness. Immediately after forming, <italic>Parisienne</italic> then set out on a strategy with which she eventually branched to 34 cities across the Ottoman Empire, Greece, Ukraine, and Egypt, controlling most of the leading Balkan banks within a decade. By 1904, <italic>Parisienne </italic>invested in <italic>Bank of Athens</italic>, which Rodocanachi, Ralli, Baltazzi, Mavrogordatos, and other Chiot diaspora shipping banker cousin-in-laws started in 1893. \nCompeting with the French <italic>Bank of Athens</italic>, German and British founded Greek banks. Representing German interests, Competing with the French <italic>Bank of Athens</italic>, German and British founded Greek banks. Representing German interests, <italic>Nationalbank</italic> partnered with <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>to establish <italic>Banque d\u2019Orient</italic> in Athens in 1904. Within a year, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, and <italic>Nationalbank</italic> founded <italic>Orientbank</italic>, which took over <italic>d\u2019Orient</italic>\u2019s branches in Hamburg and Constantinople and branched to Cairo, Alexandria, Brussa, Kalamata, Constantinople, Salonica, Izmir, Tangier, and Casablanca. As <italic>Nationalbank</italic> formed a community of interest with <italic>Pal\u00e4stinabank</italic>, linking their operations in Haifa, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Beirut, and Hamburg in 1905, <italic>Dresdner </italic>allied with <italic>Morgan</italic>. \nA director of <italic>d\u2019Orient</italic>, Petro Camora, married a Mavrogordatos cousin-in-law of the Baltazzi, Rodocanachi, and Sina families. On the <italic>d\u2019Orient</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Orientbank</italic> boards, Leonidas Zarifi of Constantinople represented Turkish interests and Georges Streit, of German heritage and a son of the Governor of <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, represented Greek interests. \n<italic>Orientbank</italic>\u2019s employees also provided international linkages. The Cairo branch, for example, was directed by Randolph Said Ruete\u2014the German national son of a deceased Hamburg merchant and the exiled sister of the Sultan of Zanzibar\u2014and Albert Erfield\u2014the Persian subject of Jewish-Polish origin who worked as an accountant at <italic>Ottoman</italic> <italic>Bank </italic>in Port Said. Salomon Meyer, a British Jew, was responsible for the securities department. The same year, Mavrogordatos cousins in Egypt founded <italic>Egyptian Land Bank</italic>.\nAnd for British interests, Gregory Embedocles, born in Constantinople and educated in London, founded <italic>Commercial Bank of Greece</italic> in 1905, later joined by his brother-in-law, Dimitrious Petrokokkinos, a Rodocanachi and Ralli cousin who was born and educated in London. \nTo distribute railway, electrification, and other public work deals in Morocco from 1902, <italic>Paribas</italic> organized a consortium including <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic>, <italic>Commerce et L\u2019Industrie</italic>, and soon extended to <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Indochine</italic>. But as Germany challenged growing French control in Morocco, Britain\u2019s Cassel established the note-issuing <italic>Bank of Morocco</italic> to support France. France aimed to secure control of Morocco in exchange for permitting Britain to take Egypt, while Germany pushed for free trade and an open-door policy. Although French banks were involved in the negotiations, they excluded <italic>Creuset</italic> from the discussions: \nWhile Germany sought to extend <italic>ORIENT</italic> into oil-rich Iraq supported by Dutch bankers in 1903 until Britain\u2019s new protectionist Minister dissuaded Cassel<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic><italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>London partnership,<italic> </italic>the soon-to-be <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>, from participating. As France sought to colonize Morocco, tensions escalated between France and Germany in the <italic>Tangier Crisis of 1905</italic> until European powers backed France in 1906.\nIn 1905, <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic> received a concession to establish <italic>Bank of Abyssinia</italic>. While the founding committee included three Brits, three Italians, and a German, the bank primarily had British interests and personnel, despite efforts to internationalize the venture. When BOE raised rates following California\u2019s earthquake, Egypt\u2019s cotton real estate boom deflated, forcing BOE to bailout the landbank <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Parisienne</italic> had dispatched Maurice Millet from France as her first permanent Egyptian representative, scandal after the Egyptian crisis of 1907 led her to replace him with Rene Ismalun, a Cattaui in-law with Austrian citizenship. As colonial central banks formed in German East Africa, Togo, and Cameroon, <italic>British South Africa Co</italic> occupied Southern Rhodesia with hopes of mineral wealth. Lack of such led them to turn into \u2018White agricultural policy\u2019 from 1907, exploiting land and labor for the White economy.\nWhile Ethiopian Empress Taytu rivaled <italic>Bank of Abyssinia</italic>\u2019s monopoly by forming <italic>Society for the Promotion of Agriculture & Trade</italic> in 1909, it lasted only one year. As a rift formed between <italic>Bank of Abyssinia</italic> and <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic> over the latter\u2019s commitment to British interests, Ethiopia\u2019s rulers continued investing, as Emperor Menilek lent money to Indian traders, Empress Taytu owned Addis Ababa\u2019s first hotel, and other royals invested in cinemas, taxis, and water. \nLikewise, Parsee and Jewish Sassoon challenged the British Christian dominated banks in India. Significant Indian joint-stock banks emerged only after 1906, with Punjab National Bank. Likewise, Cowasjee Jehangir, Shapoorji Bharucha, RD Tata, and David Sassoon founded Bank of India the same year. By 1910, Sassoon organized Eastern Bank to bank East Indian businesses. Within a year, Parsee businessmen and David Sassoon established the private Central Bank of India in Bombay, one of the largest Indian-controlled private joint-stock banks. Soon after Bank of Madras and Bank of Bengal appointed Indian directors. \nOut of Beirut, the Levantine Christian Crispin-in-law Malhame controlled Ottoman finances. In 1894, Salim Malhame held shares in <italic>Beirut-Damascus</italic> RR and <italic>Beirut Port</italic>, both completed that year. Since Malhame became Director General in the Ottoman Ministry of Mines, Forests, & Agriculture, where he negotiated concessions in the 1880s, some of which he granted to his brothers, such one to Najib for drinking-water distribution in Beirut in 1901. While they may have personally benefited from the sale of a forestry concession, not all ventures were successful. \nWhen Habib Malhame joined with <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>\u2019s William d\u2019Arcy to develop Iraqi oil fields in 1901, d\u2019Arcy failed to secure investment for both. Habib advanced in the tobacco monopoly, Turkey\u2019s largest corporation, before becoming a senior officer in the Ministry of Police. By 1906, Najib secured a concession for a tramway and electricity in Beirut, which was floated in Brussels and Constantinople being acquired by<italic> Beirut Gas Co </italic>for a million <italic>francs</italic>. Philippe transitioned from imperial inspector for public works to councilor of state for finance. Over the next few years, Salim\u2019s daughters married aristocratic German military advisors.\nEarlier, <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s foray into Galician Boryslaw\u2019s oil industry crashed European prices from overproduction, growing fears of ruinous competition from 1904. While Hirsch-affiliated<italic> </italic><italic>Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Austrian </italic><italic>Bank</italic> and the Offenheim and Biedermann families reorganized Anglo-Austrian oil investments, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> restructured the oil-focused <italic>Galician Bank for Trade </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Industry</italic>. \nAfter initiating involvement in Romanian and Galician oil ventures in 1903, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> allied against <italic>OIL</italic> with <italic>Shell</italic> and formed <italic>Deutsche </italic>Petroleum<italic> </italic>in 1904 as a HC for firms in Galicia (<italic>Schodnica</italic>), Romania (<italic>Star</italic>), and Russia (<italic>Kasbek</italic>). While competing with <italic>Deutsche </italic>in Constantinople,<italic> Wiener</italic> invested in <italic>Deutsche </italic>Petroleum. <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der </italic>acquired the British <italic>Bustenarii</italic> and French <italic>Telega</italic> to form <italic>Concordia</italic>. By 1905, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, <italic>Bohrgesellschaft</italic>,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Parisienne</italic> established <italic>Regatul Romana</italic>.\nConcurrently, with <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s support, Britain defeated Russia for Persia. As Persia became Iran, <italic>Shell</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and <italic>Deutsche </italic>cartelized Eurasian oil to lock in <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> and lock out <italic>OIL</italic> and Russia by 1906. That year, <italic>Deutsche Bank </italic>led <italic>European Petroleum Union</italic> to unite Russian, Austrian Galician, and Romanian cartelize oil producers and consolidate selling. <italic>Shell</italic> soon handled Persia\u2019s loan to join <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>\u2019s board. From the family representing <italic>W\u00fcrttemberg Court Bank</italic> since 1802, Maurice Hirsch\u2019s cousin Albert Kaulla led the extension of <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR into Iraq on behalf of <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s syndicate.\nWith the oil cartel of 1906, <italic>Deutsche </italic>secured an extension for <italic>ORIENT </italic>to Iraqi for oil and hydroelectric utilities, limiting further disruptive coal strikes. Since Austrian coal strikes extended the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic>, Cassel reorganized <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> in 1906, Bohemian coal-magnate and Wertheim cousin-in-law Ignaz Petschek bought into the venture. \nMaurice Hirsch\u2019s cousin of Alfred Kaulla, a grand nephew of <italic>W\u00fcrttemberg Court Bank</italic>\u2019s Chaile, led the extension of <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR into Iraq on behalf of <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>. That year, <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic>, in which Kaulla also had an interest, took over <italic>W\u00fcrttemberg Court Bank.</italic><italic> </italic>The banks incorporated under the leadership of Stuttgart banker and <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> cousin-in-law Alex Pflaum, who had been instrumental in the founding of <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic> (1869) and <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Notenbank</italic> (1871).\nAs <italic>Shell</italic> and <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> merged, Robert Waley, the grandson of Nathaniel Cohen-Barent and Jacob Waley\u2014cousins of Rothschild, Samuel, and Katz\u2014played a key role in the amalgamation, becoming a director in 1907 and later chair of the British entity, <italic>Anglo-Saxon Petroleum </italic>(\u201c<italic>Shell</italic> Britain\u201d). Since <italic>Shell</italic> remained a dually-owned company, with <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> owning 60%, and <italic>Rothchild</italic> London and <italic>Samuel </italic>being large investors in <italic>Shell</italic> Britain, Vivian and his cousin Abel Smyth soon linked the <italic>Shell</italic>, <italic>Samuel,</italic> and <italic>Burma</italic> oil ventures. \nSince <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, and <italic>Berliner</italic> incorporated Bucharest oil investment bank<italic> Marmorosch </italic>a syndicate led by <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Wiener</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Anversois</italic>, and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Li\u00e9geois</italic> funded Bucharest Jewish <italic>Halfon</italic> and Greek <italic>Chrissoveloni</italic> of Chios and <italic>Economos</italic> of Trieste in buying <italic>Belgian-Romanian Credit</italic> and forming <italic>Romanian Commercial Bank </italic>in 1906. \nOver the following two years, Anglo- and Germano-Greek banks allied. Founded by Anglo-Greek interests, <italic>Commercial Bank of Greece</italic> became a joint-stock company in 1908 with shares purchased by <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic>-funded<italic> Bank of Athens</italic>, and <italic>Rodocanachi </italic>London. Her board included N.S. Serbos, former manager of <italic>Lyonnais</italic> Odessa, M.I. Politis, an MP and Chair of <italic>Athens-Piraeus</italic> RR. And representing German interests, <italic>Nationalbank</italic> and <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>funded <italic>Banque d\u2019Orient</italic> saw her director, German descendant Georges Streit, the son of the Governor of <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, marry a Carath\u00e9odory relative of the Rodocanachi, Zarifi, and Baltazzi families in 1908.\nImperial competition extended to the Americas. Starting with the formation of <italic>London Bank of Mexico </italic>as a local corporation to include expatriate French financiers in 1889, <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic> converted her foreign branches into locally incorporated banks and retained shareholdings, shifting toward functioning as an investment trust. By 1897, <italic>London Bank</italic>\u2019s Lima branch merged with <italic>Callao</italic> to form <italic>London Bank of Peru</italic>. <italic>London Bank</italic> also acquired positions in <italic>Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires</italic>, <italic>Banco de la Habana Cuba</italic>, <italic>Banco Agricola Comercial San Salvador</italic>, <italic>Banco de la Nacion Boliviana</italic>, and <italic>Banco Espa\u00f1ol de Chile</italic>.\nAlong with reforming silver in 1904, Mexico\u2019s issued debt via <italic>Speyer</italic> New York, <italic>Speyer</italic> London, <italic>Speyer</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, <italic>Teixeira</italic> of Amsterdam, and <italic>Banco Nacional de M\u00e9xico</italic> to buy controlling interests in <italic>Southern</italic> RR and <italic>Veracruz & Pacific</italic> RR and to fund public works at Coatzacoalcos, Salina Cruz, Veracruz, and Manzanillo ports.\nAs France increased her Mexican presence, Anglo-German financiers risked being sidetracked. <italic>Salomon</italic>, among the most prominent Mexican oil financiers, was founded by <italic> </italic>Haim Salomon\u2019s Alabama-born great-grandson William Salomon, a cousin of the Hendricks and Hart families, worked closely with <italic>Speyer</italic>. By 1904, <italic>Salomon</italic> hired Elisha Walk, a Christian born in New York to London merchants. Walk studied at <italic>Yale</italic> and MIT before joining <italic>Fisk </italic>in 1902 until 1904, when he married the daughter of a Martinque sugar planter descended from French aristocrat, and moved to <italic>Salomon</italic>, where he developed his oil financing acumen.\nThe same year as founding <italic>Orientbank</italic><italic> </italic>in 1905, <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>and <italic>Dresdner</italic> raised capital and co-founded <italic>Sudamerikanische Bank</italic> in Berlin to promote German commerce with South America with initial branches in Hamburg, Buenos Aires, and Mexico. By 1907, <italic>Deutsche</italic> and <italic>Speyer</italic> established <italic>German-American Bank</italic> in Mexico, which the Mexican government granted a 40-year concession and 25 years of tax exemptions. In Berlin, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, <italic>Berenberg Gossler</italic>, <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic>, and <italic>Union Bank of Hamburg</italic> founded <italic>America Bank</italic>, involving financial houses in major German, European, and American cities.\nAlso in 1907, <italic>London Bank of Peru</italic> reformed its statutes to allow foreign control, mainly British, and issued shares the Paris Bourse with backing from <italic>Banque Commerce et l'industrie</italic> and <italic>London Bank of Mexico</italic>, marking the first Peruvian stock listing in Paris since 1879. <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> acquired stakes in this issue and, by 1908, controlled the concession to operate Callao\u2019s docks. \nFrench pressure increased French board representation, and replacing a German director in 1909. In 1909, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> helped <italic>London Bank of Peru</italic> displace German creditors in a large loan to Peru secured by salt tax revenues. In 1912, <italic>Anglo-South American Bank</italic>\u2014the former <italic>Bank of Tarapaca</italic>\u2014absorbed <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic>, extending <italic>Anglo-South</italic>\u2019s reach across Mexico, Peru, Argentina, San Salvador, Bolivia, Chile, and Cuba.\nMeanwhile, as the Old Believer of the <italic>Moscow Exchange Committee</italic> advocated for the merchant class to assert political leadership in industrial Russia, <italic>Morozov</italic> and other Old Believers unified in political goals. After the death of her son in 1905, Maria remained involved in <italic>Morozov</italic> and <italic>Nikolskaia Manufactory</italic>. Before her death in 1911, Maria joined with her daughter to donate large amounts\u2014including poor houses, a mental health hospital in honor of her son, and an Old Believer hospital\u2014that led to her being the only Russian merchant\u2019s wife to receive an imperial award for 25 years of service. Maria\u2019s daughter followed her lead to fund charities and participate in public life against social mores. \nWhen <italic>Moscow Merchants Bank</italic>\u2019s chair died in 1903, Maria\u2019s son-in-law Grigori Krestovnikov assumed leadership. Descending from Old Believer merchants of peasant origin like Morozov, he owned a Moscow cotton mill and a Kazan chemical plant. Succeeding his father-in-law, Krestovnikov became head of <italic>Moscow Stock Exchange</italic> in 1905 and represented commerce and industry in the State Council on Elections from 1906. Under his leadership, the bank branched to Central Asia to supply Moscow mills with cotton. While Krestovnikov soon became a hereditary noble, <italic>Moscow Merchant Bank</italic> fell to 8th place in 1908 eight years after being the second largest bank in Russia. Fellow Old Believer-led Baku-oil focused <italic>Volga-Kama Bank</italic> remained the largest, but soon dropped to 6th place. \nLosses during the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic> spurred the <italic>Russian Revolution of 1905</italic>. As Savva Morozov\u2019s nephew died in police custody, his mother Maria had him declared insane in May 1905. Losing control of his assets, Savva apparently committed suicide two days later, although his nieces\u2014who also donated to the Bolsheviks\u2014suspected Leonid Krasin of involvement. Having witnessed the shooting on the \u2018Bloody Sunday\u2019 in Saint-Petersburg, Krasin questioned Lenin\u2019s position. Despite health issues, Rosa Luxemburg remained active in her political work and was imprisoned for her participation in the revolution. Notwithstanding liberalization since the <italic>Crimea War</italic> in 1857, only this revolution spurred the Tsar to end his autocratic rule. \nAmidst the revolutionary crisis, <italic>Rawicz</italic><italic>\u2014</italic>Warsaw\u2019s oldest private bank\u2014suspended payments. On January 5, her head Wladyslaw Rawicz went abroad and, unable to find financing, announced his suicide. The procurator committed suicide. In Berlin the firm\u2019s representative attempted suicide. The bankruptcy caused the closure of several Warsaw factories and the loss of savings held by aristocrats, priests, merchants, and small investors.\nWithout access to Morozov\u2019s financing anymore, Krasin engaged in a failed counterfeiting attempt in 1907. Lenin, accusing him of embezzlement and withholding donations from Savva Morozov\u2019s nephew, severed ties with Krasin. Despite securing a position with GGE in Berlin, he was terminated when the forgery scandal was exposed. Krasin then found employment with <italic>Siemens Schuckert</italic>, while Lenin faced scrutiny for his fundraising methods and suppressed an investigation.\nKrasin worked for <italic>Siemens </italic>in Berlin before being transferred to Russia. Initially a salesman, he later became the commercial manager of <italic>Siemens</italic> Moscow and boosted its sales by outfitting regional factories. Recognizing his achievements, he was promoted to General Manager of the Russian headquarters, <italic>Siemens</italic> Saint-Petersburg, where he organized manufacturing and assembly operations to meet the surging demand of the rapidly industrializing Russian market. As Krasin left in 1912, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Electrique</italic>, and a French streetcar firm agreed to construct and operate public transportation in Saint-Peterburg.\nAt the same time, a Russian commission on the causes of the <italic>Revolution of 1905</italic> blamed Bukharan Jews for instigating Muslims, and confined them to a <italic>Pale</italic> in Turkestan. As Russia appointed an antisemitic governor who expelled Jews without legal residency, surveillance and persecution spread. Moisey Flaxman expanded his cotton cleaning plants in Bukhara. By 1907, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>organized a metal and coal cartel in Ukraine. After a Ministry of Finance proposal aimed to regulate private banking in 1907, Polyakov and Brodsky\u2019s banks from Kiew to Bukhara consolidated in 1908.\nAfter overcoming the depressing effects of the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic>, rapid growth resumed in Russia. Mixed investment-deposit banks resumed channeling private capital into dynamic industries and receiving government subsidies. The industrial syndicate emerged as the instrument for combating economic crises. Nevertheless, during this period, the banking sector saw the rapid growth of banking monopolies. \nBy 1908, the six largest banks controlled over half of the sector, and banks with significant liabilities grew substantially. As Brodsky started<italic> Odessa Merchant Bank </italic>in 1911, joint-stock commercial banks expanded rapidly, with their assets nearly tripling by 1913. With consolidation of BHCs, Lenin called them a \u2018ready-made tool\u2019 for establishing and administrating Marxism. But even heiress Elena Stasova was exiled in Siberia from 1913.\nFollowing her defeat in the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic> and the <italic>Revolution of 1905</italic>, Russia grew closer to France and Britain, laying the groundwork for the <italic>Triple Entente</italic>. In 1906, France restructured her military agreement with Russia, focusing on countering Germany. Through his French agent Artur Levinsohn Rafalovich, Witte floated a large loan, with investors including <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic>. Likewise, Edward Baring and Edward Grey, a cousin-in-law of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Edward Grenfell, secured British participation in the 1906 loan, facilitating the rapprochement with the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907. By early 1907, Walter Morgan Burns\u2014John Morgan\u2019s nephew and partner of the London partnership\u2014married a Cavendish cousin of the Smyths and Grenfells.\nAmong the biggest winners of the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic> was arms dealer Basil Zaharoff. Born to a notary and commodity dealer in Constantinople, Zaharoff was descended from Salonica Greeks and was related to prominent traders, including Greek oil shipping banker <italic>Zarifi</italic> of Constantinople and Marseille. He entered the arms trade in 1877, working for <italic>Anglo-Swedish Nordenfelt</italic>. Zaharoff sold submarines to Greece in 1885 and to Turkey in 1886. In 1888, he facilitated the merger of <italic>Nordenfelt</italic> with <italic>Maxim</italic>, armament manufacturers. \nEntering banking, he co-founded a bureau de change<italic> </italic>in Paris in 1891 and in 1897 helped sell <italic>Maxim</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Nordenfelt</italic> into British <italic>Vickers</italic> in a deal closed by Ernest Cassel to create Britain\u2019s leading ship and arms engineer. As the General Representative for <italic>Vickers</italic> abroad, Zaharoff expanded business in Spain, Russia, and Latin America, selling arms during the <italic>Boer War</italic>. He became a French citizen in 1908 and a <italic>Parisienne</italic> shareholder.\nZaharoff faced competition from Cassel<italic> </italic>aligned interests. Although <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Saint-Petersburg shuttered in 1892, Goldschmidt-in-law Solomon Gunzburg reopened <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Paris but committed suicide in 1905. Still, the family continued soon revived the bank and expanded their presence. Solomon\u2019s son Jean<italic> </italic>Goldschmidt Gunzburg<italic> </italic>married a daughter of Paris banker <italic>Louis</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Hirsch</italic>, which he soon led for several decades. \nJean\u2019s sister Marguerita married Robert Bauer in 1907. Since Bauer\u2019s father Raphael worked at <italic>Bischoffsheim Hirsch</italic> and married the daughter of <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent, <italic>Lambert</italic>, by 1867, he became the head of <italic>Paribas</italic> Brussels.<italic> </italic>Having joined <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 board in 1895, Robert became Sous Directeur of <italic>Paribas</italic> Brussels in 1908. And their cousin Jacques Gunzburg moved to London, where he joined <italic>Hirsch</italic>, as Moritz Hirsch\u2019s cousin had married Gunzburg\u2019s Rosenberg cousin once removed. \nWhile Cassel took over <italic>Hirsch</italic> after Moritz Hirsch died in 1896, Edouard Go\u00fcin\u2014rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> heir whose grandmother was a Rodrigues and second-cousin twice removed was a Chair of <italic>Paribas</italic><italic></italic>\u2014and Jacques Gunzburg led the bank by 1909. That year, they led a rebooted <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>, overseeing the capital increase of <italic>Russian Bank of Commerce & Industry </italic>and <italic>Railway </italic><italic>Manufacturing of </italic><italic>Lodz</italic>, and railway ventures. Along with <italic>Thalmann</italic><italic> </italic>Paris,<italic> </italic><italic>Loste</italic><italic> </italic>(descended from a Bordeaux notary), <italic>Hirsch</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> acquired the teering <italic>Saint-Petersburg Private Commercial Bank</italic> teetered, with aid from the Ministry of Finance. \nBy 1910, <italic>Syndicate for Russian Affairs</italic> formed as an alliance of <italic>Parisienne</italic>, SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Hirsch</italic>, <italic>Thalmann</italic><italic> </italic>Paris, and <italic>Creusot</italic>\u2019s<italic> Schneider</italic> to share information and coordinate operations in Russia. After consolidating three Polyakov banks into <italic>Moscow Union Bank</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic> led a capital increase for <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 M\u00e9tallurgique Donetz-Yuryansk </italic>and co-founded <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Embranchements de Chemins de Fer </italic>and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Russe de </italic><italic>Construction</italic> for railway investments. Likewise, <italic>Hirsch</italic> led a capital increase for <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mtallurgique de Taganrog</italic>.\nAlthough not part of the Triple Entente, Belgian <italic>Paribas</italic> and SG <italic>Belge</italic> cooperated closely with French bankers. SG <italic>Belge</italic>\u2019s rival, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, joined other banks in financing Russian tramway and electricity firms, which traded on <italic>Brussels Stock Exchange</italic>, from Bialystock to Odessa, including Poland, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Bessarabia.\nAs a Halphen cousin married a Morpurgo Cah\u00e9n\u2014who became a director in Spanish minier <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic> and a Ukrainian gem and coal miner\u2014her niece, the daughter of oil refiner Emile Deutsch-Meurthe, married Indian-born Sassoon cousin Edward Ezra and Emile\u2019s niece wed a Weisweiller in 1907 before Gunzburg married Emile\u2019s daughter in 1909. From this period, <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya </italic>expanded outside of Spain. \nThe same year, Beatrice Rothschild\u2019s cousin Maurice married No\u00e9mie Halphen, a Goudchoux and Katz-cousin of the Pereire, Fould, and Oppenheim families. As the son of Julius Baer of Swiss bank <italic>Baer</italic> and German engine producer MAN married a Halpern\u2014in-laws of the Gunzburg and Hirsch families\u2014in 1911, Baer\u2019s second cousin once removed marred <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic>\u2019s Moritz Ladenburg\u2019s granddaughter.\n<italic>Loste</italic> also co-founded <italic>Russo</italic><italic>-French Bank</italic><italic> </italic>with Dmitri Rubinshtein of Zhitomir. Of no known relation to the Polyakov-affiliated Rubinsteins, he married a daughter of Kharkov a grain merchant who paid for his law education. Rubinshtein then became President of <italic>Saint-Petersburg Private Commercial Bank</italic>. He held power of attorney for Grand Duke Andrei Romanov and paid the rent for courtier Grigori Rasputin that year.\nThe <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic> and the <italic>Russian Revolution</italic> spurred Russia sought to rebuild her military and modernize industrial operations. Four years after buying an equity stake, <italic>Russo-</italic><italic>Chinese Bank</italic> merged with the <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> owned <italic>Northern Bank</italic> to form <italic>Banque Russo-Asiatique</italic>, which became Russia\u2019s richest the bank, with over 100 branches and investments in petroleum, mining, and railways, especially from Ukraine through China, under the leadership of a Christian former Ministry official.\nThe first President of <italic>Russo-Asiatique</italic> was Saint-Petersburg arms manufacturer Aleksi Putilov of <italic>Putilov Works</italic>. As Austrian<italic> Creditanstalt</italic>-allied <italic>\u0160koda</italic> bought shares of <italic>Putilov</italic>, <italic>Krupp</italic> and <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> sought control of <italic>Putilov</italic>, heightening tensions with France. In response, <italic>Creusot</italic> provided funding to maintain French influence alongside <italic>Russo-Asiatique</italic>. Zaharoff, who had stakes in <italic>Parisienne</italic>, maintained connections with <italic>Creusot</italic> and <italic>Krupp</italic>. Through Zaharoff, British <italic>Vickers</italic> secured contracts with <italic>Saint-Petersburg Ironworks</italic> and <italic>Franco-Russian Co</italic>. In 1913, Zaharoff helped establish <italic>Russian Artillery Works Co</italic> in Zarizyn. By then, <italic>Vickers</italic> was one of the largest arms producers, handling over 20% of British arms exports.\nSince becoming President of <italic>Saint-Petersburg Private Commercial Bank</italic>, within a year, Dmitri Rubinshtein was arrested for financial fraud. Siberian Christian Nikolai Vtorov then bought<italic> Junker Bank</italic>, which he renamed <italic>Moscow Industrial Bank</italic> with financing from British <italic>Midland</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> London. Of unknown relation to Rubinshtein, Grigorii Rubinstein, relied on his Polyakov wife\u2019s dowry to manage debts as more banks branched to Kharkov and <italic>Azov-Don Commercial Bank</italic> encountered instability. \nA likely relation of the Epstein and Polyakov families, Efim Epsteen served as a non-executive director of <italic>Azov-Don </italic>at the time. After listing her shares on the Berlin and Paris stock exchanges in 1910 and 1911, <italic>Azov-Don</italic> bought a large <italic>Bank of Northern Countries </italic>stake and listed on <italic>Saint-Petersburg Stock Exchange</italic>. Likewise, Swede Knut Wallenberg formed <italic>Bank of Northern Countries </italic>in Paris as <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>\u2019s branch with <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Horace Finaly as a director in 1911. \nAfter seizing land and some of <italic>Eastern Chinese</italic> RR from Russia in the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic>, Japan nationalized railways to centralize connections with Korea and Chinese Manchuria from 1906 and cartelized and subsidized shipping from 1907 and engaged in price war with <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s Euro-Chinese conference. While concerns over monopolistic electric pricing led Japan\u2019s Communications Ministry to seek state controls and authorization to set rates in 1909, the Diet weakened supervision in favor of competition in 1911. As utilities competed aggressive and introduced hydro generation and high voltage transmission, rates fell. Since organizing a loan for <italic>Co Orientale de Colonisation</italic> in 1908, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> sponsored <italic>French Japanese Bank</italic> with <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Paris in 1912.\nSince the 1820s, local remittance banks (\u201c<italic>piaohao</italic>\u201d) expanded nationwide, offering secure and efficient services at low fees, crucial amidst rising banditry risks. Centralized under a system with head offices in Shanxi province, <italic>piaohao</italic>\u2019s reputation for reliability made them essential for merchants and governmental revenue transfers, competing with deposit-taking banking. But the continuing influence of Confucian clans impeded financial development. Locales with stronger clans had fewer modern banks, indicating that the clan system hindered external financial growth. \nAs Confucius\u2019 direct descendants served as dukes and scholars, the 75th direct descendant, HH Kung, converted to Christianity and sold his family\u2019s remittance service. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, <italic>Royal Dutch</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London funded the creation of <italic>Asiatic Petroleum </italic>in 1902, Kung served as a regional monopoly agent for <italic>Asiatic</italic> and <italic>British Tobacco</italic>. By 1905, China\u2019s first central bank, <italic>Qing Imperial</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>,<italic> </italic>monopolized provincial remittances, straining <italic>piaohao</italic> finances.\nThe success of the Japanese in the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic> strengthened China\u2019s hand in bargaining with Europe. Since King Leo of Belgium and Congo Free State most of Philippines-focused <italic>American China Development </italic>with loans from <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>during the <italic>Spanish-American War</italic>, China became outrage by the sale in 1904. By 1905, <italic>Morgan</italic> sold his shares back to the Chinese government, leaving a substantial financial profit for Leo without control over <italic>Hankow-Canton</italic> RR or the Philippines. \nAfter <italic>Qing Imperial</italic> <italic>Bank </italic>monopolized provincial remittances in 1905, <italic>piaohao</italic> finances deteriorated. While proposing to modernize in 1908, <italic>Shanxi Remittance Bank</italic> faced resistance from conservative <italic>piaohao</italic> elements. By then, China\u2019s <italic>Communications Ministry </italic>formed <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> to redeem Belgian contracted <italic>Beijing-Hankou</italic> RR and consolidate steamship, railway, telegraph, and post. Along with similarly comprador-like <italic>Qing Imperial</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>, <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> grew into China\u2019s largest banks. \nAfter establishing <italic>Eastern Bank</italic> in 1909 with <italic>Sino-Belgian Bank</italic>, <italic>Sassoon</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Brown Shipley</italic>, this large British involvement proved embarrassing for HSBC, which was accused of cooperating with foreign groups while refusing to include other British banks. But as rubber prices plummeted after the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, bankruptcies spread. While <italic>Sassoon</italic> cousin and Mocatta-husband Ely Kadoorie saved many from liquidation, the crisis continued as international ministers convened to delegalize the opium trade in 1909. \nIn 1909, British HSBC, French <italic>Indochine</italic>, and German <italic>Asiatische </italic>banks formed a consortium to fund salt-backed public debt to build <italic>Hukuang</italic> RR. On behalf of the State Department, <italic>Morgan</italic> led a consortium of <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>First</italic> NB o<italic>f New York</italic>, and <italic>Citi</italic> (\u201c<italic>AMERICA</italic>\u201d) actively promoted American investments in China with <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> as the European representative. In 1910, <italic>Asiatische </italic>reported a clerical error after Zhang guaranteed merchant loans without approval. Soon after, <italic>Indochine</italic> stopped credit. After defaults, the German consul asked the Governor-General to register <italic>Asiatische </italic>loans, leading <italic>Indochine</italic> and the newly formed <italic>Russo-Asiatique</italic> to add claims. After the Tianjin proposed rescheduling, <italic>Asiatische </italic>extended the loan by several weeks.  \nHowever, a military uprising in Wuchang started the <italic>Chinese Revolution</italic> of 1911. By year-end 1911, Yat-sen Sun, a Western-educated medical doctor, was elected President in Nanjing. After the Wuchang uprising, the Qing court recalled Shikai Yuan, former Governor-General of Zhili, to lead the Northern Army from Beijing. Under Yuan\u2019s pressure, the Emperor abdicated on February 1912. \nDuring the conflict, branches of <italic>Qing Imperial Bank</italic> and <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> were looted and forced to suspend operations. Sun\u2019s provisional government authorized <italic>Qing </italic>to reorganize into <italic>Bank of China</italic>. Although the Beijing government ordered <italic>Bank of China</italic> to suspend operations in 1912, <italic>Bank of China</italic> Shanghai redeemed banknotes and encouraged merchants to circulate notes. After Sun resigned in March 1912, Yuan was confirmed as President and borrowed heavily from <italic>Bank of Communications</italic>. \nWith the international cartel, HSBC pressed the British Foreign Office to maintain exclusive backing. In 1912, a rival syndicate offered a loan. Lord Grey reaffirmed support for HSBC, blocking <italic>Hambro</italic> and other British banks from entering China. While SG <italic>Belge</italic> consolidated <italic>Sino-Belge Bank</italic> and other regional assets into <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re pour l\u2019Etranger</italic> in 1913, <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Grenfell\u2019</italic>s Edward Grenfell married the daughter of BOE director and Chair of Far East trader <italic>Borneo Co</italic>. \nBy 1915, President Yuan proclaimed himself Emperor and his cousin, Zhenfang Zhang, opened <italic>Yien Yieh Commercial Bank</italic>, an official national bank to manage salt revenue. Yuan had relied on some of the Eight Great Masters of Tianjin who long controlled the northern salt trade, including the Bian, Sun, and Shi families. By 1916, Hsuan Shi graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> Business and became the first Chinese apprentice at <italic>Morgan</italic>. \nFor Finance Minister, Yuan had appointed Xuexi Zhou, son of Li Hongzhang\u2019s deputy, Governor-General Fu Zhou, founded <italic>National Industrial Bank</italic>. After Duosen Sun, nephew of Qing official Jianai Sun and a relative of Hongzhang, started <italic>Zhongfu Bank</italic> in China\u2019s second financial capital Tianjin, his in-law, Baimei Bian, who studied at <italic>Brown</italic><italic> Uni</italic> in America and wed Hanzhang\u2019s grandniece, joined <italic>Zhongfu</italic>. Duosen Sun\u2019s son studied at studied at MIT and <italic>Brown</italic> in America and then became sub-manager of <italic>Bank of China</italic> Hankow in 1914. He later resigned and co-founded <italic>Chung Foo Union Bank</italic>, where he served as Shanghai manager. \nKemin Wang, who headed <italic>Industrial Bank of China</italic>, backed military political leader Guozhang Feng, who in turn supported <italic>Bank of China</italic> manager Danya Tan in founding <italic>Continental Bank </italic>with Yangzhou salt merchants in southern China. While reforms discontinued Chinese <italic>piaohao </italic>remittance services,<italic> piaohao </italic>resisted incorporating as <italic>Shanxi Remittance Bank</italic>, and most contracted and failed. The Chinese native bankers (\u201cqianzhuang\u201d), however, remained small private, partnerships linked by marriage and cross-investment and continued to operate as intermediaries between foreign and Chinese banks.\nIn the Balkans to her west, meanwhile, Russia vied for influence with Austria. Since the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, all attempts to establish banks with foreign capital failed. From 1879, the state-owned <italic>Bulgarian National Bank</italic> became the country\u2019s central bank. Several private joint-stock saving bank companies were established, the most successful of which was <italic>Girdap Bank</italic> in the Danube city of Russe in 1881. \nLikewise, Russe banker Gubidelnikov kinterlinked with the Teodorovs of the <italic>People\u2019s Party</italic>, who forged marriage alliances with merchant bankers Burov and Geshov, a liberal newspaper editor, and other <italic>People\u2019s Party</italic> supporters. While Burov and others also expanded into politics, the families kinterlinked with other political banking clans. \nAs credit companies and small banks spread across Bulgaria, <italic>Commercial & Industrial Bank</italic> became the first joint-stock bank in Plovdiv in 1895. The same year, <italic>Bulgarian Lottery Bank</italic> became the first foreign company to incorporate in Bulgaria, with investment from <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2019s <italic>Bank of Salonica</italic>, <italic>Norddeutsche Bank </italic>of Hamburg, and other German companies. \nAs Bulgarian banking destabilized following the dissolution of <italic>TURK</italic> by 1899, in-laws Gubidelnikov and Burov founded <italic>Targovska Banka</italic> of Sofia, which became the country\u2019s most powerful private bank with investment from <italic>Wiener </italic>and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Parbias</italic> and <italic>Wiener</italic> participated in the Bulgarian loan negotiation, secured by the tobacco monopoly. <italic>Wiener </italic>also collaborated in Serbian government loans.\nFrom 1905, foreigners started three major commercial banks in Bulgaria. <italic>Banque de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> was formed in late 1905 by a group of German banks, including <italic>Disconto</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Norddeutsche Bank</italic>. By yearend, <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> invested in <italic>Targovska Banka</italic>, which grew to five branches. Bulgaria\u2019s primary bank, <italic>Balkanique</italic>, started by 1906, with investment from <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Wiener</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Anversois</italic>. \nAs Gubidelnikov and Burov built <italic>Targovska </italic>with <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> to compete with the liberal <italic>Girdap</italic> for dominance in banking and politics, Burov\u2019s in-law Geshov married Maria Puliev, kinterlinking with co-religionist <italic>Puliev Georgiev</italic> of Romania. And in early 1907, a <italic>Rothschild</italic> London heir wed an ennobled K\u00f6nigswarter Wertheim of Austrian Hungary.\nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, Germany limited cartels to the public interest and legalized security collateralized banknotes. As Austria annexed Bosnia per the <italic>Treaty of Berlin </italic>in 1908, Bulgaria revolted against Turkey. While Austria nationalized her section of <italic>ORIENT</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic> became involved with Bulgaria\u2019s primary bank<italic> Balkanique</italic>. Representing Russo-French interests, <italic>Loste</italic> and <italic>Saint-Petersburg Private Commercial Bank</italic> interests founded a commercial and mortgage bank in Sofia.\nSince British and German coal sold in Saint-Peterburg for a third of prices of Ukrainian coal, the latter found markets in the Balkans, Mediterranean, and South America. Likewise, competition from German steel required Russian firms to operate as half capacity. So as Turkey lost the Balkans, Russian attention shifted to Armenia.\nIn Constantinople at the time, none of the 40 private bankers or 34 stockbrokers were of Turkish descent. Greeks owned 50% and Armenians owned 20% of the 284 industrial firms employing five or more workers. In 1908, the Young Turk reformist rebellion in 1908 accused Salim Malhame of becoming wealthy from corruption, with his daughter marrying a German military advisor for the Sultan and the Young Turks. As elite Macedonian troops mutinied, Muslim fundamentalists called for the reinstatement of Sharia law in early 1909. This counter-revolution led to violence, including the massacre of Armenians. \nBefore formal power returned to the Ottoman parliament, the Young Turks invited British investment, leading Cassel to form <italic>Bank of Turkey</italic> in 1909 and join the<italic> </italic>German<italic> ORIENT</italic>. With funding from <italic>Bank of Turkey</italic>, Calouste Gulbenkian, the Armenian son of Turkey\u2019s Russian oil importer, discovered oil in Iraq. As America\u2019s emissary, President Roosevelt sent <italic>Macy</italic> heir Oscar Straus, who had been a Secretary<italic> </italic>of<italic> </italic>Commerce<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic>Labor, to Turkey. But as French and Austrian electric utilities in Turkey struggled in a drought, they fused under GGE. \nAs GGE developed Alpine hydroelectric monopoly in Germany, <italic>Stinnes</italic> and <italic>Siemens</italic> partnered to reduce waste, German towns and coalers shared in soaring profits as exports rivaled Britain. Likewise, coal magnate <italic>Arnhold</italic> branched to Berlin and kinterlinked with Warburg cousin <italic>Bondi</italic> and other Saxon bankers to connect with industry. Soon after, in London, <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> heir Thomas Merton\u2014a brother in-law of Katz descendant Cohen-Barent and <italic>Wagg </italic>families\u2014married Violet Sawyer\u2014an extended cousin of the Lascelles, Baring, and Smyth families\u2014in 1913.\nIn 1908, <italic>Shell</italic> entered the Romanian market by establishing <italic>Astra</italic>. Initially considering cartel proposals from <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s <italic>Star</italic>, <italic>Shell</italic> later pursued independent development. By 1910, <italic>Shell</italic> acquired <italic>Regatul Roman</italic>, forming <italic>Astra Romana</italic>, the second-largest company in Romania, trailing only <italic>Star</italic>.  Likewise, to drive industrial investment in Galicia like cr\u00e9dit mobiliers, <italic>Austrian L\u00e4nderbank</italic> and a group of oil miners established <italic>Bank Ludowy</italic> in Lemberg in 1910. The same year, <italic>Przemys</italic><italic>l</italic><italic>owy</italic> started with investment from the government of Galicia, Lemberg, and Krakau as well as from <italic>Lower Austrian Discount</italic><italic> Bank</italic>.\nAs with Galicia, Jewish entrepreneurs transformed Bukovina from the 19th century. While nationalization efforts in Bukovina attempted to exclude Jews from the prominent timber industry led by Leo Popper, they failed as state-backed enterprises collapsed. By the turn of the century, Popper and other Jews formed joint-stock timber companies. Jews were integral to the region\u2019s industrial and trade activities, dominating distilleries, operating 53 of 61 establishments, and breweries, running 4 of 7. \nGalician Jews also controlled all 6 mineral oil refineries and were active in the wood, milling, and sugar industries. The region's timber and cattle trade flourished, with local traders mediating commerce between Romania, Russia, and Western markets. Jews owning 28 out of 34 sawmills. Since gaining the right to buy Bukovina estates in the 1860s, Jews were involved in 42% of noble-owned 42% and with 85% of all Bukovina\u2019s estates by 1910.\nAs with insurers<italic> Phoenix</italic>, <italic>Assieuracioni Generali</italic>, <italic>Reunione Adriatica</italic>, and <italic>Nordatern</italic>, most of Czernowitz\u2019s domestic and foreign bankers were Jewish. <italic>Bank of Bukovina </italic>was Czernowitz\u2019s largest bank. It offered mortgage loans and financed railway and construction companies. Other notable banks included <italic>Bukovina Trade & Crafts Bank</italic> of 1895, and <italic>Bukovina Regional Bank </italic>of 1905, providing long-term loans to peasants. \nCzernowitz also hosted <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austro-Hungarian Bank</italic>, <italic>Austro-German Savings Bank</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, and <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic> branches. <italic>Mercur </italic><italic>Bank</italic> and other Austrian banks had offices in the city. With booming real estate, Czernowitz had over 217 financial institutions by the early 20th century. By 1906, the Empire established <italic>Bukovina National Bank</italic> in Czernowitz, following the example of <italic>Galician National Bank</italic>, which engaged in investment banking beyond mortgage credit.\nBy 1910, <italic>Deutsche </italic>acquired <italic>Hirsch</italic>\u2019s Galician assets to split production with <italic>Rothschild</italic>-affiliated <italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic>. While<italic> L\u00e4nderbank</italic> and oil-miners founded <italic>Galician People's Bank for Agriculture </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Trade</italic> in Lemberg. In the same city, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>-affiliated <italic>Industrial Bank for the Kingdom of Galicia </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Lodomeria</italic> financed cement, machinery, oil, food-processing, and other industries from 1911. While <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> had restructured <italic>Galician Bank for Trade </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Industry</italic> in 1905, <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic> gained control. \nSince <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> director Arnold Rappaport\u2019s children married to London banker Robert Allatini and <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s Lieben-in-law Albrecht Schey at the turn of the century, another son, Alfred, developed Hungarian coal mines. By 1911, Alfred wed the daughter of a <italic>Nationalbank</italic> director and a niece of Eugen Lando.  Since <italic>Commerzbank </italic>co-founded <italic>Nationalbank</italic> under Eugen\u2019s father Jacob in 1881, <italic>Nationalbank</italic> and Lando financed Rathenau\u2019s GGE several years later. Back in the 1870s, Eugen\u2019s sister married to Ludwig Asser Kaufmann, a baptized second great grandson of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, a nephew-in-law of <italic>Oppenheim </italic>Cologne, and nephew-in-law of  Cologne-born Robert Esser, who soon chaired <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>and <italic>Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Bodenkreditbank</italic>, and served on the boards of thirteen others, including <italic>Dresdner</italic>.\nAlso in 1911, Eugen\u2019s stepson, Curt Sobernheim became a <italic>Commerzbank</italic> director. Likewise, third cousins once removed of Arnold Rappaport, Lemberg-born brothers Julius and Siegfried Rappaport Landesberger married sisters, who had descended from Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and were cousins of the Liebens, in the 1890s. While Siegfried became Procurator of <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic>, Julius became President of <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> in 1913.\nAt the time, Turkish Bosnian economic development surpassed landlocked Serbia and coal-poor Bulgaria by three and five times, respectively. Along with large-scale production and advanced industrialization, Bosnia outperformed her Balkan neighbors in transportation, communication, and foreign trade. \nPossibly to prevent Russian intrusion, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna controlled Serbian foreign investment for nearly three decades from 1882. <italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic>, an affiliate of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna after the <italic>Panic of 1882</italic>, controlled <italic>Serbian Credit Bank</italic>. <italic>Andrejevi\u0107</italic> also formed that year and established business ties with <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, linked to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna through Ulman. \nWhile<italic> Parisienne </italic>shareholder <italic>Mirabaud</italic> created <italic>Mines de Bor</italic> to develop Serbian metallurgy in the country\u2019s largest industrial investment in 1904, Serbia remained underbanked. This changed after 1908 as <italic>Andrejevi</italic><italic>\u0107</italic> converted into a joint-stock bank with investment from <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Berliner </italic>under bank manager Maximilian Oppenheim, taking the lead from <italic>Serbian Credit</italic>. By 1910, <italic>TURK</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Mirabaud</italic>, and other French banks founded<italic> Franco-Serbian Bank</italic> (\u201cBFS\u201d).\nAs <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> expanded in Serbia, her <italic>Romanian Credit</italic> doubled her capital through the acquisition of <italic>Lower Austrian Discount Bank</italic>\u2019s <italic>Dickin</italic><italic> </italic>in 1908. In 1913, <italic>Romanian Credit</italic>, along with <italic>Marmorosch</italic> and <italic>Romanian Commercial Bank</italic>, subscribed to a Romanian state loan. If Belgrade banks had similar transaction sizes to <italic>Marmorosch</italic>\u2014also with <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Berliner </italic>investment\u2014and several Bucharest banks, most had limited involvement. While 10% of Serbian enterprises became joint-stock firms and contributed 30% of industrial output by 1913, nearly a third of Romanian industrial enterprises became joint-stock and contributed over 60% of industrial production.\nInstead, several Jewish bankers led many Serbian banks. David Alkalai, Benzion Buli, Isaac Azriel, Nachman Amar, and Adolf Reshovsky founded <italic>Belgrade Commercial Savings </italic>in 1893 and <italic>Serbian Bank</italic> began in 1906 with shareholders including Jacob Azriel, Mita Azriel, Elias Levi, Josif Levi, and Moshe Amar. In 1911, David Levi, Reshovsky, Isaac Levi, Josif Alkalai, Jacques Buli, and Nachman Levi formed the joint-stock<italic> Colonial</italic>. By 1912, Edja Buli inherited his father\u2019s bank and became the \u2018Serbian Rothschild\u2019, served in Parliament. To finance trade, Reshovsky and David Levi formed<italic> </italic><italic>Saobracajna</italic>, with directors including Isaac Levi, Josif Alkalai, Jacques Buli, Nachman Levi, Samuel Amar, Max Alkalai, and Jacob Haim. Michael Levi, and Jacques Buli started <italic>Fatherland</italic> with <italic>Hungarian Creditbank </italic>and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>. \nBy 1900, <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> controlled provincial banks from Moravia to Transylvania, while <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic> controlled <italic>Croatian Creditbank</italic>. Among Croatia\u2019s most important Jewish bankers were the Zanders of Burgenland, on Austro-Hungarian border, where Jews settled after their expulsion in the 17th century. While Jacob Zander wed a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, his brothers moved to Zagreb in 1851. Jonas was a grain wholesaler and worked with <italic>Croatian Cooperative </italic>and <italic>Zagreb Savings</italic>. Jonas\u2019 son Samuel married an Eiger cousin of the Katz and Louri\u00e9 families, managed <italic>Sisak Brewery</italic> from 1880, helped found <italic>Zagreb Stock Exchange</italic> in 1907, and was a <italic>Croatian Discount </italic>director. Jonas\u2019 son Sandor was a shareholder in <italic>Croatian Machine Factory</italic>, <italic>Iron Foundry</italic>, <italic>Bank for Commerce, Trade </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Industry</italic>, <italic>Croatian Credit</italic><italic>b</italic><italic>ank</italic>, <italic>Croatian Bank of Commerce</italic>, <italic>Croatian Trust</italic>, and <italic>Trading Bank of Zagreb</italic>.\nLike they did in Algeria and Tunisia, Livornese Jews connected Libya to Europe. Leading Tripoli\u2019s Jewish community by the 18th century, the Nahum and Arbib families moved to Britain and marry partnering with cousin-in-laws of one another, the Tunisian Cesana, and Egyptian Mosseri families to trade African goods and English cloth from the 1870s. Kinterlinking with the Sassoon, Cattaui, and Lumbroso Boccara families around 1907, <italic>Arbib</italic> initiated the expansion of <italic>Banco di Roma</italic>, followed by <italic>Nahum</italic><italic> </italic>adopting a similar strategy with<italic> Italian Colonial Society</italic>. By 1911, Italy had occupied Libya. \nWith the outbreak of the <italic>Turkish-Italian</italic> <italic>War</italic> that year, Greek Salonica expelled the Jewish Morpurgo cousins Allatini and Modiano and other Italian citizens, triggering payment suspension and a regional financial crisis. <italic>Allatini</italic>\u2019s debts mainly stemmed from guarantees by the Marseille branch on transactions of their <italic>Modiano</italic>, worsening the local financial situation. Fortunately, intervention by Italy\u2019s PM secured credit from <italic>Banca d\u2019Italia</italic>, leveraging <italic>Allatini</italic>-owned securities to stabilize the crisis. While the Allatini family fled to France in 1911, their Greek partners managed the mines until Greeks took over ownership.\nThe <italic>Panic of 1911</italic> led to a bank run from the Chiot cousinhood and <italic>Bank of Athens</italic> in October. <italic>Bank of Athens</italic> and <italic>Banque d\u2019Orient</italic> received emergency funds from their partners, with <italic>Parisienne</italic> becoming a controlling shareholder of <italic>Bank of Athens</italic>. <italic>Ottoman Bank</italic> and <italic>Lyonnais</italic> supported these banks, but <italic>Bank of Mitylene</italic>, lacking external support, collapsed into bankruptcy. Despite subsequent challenges, Izmir\u2019s banks stabilized with only <italic>Smyrna Bank</italic> closing in 1914. In Romania, Bulgarian Orthodox Georgiev of <italic>Puliev Georgiev </italic>led the formation of domestically financed and Liberal Party-aligned <italic>Banca Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 </italic>in 1911 to invest in coal, metallurgy, lumber, and petroleum., mirroring Bulgarian political-party aligned <italic>Targovska Banka</italic>, which was kinterlinked with Puliev. \nAfter the <italic>Tangier Crisis of 1905</italic> escalated tensions between France and Germany over Morocco and European powers backed France, France withdrew funds from Germany during the <italic>Agadir Crisis of 1911</italic>, while France and Russia strengthened their gold reserves. In her first large transaction seeking American credit, Germany issued an eighty-million-<italic>mark</italic> loan through <italic>Berliner</italic> and her American agent, <italic>Hallgarten</italic>, as America offered favorable interest rates and New York\u2019s money market remained strong. While Russia shifted her alignment from Germany to France, Austria and Germany grew closer. \nIn the <italic>Balkan Wars</italic> of 1912 and 1913, Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and their allies largely expelled Turkey from Europe. As Albania became independent, Greece gained Crete and Salonica (and greatly increasing her Jewish population), Italy acquired Rhodes, and Austria gained more influence than Russia. While Ernest Cassel made the purchase of arms from <italic>Vickers</italic> a condition of his loans to foreign governments, including to the Ottoman Empire in 1911, soon with financing from <italic>Thalmann</italic> Paris, <italic>Vickers</italic>\u2019 General Representative Basil Zaharoff funds to Greece during the <italic>Balkan Wars</italic> in 1912. \nBy 1912, Turkey\u2019s Gulbenkian sold stakes to 25% <italic>Shell</italic>, 25% <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, and 50% to <italic>Bank of Turkey</italic>. As Cassel yielded British <italic>Bank of Turkey</italic> to French <italic>TURK</italic> in 1913, <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> took over her share. While the daughter of Edward Sassoon and Mine Rothschild married George Cholmondeley, the Earl of Rocksavage and heir to the Marquess of Cholmondeley, in 1913, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Citi </italic>NB, <italic>Kidder</italic>, and <italic>Baring</italic> financed Austria\u2019s Treasury.\nIn 1913, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, and<italic> Wiener</italic> started a banking consortium to grant a new short-term government loan to Bulgaria and expand the market for the placement of Austro-Hungarian goods. However, they faced competition from Anglo-German <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, which soon sold sovereign debt for Bulgaria and Romania. While <italic>Wiener</italic>, <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, and several Italian banks attempted to establish <italic>Albanian National Bank</italic>, resistance from Western European financial and political centers led to the initiative\u2019s failure. \nIn Serbia, after the <italic>Balkan Wars</italic>, <italic>Franco-Serbian Bank</italic> (\u201cBFS\u201d) acquired branches in Skopje and Bitola from <italic>TURK</italic>. In 1912, BFS collaborated with <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df </italic>to transform <italic>French </italic><italic>Co</italic><italic> for Dredging </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Public Works </italic>into <italic>Franco-Serbian </italic><italic>Co</italic><italic> for Industrial Enterprises </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Public Works</italic>, securing contracts for ten railway routes. In 1913, BFS and <italic>Serbian Trade Bank</italic> of Belgrade founded <italic>Franco-Serbian </italic><italic>Co</italic><italic> for Cement </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Coal Mines</italic>. By early 1914, BFS and the State Class Lottery founded <italic>Franco-Serbian </italic><italic>Co</italic><italic> for the Construction of Hotels in the New Provinces</italic>.\nIn 1913, BFS led the Serbian. Without participation in BFS, German influence in Serbia declined. As German industrialists criticized <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s affiliation with <italic>Andrejevi</italic><italic>\u0107</italic>, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> bought a small bank. German prospects recovered as BFS imposed harsh terms. By 1914, Germany industrialists lowered prices for Serbia and <italic>Disconto</italic> invested in <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>\u2019s bank. Likewise, Italy and Britain made investment plans. But as a Serbian Slavic nationalist killed Austria\u2019s Crown heir, insufficient Serbian response led Austria to invade. As Russia declared war on Austria, Germany and Turkey joined Austria against France, Britain, and Russia.<italic> </italic>\nWith the outbreak of WWI, the international French Court Jew system faced a reckoning. Although naturalized since 1884, awarded the <italic>L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur</italic> in 1908, and the father of a son fighting against the Germans, Emile Oulman was forced to resign from <italic>Comptoir</italic> in 1915. By August 1915, Octave Homberg, a converted director at <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Franco-Serbian Bank</italic>, Ernest Mallet, a Huguenot Regent of BDF, and  <italic>Franco-Suisse Bank</italic>\u2019 Koechlin-in-law Albert Rossier served as delegates alongside British representatives in New York with <italic>Brown</italic> and other banks. \nAs they sought to secure French and British credit balances in America to stabilize exchange rates, NB\u2019s unfamiliarity with foreign acceptances slowed negotiations. A descendant of Thellusson, Fran\u00e7ois Wendel became a Regent of BDF in 1913 and President of <italic>Comit\u00e9 des Forges</italic> iron cartel from 1918. Until then, <italic>Wendel</italic> had been a multinational company since France lost in the <italic>Franco-Prussian War</italic> of 1870, with Wendel cousins serving in the French and German government.\nWhen WWI severed the connection between Austrian banks and Galicia, Austrian rabbis had justified the war as holy war to liberate the Jews of Galicia and revenge for Moldova as Russia ravaged European Jewry. In 1914, Russian forces, under the directive of the Grand Duke Nicholas Romanov, grandson of Tsar Nicholas I Romanov, invaded Galicia. This invasion led to brutal violence against the Jewish population, including property confiscation and movement restrictions. \nThroughout 1915, atrocities escalated, with pillaging, rape, and murder rampant in Jewish communities, forcing around 500,000 Jewish refugees to flee to cities like Vienna and Budapest for safety. Within Russia, the government prohibited the use of German and Yiddish, imposing heavy penalties for its use. They banned performances in Yiddish, closed theatres in Lodz, Wilna, Warsaw, and other Jewish centers, and censored mail for Yiddish. As the Russian army expelled hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Baltic Latvia and Lithuania, the Berlin-Schneurson and other Riga timber and oil magnates tried to relieve the suffering. Since Schaie Berlin\u2019s adoptive grandson Mendel Berlin took over the family business, he relied on plywood exports to Britain.\nWith her industry cartelized by mostly foreigners, Russia nationalized coal industries and PUs during WWI, imposing mandatory fulfillment of state orders and delegalizing alcohol by 1916. As Leonid Krasin joined the <italic>War Industries Committee</italic> to enhance production and materials procurement, he befriended industrial magnate Putilov, who placed him in charge of Moscow\u2019s gunpowder factory. Along with disrupting the manufacture of war materials dependent on alcohol, the vodka ban hindered the traditional urban-rural trade cycle, leading to grain shortages and contributing to urban unrest. \nEconomically, Russia faced a severe crisis during the final years of the Tsarist regime, primarily caused by the strains of WWI, mismanagement, and a failing economy. The war effort drained resources, and the government's inability to manage inflation, supply shortages, and widespread discontent led to a severe budget deficit. As industry coordination broke down and inflation soared, the military and revolutionary forces forced Tsar Nicholas Romanov II to abdicate in the <italic>February Revolution</italic> of 1917. As reformist Prince Georgii Lvov, a descendant of the founder of the Rurik dynasty and in-law of the Romanovs, gained power, his government monopolized the grain trade in response to inflation and instituted free religion.\nOne of the many ways America became involved in the Soviet Union was through marriage. Since by President Wilson appointed William McAdoo UST Secretary in 1913, the widower McAdoo married Wilson\u2019s daughter in 1914. By May 1917, McAdoo\u2019s daughter from his first marriage married the Second Secretary of the Imperial Russian Embassy Ferdinand Mohrenschildt, a third cousin twice removed of the Junker Baltic land-owning noble, Alex Wrangel, whose family had invested in pre-war Caucasus electric operations and kinterlinked with the aristocracy of that region. \nWhile relying on from German funds\u2014moved through Stockholm into Petrograd using <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Siberian Bank of Commerce</italic>\u2014Vladimir Lenin sought refuge in Stasova\u2019s flat and then led Bolsheviks in the <italic>October Revolution</italic> of 1917, Lenin\u2019s government quickly moved to revoke religious protections and nationalize grain warehouses and other industries to centralize economic control. With <italic>rubles</italic> unconvertible into gold since 1914, Lenin nationalized private banks, and then merged them with Russia\u2019s <italic>Imperial State Bank</italic> to establish <italic>Narodny</italic>. As the mercantile and noble elite lost their equity and directorates to Marxist intellectuals and workers, their children were barred from education and career opportunities for decades. Although the Bolsheviks moved to sell the Romanov diamond holdings, <italic>DeBeers</italic>\u2019 <italic>Diamond Syndicate</italic> bought the entire lot to prevent price collapse.\nAmong the nationalized banks were those of the Eliseev family. After Grigori II Eliseev assisted his wife Elena in establishing hospitals and employment agencies for women, he left his fortune to Russian Orthodox churches and other charities in 1914. After Elena passed away in March 1917, Grigori died in August.<italic> </italic>By then, Grigori\u2019s cousin Stepan joined other emigres to Paris, including the Brodsky family whose sugar factories were nationalized. Although remained Artur Levinsohn Rafalovich remained Russia\u2019s French agent until 1917, his son soon died of typhus fever in a Soviet prison. \nWhile President of <italic>Russo-Asiatique</italic>, Saint-Petersburg arms manufacturer Aleksi Putilov united Kamenka and other financiers to organize an armed struggle against the Soviets, Kamenka fled to Finland to support Georgii Lvov\u2019s government in 1917, fellow <italic>Azov-Don Commercial Bank</italic> director Efim Epsteen assumed control in Saint-Petersburg, and was appointed VP of the Central Committee of Saint-Petersburg banks, and negotiated with Bolshevik authorities. His son Michel, moved to Kiew and worked at the Ministry of Finance. Alongside Kamenka on the Council of Representatives of Russian Industry & Trade was <italic>Saint-Petersburg International Commercial Bank</italic>\u2019s Managing Director Efim Shaykevich, who also moved to Finland.\nWhen the Soviet government repudiated Russian debts, the French dominated Russian debts, and were led in Paris by Rafalovich. While the British government partly purchased <italic>Siberian Bank of Commerce</italic> in 1918 through a syndicate including Saint-Petersburg\u2019s <italic>Azov-Don Commercial Bank</italic> Chair Boris Kamenka and Leon Trotsky\u2019s brother-in-law, British bankers that had placed Russian bonds on the London market formed a committee including representatives from <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Lloyd</italic>\u2019s Henry Brand, <italic>Westminster</italic>\u2019s Viscount Goschen, <italic>Hambro</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Kindersley, and others.\nAmong the crisis, Russia\u2019s coal, timber, and cotton strongholds of Ukraine, Latvia, Bukhara, and others seceded and allied with Saint-Petersburg and German capitalist interests in Russian\u2019s<italic> Civil War</italic>, trade and credit collapse inflated commodity prices soared. Amidst the <italic>Revolution</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic> branched to Saint-Petersburg, becoming the first and only American bank in Russia, with staff including Oliver Powell, a Strong descendant and fourth cousin-in-law of the Rockefellers, after he graduated from <italic>Uni of Minnesota</italic> in 1917. \nIn late 1917, the socialist Ukrainian government transformed the Kyiv branch of Russia\u2019s <italic>Imperial State Bank</italic> into <italic>State Bank of Ukraine</italic>, granting it the authority to issue banknotes, under the leadership of Deputy Finance Minister Mykhailo Kryvetskyi. To regulate the activity of around 2,500 <italic>Raiffeisen</italic>-style credit co-operatives, Ukraine also founded <italic>Ukrainbank</italic> under the leadership of Khrystofor Baranovsky, who had previously founded <italic>Kiew</italic><italic> Credit Union </italic>in 1907. \nAfter Russia withdrew from WWI under the <italic>Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</italic> of March 1918, the generals of the German and Austrian armies that occupied Ukraine joined former tsarist officers to back a coup by Ukrainian landowners. As Volodymyr Ihnatovych replaced Kryvetskyi, and was later followed by Kostiantyn Klepachivskyi, all were Christian, along with Baranovsky. Out of Saint-Petersburg, Alex Wrangel\u2019s nephew Pytor Wrangel, parlayed <italic>Rothschild</italic> funds to hire Cossack mercenaries. Amidst the chaos, the revolutionaries executed Tsar Nicholas and his family in July 1918.\nAlex Wrangel\u2019s forces in Siberia were banked by Sergei Dokouchaiev. Born to a Moscow banker from a Samara Old Believer gentry family kinterlinked with the Volga merchants kinterlinked with the Morozov Krestovnikov family. Since 1918 Britain had an ambivalent stance toward the political developments in Central Asia, particularly Turkestan. While officially discouraging the idea of a Muslim-majority separatist state, the British provided financial aid and military supplies to certain local actors and leaders, such as the Emir of Bukhara. \nBack in January 1918, strikes broke out in Vienna\u2019s munitions factories, driven by poor working conditions and socialist agitation. A naval mutiny at Kotor followed in February, reflecting growing discontent within the military. Nationalist movements gained momentum, with the Czechs forming a provisional government in June and South Slavs organizing for independence. Meanwhile, socialist leaders like Karl Renner supported the German alliance, despite rising internal divisions. As Allied offensives intensified and Hungary recalled her troops, Austria\u2019s army collapsed, and the Empire dissolved in late October. On November 11, Habsburg Emperor Karl abdicated, ending WWI, and paving the way for socialist and nationalist-led states.\nAnd as Austria\u2019s Empire dissolved, Europe aided newly independent Poland in seizing west Ukraine, bringing hope to Jews. However, in late 1918, violence erupted in Chrzanow, impoverishing 70% of the Jews. After the assimilated Hungarian Jew B\u00e9la \u201cKun\u201d Kohn established the Hungarian Soviet Republic, his overthrow in August 1919 spurred pogroms for months in 50 towns and the deaths of numerous Jews. While some Jews converted, the ruling class refrained from condemning the pogroms.\nThis violence, targeting leftists and Jews, was part of a broader wave of anti-Jewish disturbances in neighboring regions like the Russian Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, and Czechoslovakia. Likewise, Polish army recruits attacked Jews in Lublin. Following the pogrom in Kiew, Michel Epsteen fled to Paris. He was joined by his father, who, after repeated arrests, left Saint-Petersburg. Likewise, Efim Shaykevich relocated from Finland to Paris, where he grew <italic>Petersburg International Commercial Bank</italic>\u2019s former Paris branch.\nThrough 1919, Jews in Pinsk and elsewhere in the <italic>Pale</italic> faced dire circumstances under German occupation, enduring food shortages and epidemics. After the evacuation of Soviet troops in October 1920, Wrangel-allied Polish General Stanislaw Bulak-Balachowicz\u2019s Cossack bands raped and murdered hundreds in Pinsk. Enroute to Ukraine in 1921, Bulak-Balachowicz similarly pillaged Minsk. \nWhen WWI began, Rosa Luxemburg remained an anti-war activist and helped organize the Zimmerwald Conference. She was arrested in March 1915 and imprisoned until February 1916, during which time she continued writing. After a brief release, Luxemburg was re-arrested in July 1916 and held in Berlin, Wronka, and Breslau until the end of the war. On November 9, 1918, as Kaiser Wilhelm II fled to Holland and the German Revolution intensified, workers in Breslau freed Luxemburg from prison. Her continued Marxist activism led to her arrest and execution by German officers in early 1919, in Berlin, with her corpse thrown into a canal. \nWrangel\u2019s kinterlink with America broke as William McAdoo resigned from UST and his son-in-law Ferdinand Mohrenschildt died in 1919. After taking part in the Brest-Litovsk negotiations ending Russia\u2019s participation in WWI, Krasin led as <italic>Commissar for Trade & Industry</italic>, and supplied the Marxist forces against Wrangel. From 1920 Leonid Krasin helped negotiated with Britain as the Soviet Union\u2019s Ambassador and subsequently with France. Among the contenders for the Russian throne was the deposed Tsar Nicholas Romanov\u2019s cousin, Grand Duke Cyril Romanov, grandson of Tsar Alex II, and his PM, Vladimir Biskupskii, a Ukrainian prince who made a fortune on Siberian oil. With funding from anti-Marxists in France, Hungary, and Germany seeking to restore monarchy in Germany and Russia, Biskupskii funded the rise of Nazism.\nBiskupskii\u2019s American agent for funding his campaign and Nazism, was Boris Brasol, of an ennobled Ukrainian Cossack military family. Working for the Russian Ministry of Justice and serving as a lieutenant in the Russian Imperial Guard during WWI, Brasol volunteered for America\u2019s <italic>War Trade Board</italic>\u2019s intelligence bureau, where he supplied intelligence focusing on what he considered the subversive element of Jews. \nWith a fixation on <italic>Kuhn</italic>, he played a pivotal role in disseminating antisemitic conspiracy theories. Brasol\u2019s involvement in antisemitic activities extended to his role as a contributor to Henry Ford\u2019s <italic>Dearborn Independent</italic>, where he provided false history to support Ford\u2019s antisemitism. Since <italic>Rothschild</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic> financed <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic> and helped precipitate the <italic>Russian Revolution of 1905</italic>, antisemitic conspiracists linked Bolshevism to the bankers, who they claimed sought to expand Jewish power.\nGrand Duke Cyril\u2019s Paris banker was his cousin Grand Duke Dmitri Romanov. The same year that Dmitri married Audrey Emery of Cincinnati in 1926, her brother wed a Langhorne niece-in-law of Viscount Astor and <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Baron Henry Brand. Among the many aristocrat \u00e9migr\u00e9s to America was Prince Serge Obolensky, whose cousin once removed\u2019s mother-in-law was Baron Alex Stiglitz\u2019s adopted daughter. A former officer in the Imperial Russian Army, Obolensky briefly married an Astor and became a hotel baron in New York. \nAnd Alex Nelidow\u2014a son of the late Russian ambassador and Princess Olga Hilkow, a descendant of the founder of the Rurik dynasty\u2014joined <italic>Hallgarten</italic> and married, in 1925, a daughter of Gordon Auchincloss\u2019 British cousin and George King of New York and Newport, Rhode Island, whose ancestors included Scottish Baronet James Coats, Peter Stuyvesant, and John Winthrop. In 1926, a niece of John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife married Georgian Prince Simon Sidamon, whose family had known that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.\nAnother was Valerian Lada-Mocarski, the son of a general in Russian Turkestan, who was one of the few members of the Tsar\u2019s guard to survive Russia\u2019s 1917 Revolution. After arriving in Paris in 1919, he worked as a secretary for his uncle, the Ukrainian ambassador, before beginning his banking career at <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> in Vienna. Meeting an heiress of <italic>Klots Throwing Co</italic> of Pennsylvania, they wed in 1924 and moved to New York. Through an introduction from his wife\u2019s uncle, he joined the new <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York, becoming head of banking in 1930. Likewise, Old Believer Sergei Dokouchaiev fled to America in 1921, and soon joined <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, for whom he helped establish European branches.\nAgainst secession in 1920, the Soviets ousted the Emir of Bukhara to incorporate the long semi-independent cotton stronghold and systemically eliminated Cossacks with <italic>de-Cossackization</italic>.  <italic>Narodny</italic> inflated the <italic>ruble</italic> until Lenin won the war in 1921. So, he abolished <italic>Narodny</italic> as a central bank and established <italic>Bank of the Soviet Union</italic> (\u201cBSU\u201d). Following the Bolshevik occupation of Kyiv and the fall of the autonomous Ukraine, much of the leaders of the latter emigrated to France. While BSU<italic> </italic>absorbed <italic>State Bank of Ukraine</italic>, <italic>Ukrainbank</italic> continued to oversee credit unions through the 1920s under Soviet control. \nCarl F\u00fcrstenberg became the Soviet Union\u2019s Minister of Finance since yielding <italic>Berliner</italic> to his son Hans Natanson F\u00fcrstenberg in 1919. (Hans had trained at <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic> London before WWI, but later had a falling out with his father over succession at <italic>Berliner</italic>.) The Soviet Union\u2019s top banker was Aron Scheinman. Born to a merchant banker and a Katz descendant of Wilna Gaon in Suwalki, Poland, Scheinman helped found the Socialist Bund in Suwalki and participated in the <italic>Russian Revolution of 1905</italic>. \nAfter chairing the Helsinki Soviet Executive Committee and served as a Deputy in the Russian Constituent Assembly, he became the finance commissar of the Northern Region and Deputy Finance Commissar of Russia in 1918, then served as a financial attach\u00e9 in Scandinavia. Scheinman joined the Foreign Trade Commissariat in 1919 and chaired BSU <italic>Russia</italic> from 1921, then led BSU from 1923.\nAmong the nations to gain independence from Russia after 1920, were Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. After the war, Lenin allowed free trade with America and privatized grain with progressive in-kind taxes. Among the American traders was Armand Hammer. While his Marxist father left Tsarist Russia in the 1880\u2019s, Armand Hammer traded wheat with Lenin for treasures, mansions, and mines.  \nAs <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Commerciale, Industrielle & Financi\u00e8re pour la Russie</italic> started in 1920, with founder-directors including <italic>Russo-Asiatique</italic> (Putilov and Rafalovich), <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> (Andr\u00e9 Homberg), <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> (Jacques Gunzburg), <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Creusot</italic>\u2019s<italic> Schneider</italic>, <italic>Transatlantique</italic>, and <italic>Industrial Bank of China</italic>, <italic>Schneider</italic> acquired Russia-focused <italic>Bank of Northern Countries </italic>of Paris. Likewise, <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Parisienne </italic>financed the Soviet-controlled <italic>Commercial Bank of Moscow</italic>, the first nominally private bank organized under the Soviet government, to attempt to take over <italic>Banque Russo-Asiatique</italic>.\nGaining support from <italic>Nationalbank</italic> and BSU, Olaf Aschberg, a Marxist Jewish heir from Sweden, led the effort. After his bank was blacklisted due to financing the Soviet regime, Aschberg reorganized the bank into <italic>Svensk Ekonomiebolaget</italic>. The bank\u2019s London agent was <italic>British Bank of North Commerce</italic>, chaired by Earl Grey. \nAschberg\u2019s circle of business associates included Krassin, Minister of Finance Carl F\u00fcrstenberg, and Max May. May was designated director of <italic>Commercial Bank of Moscow </italic>in 1922 with the former heads of <italic>Moscow </italic><italic>Merchant Bank</italic>, <italic>Junker</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>, and <italic>Siberian Bank of Commerce</italic>, which had been partly purchased by the British government in 1918. After May, one of <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>\u2019s few Jewish executives, resigned due to anti-German sentiment in 1918, he joined America\u2019s first discount company <italic>Foreign Trade Banking Corp</italic> until she dissolved in 1921. With Frankfurt connections and Fuld, Lazard, and Ladenburg cousins, Max May of Darmstadt trained at <italic>May</italic> Mannheim before immigrating to America and becoming a citizen by 1888. He worked at the <italic>Union</italic> and <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>Chicago</italic> until 1904. Joining <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> of New York that year, he rose to VP leading her FX Department. \nSince Aschberg traveled to Paris in 1921 to sell Soviet gold, the Soviets acquired <italic>Comptoir Parisien de Banque et de Change</italic> in Paris, which became <italic>Narodny</italic><italic> </italic>Paris. <italic>Narodny</italic><italic> </italic>Paris was controlled by a network including the Imbert family, who later maintained influence in French financial and military circles. That year, the Soviets also purchased a Berlin bank, <italic>Narodny</italic><italic> </italic>Berlin, operated via communist administrators and nominal shareholders. <italic>Narodny</italic> Tehran formed shortly after.\nAfter <italic>All-Russian Co-operative Society</italic> (\u201c<italic>Arcos</italic>\u201d) became the first Soviet overseas import-export organization in London in 1920, <italic>American Trading Corp</italic> (\u201c<italic>Amtorg</italic>\u201d) started three years later. While Hammer\u2019s venture fused into <italic>Amtorg</italic>, Averell Harriman became <italic>Amtorg</italic>\u2019s forwarding agent. The following year, Harriman took control of Georgian manganese mining mines, soon delivering to <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic>. Among the first to obtain approval for a fur trade agreement from <italic>Arcos</italic> and become one of the largest Soviet traders, the Eitingon family traded Russian furs since the 19th century out of Leipzig. In 1921, the Eitingon family founded <italic>Lo</italic><italic>dzki Bank</italic> in Lodz. Growing in New York and acquiring furriers in Saint-Louis, <italic>Eitingon</italic> issued stock through <italic>Goldman</italic> by 1928. \nGuided by and giving reign to Krasin, Lenin prioritized GE-built rural electricity. As BSU replaced the <italic>ruble</italic> with the gold <italic>chervonets</italic>, runs from <italic>rubles</italic> deflated urban goods relative to tax-payable grain until the <italic>chervonets</italic> spread to the countryside. The volatility eased as BSU fused <italic>chervonets</italic> into <italic>rubles</italic>. After Lenin died in 1923, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Otto Kahn, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Thomas Lamont, and Averell Harriman negotiated with BSU by March. \nLikewise, Aschberg sold <italic>Russian Commercial Bank</italic> to the Soviet government. While Max May retired, <italic>Russian Commercial Bank</italic> subsequently doubled her share capital, with holdings by BSU, and absorbed <italic>Russo-Asiatique</italic> as <italic>Narodny</italic><italic> </italic>Paris became a hub for Soviet-linked financial operations. That year, Sonia Ashkenasy Gunzburg pushed her daughter Anna to marry David Weill\u2019s son, Jean-Alexandre. However, they divorced after five months in 1924, as Anna claimed violence, leading her mother to commit suicide. \nEarlier that year, Lenin\u2019s death brought about the end of protections to his entourage. Shortly after becoming Soviet Union\u2019s Ambassador for Britain, Krasin died in 1925 and Stalin abandoned Lenin\u2019s rural electrification for armament. As Joseph Stalin centralized power, he changed economic direction. Blaming private credit, he monopolized banks into BSU. As he expropriated foreign bank assets in 1924 and purged opposition. \nAnd since <italic>Schneider</italic> acquired <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Northern Countries</italic>, the bank hired a son of former <italic>Azov-Don Commercial Bank</italic> director Efim Epsteen, Michel, in 1925. Another son joined <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. Scheinman served on and off as Internal Trade Commissar, deputy commissar of Foreign and Internal Trade, and head of BSU and Finance Commissariat, until he was sent to New York as Chair of <italic>Amtorg</italic>\u2019s board in 1929.\nSince China\u2019s <italic>Revolution of 1911</italic>, Mongolia asserted its independence under Khan rule. By 1921, Mongolian revolutionaries and Soviet supporters overthrew Chinese occupation forces. However, the Khan\u2019s death in 1924 increased tensions between the reformist government and the Church and nobility. After BSU founded <italic>Bank of Mongolia</italic> in 1924, Mongolia transitioned into a Westernized republic Soviet satellite by 1928.\nAsian banking also transformed. Before WWI, Jewish <italic>Sassoon</italic> was a leader British trade with India and China. However, the nature of the firm broke apart. As <italic>Sassoon</italic> employee Silas Hardoon resigned and built a real estate fortune with his Chinese wife, Sassoon cousins Ely Kadoorie and Ellis Hayim left to form <italic>Kadoorie</italic> and <italic>Potts</italic>. Christians stepped in. \nSince British-born Frederick Davey entered the Royal Indian Marine and the Royal Navy during WWI, he served as the Divisional Naval Transport Officer at Bombay from 1918 until retiring as a Commander in 1920, becoming a director at <italic>Sassoon</italic>, where he led the Calcutta office. Similarly, Joseph Swan joined <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> of New York after serving in WWI. Moving to China, he worked at <italic>Asia Banking Corp</italic> and <italic>American Oriental Banking Corp</italic> until 1926. After several months with <italic>Potts</italic>, Swan bought a seat on <italic>Shanghai Stock Exchange</italic> and established <italic>Swan</italic> in 1926. With correspondents in New York, London, San Francisco, Paris, and Berlin, <italic>Swan</italic> became the main dealer in international and local securities.\nWhile <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and other major banks refused to provide a bailout for the note-issuing <italic>Industrial Bank of China</italic> in the <italic>Panic of 1921</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic> reorganized <italic>Industrial Bank of China</italic> into <italic>Chinoise</italic> without note issuance privileges. Among <italic>Chinoise</italic>\u2019s early hires was Wladimir Archawski. Born in Geneva, Switzerland, to wealthy Jewish parents from Ukraine, Archawski worked at <italic>Morgan</italic>-affiliated <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> in New York and Paris from 1920 until he became General Inspector at <italic>Chinoise </italic>in 1925. He was appointed Deputy General Director in 1926 and delegated Administrator of <italic>Transatlantic Bank</italic>.\nMeanwhile, native Chinese bankers bloomed and reorganized after the <italic>Panic of 1921</italic>. Since Emperor Yuan\u2019s regime weakened in 1916 and he abandoned the imperial title, <italic>Bank of Communications</italic>, which had lent heavily to his government, faced loan defaults and cash shortages, and runs began in April. While that bank stopped redeeming notes in May, <italic>Bank of China</italic> Shanghai continued redemption. In 1916, the latter declared independence from the Yuan government, shortly before his death. In 1917, <italic>Bank of China</italic> shifted to shareholder control.\nAfter the <italic>Panic of </italic><italic>1921</italic>, <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> shifted to Jiangnan and Shanghai banking leaders in 1922 and ended lending to military forces. Likewise, in 1923, the Peking government sold nearly all of her <italic>Bank of China</italic> shares. During these changes, Baimei Bian left <italic>Zhongfu Bank</italic> to manage <italic>Bank of China</italic> Tianjin as Kemin Wang, who headed <italic>Industrial Bank of China</italic>, became Head of <italic>Bank of China</italic> and Minister of Finance. \nWith the death of Yuan, his cousin\u2019s <italic>Yien Yieh Commercial Bank</italic> failed to receive government funds, and became a private institution supported by warlords and merchants. Chekiang-born Dingchang Wu, former Governor of <italic>Bank of China</italic> and Ministry of Finance Vice Chair, became President after 1917, and organized the first Chinese banking syndicate by uniting <italic>Yien Yieh</italic>, <italic>Kincheng</italic>, <italic>China & South Sea</italic>, and <italic>Continental </italic>banks in 1922.\nMing Li, born to Shaoxing silver merchants, studied under missionaries and then in Japan. After returning to China, he became an auditor of <italic>Chekiang Provincial & Industrial Bank</italic>, which founded <italic>Hangchow Electric </italic>to industrialize Hangchow. As Li grew the Shanghai branch, he co-founded <italic>Chinese Bankers Association</italic> in 1917, and joined <italic>Bank of China</italic>\u2019s board in 1920. By 1922, <italic>Chekiang Provincial </italic>broke away from the parent bank and reorganized the Shanghai branch as <italic>Chekiang Industrial Bank.</italic> Likewise, the Chinese diaspora across Southeast Asia made their fortunes in the rice, rubber, shipping, and import-export industries, they diversified into trade banking, the largest being <italic>Oversea Chinese Banking Corp </italic>(\u201cOCBC\u201d).\nBy then, a Christian convert, Charles Soong, was born in China but spent eight years in America. Returning to China, he married Kwei-tseng from an early Christian Chinese family. They had three daughters and a son, TV. By 1913, their first daughter, Ai-ling, became secretary for the married Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of modern China. After the second daughter, Ching-ling, married Sun in 1914, Ai-ling married <italic>Asiatic Petroleum</italic>\u2019s Kung in 1915. Kwei-tseng took over the family after Charles died in 1918. Sun hired brother-in-law TV to administer salt mines in 1923. Before Sun died in 1925, he introduced Soong\u2019s third daughter, Mei-ling, to General Chiang Kai-shek.\nSince their creation under the Imperial government, <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> and <italic>Bank of China</italic> distributed branches differently. While the former divided in subsystems along transportation routes, the latter organized by province, with each branch supervising subbranches in the same province. So, while neither focused on core central, the decentralized structure of the latter mirrored warlord divisions. \nMoreover, <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> faced problems due to government overdrafts since 1908. Only in 1924 did normal business functions and profits resume. By 1925, the bank\u2019s executives fled China due to political turmoil. Meanwhile, <italic>Bank of China</italic> funds helped Chiang defeat Beijing in 1926. As Ching-ling and TV participated in the joint <italic>Kuomintang</italic>-Marxist forum that year, Chiang proposed to Mei-ling. Ai-ling supported the union despite Chiang being a married non-Christian. However, Ching-ling opposed it and left for Moscow, believing the new policies perverted Sun\u2019s principles. \nAfter Kwei-tseng approved the marriage in 1927, Chiang took lead of <italic>Kuomintang</italic> in 1928. Without Marxists, his nine-member cabinet had seven Christians, including Kung and TV. Finance Minister TV soon became Governor of the new <italic>Central Bank of China</italic>. As Ming Li served as <italic>Central Bank of China</italic>\u2019s supervisory board chair, he became chair of both <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> and <italic>Bank of China</italic>. <italic>Bank of China</italic>\u2019s manager had stepped down in protest as Chiang sought more funds. By year-end, <italic>Bank of China</italic> reorganized into a FX bank. And with the capital moving north to Nanjing, both banks changed headquartered to Shanghai. \nFollowing financial difficulties, Li and the rest of Shanghai Municipal Council decided to sell China\u2019s largest PU in an open bidding process. SGE and HSBC won the bid and established the <italic>Shanghai Power </italic>in 1928. Li later joined <italic>Shanghai\u2019s</italic> advisory board to contribute to the expansion of electricity production in the city. While <italic>Sassoon</italic> diversified from trade to industrialize Hong Kong, Shanghai, and other cities with world-class skyscrapers and hotels, their cousins <italic>Kadoorie</italic> spread electricity as they gained control of <italic>China Light </italic>in 1928. \nWhile trying to capture Azeri fields from Russia, Germany depended on Austrian Galician oil as Romanian fields were destroyed. Like, Czech forces cut off Bohemian coal to Austria in 1918, the <italic>Treaty of Versailles</italic> seized assets after WWI. Germany and Austria lost their coal and oil colonies to Czechoslovakia, France, Poland, and Romania. Among Germany most important losses were the industrial coal and steel lands of the Rhine.\nOut of Cologne, Kurt Schr\u00f6der promoted the separation of German industrial in 1919 to France to safeguard industry. Instead of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, he had joined <italic>Styn</italic>, which banked the industrial Rhine and Ruhr. By 1869, <italic>Styn</italic> kinterlinked with a daughter of Christian industrialist and <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> co-founder Gustav Mevissen. Mevissen\u2019s brother-in-law Franz Koenigs had invested in coal, and after his son wed an extended Krupp cousin, Johann Bunge\u2019s grandson, in 1872, <italic>Krupp</italic> acquired some of the Mevissen and Koenigs coal fields after the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>. \nIn the 1890s, two great nieces of Gustav Mevissen\u2019s wife married two Schr\u00f6der cousins. By 1907, Johann Schr\u00f6der, a nephew of the Schr\u00f6der cousins, wed Julinka Styn, whose father was a cousin of Mevissen\u2019s son-in-law. In 1908, the Styn family was ennobled, and by 1914, Johann\u2019s second cousin, Kurt, wed Julinka\u2019s ennobled Schnitzler cousin, of the Styn-in-law Carl Schnitzler who transformed Styn into a bank in the first half of the 19th century. However, <italic>League of Nations</italic> agreed to govern the Saar Territory for fifteen years and then a vote by the inhabitants. \nDescended from Rhineland textile magnates, Robert Croon Pferdmenges began his banking career at textile bank <italic>Bergisch-M\u00e4rkische </italic>(acquired by <italic>Deutsche</italic> in 1914), later joining <italic>Disconto</italic> in 1902. In 1905, he was transferred to London and then to Antwerp in 1914 to establish a new branch. During WWI, he returned to Antwerp as part of the German civil administration and managed <italic>Disconto</italic> Antwerp until 1916, when <italic>Disconto</italic> acquired Cologne bank  <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, which Pferdmenges then headed. After WWI, he was elected Chair of <italic>Association of Banks & Bankers in the Rhineland & Westphalia</italic> in 1921. \nAs Britain seized London branches of German banks, Anglo-German <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Kleinwort</italic> became the main conduits for German clients as trade resumed in 1920. Along with reimbursing credits for <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, and <italic>Disconto</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> London became<italic> Deutsche</italic>\u2019s British correspondent. Bruno Schr\u00f6der also advised FRS <italic>New York</italic> on developing acceptances. Since Thomas Merton\u2014a brother in-law of Katz descendant Cohen-Barent and <italic>Wagg</italic><italic> </italic>families and cousin of the Rothschilds\u2014married Violet Sawyer in 1913, Violet\u2019s cousin, Francis Bridgeman\u2014a cousin of the Lascelles, Baring, Grenfell, and Smyth families\u2014married a granddaughter of Alex Kleinwort in 1922. \nSince<italic> Ladenburg</italic> Mannheim merged with <italic>Disconto</italic> in 1905, <italic>Rheinische Credit</italic> co-founder Ladenburg kinterlinked with<italic> W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank </italic>in 1911, and <italic>Rheinische </italic>took over <italic>Ladenburg</italic>\u2019s cousin bank <italic>Hohenemser</italic> in 1919. While <italic>Rheinische</italic>\u2019s clients included automobile manufacturer <italic>Benz</italic>, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> bought <italic>Daimler</italic> shares in 1909, but declined a seat on <italic>Daimler\u2019</italic>s board, instead allowing <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic> to represent her interests. In 1917, <italic>Deutsche</italic> had an opportunity to join <italic>Daimler</italic>\u2019s board, but rejected it due to a scandal involving <italic>Daimler</italic>\u2019s war profits. Not until 1920 did <italic>Deutsche</italic> send a representative to <italic>Daimler</italic>\u2019s Board. \nBack in 1916, Romania joined the Allies but was defeated, leading to peace talks in Bucharest in 1918. <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>\u2019s Felix Margulies Somary\u2014the son of a converted Galician lawyer of Vienna\u2014represented <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna and extended her Romanian timber leases. After returning to Vienna, he found <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s assets frozen, with all of her German assets appearing to be lost, her French, British, and American assets sequestered, and her position threatened by nationalization plans across the former empire. In early 1919, as revolutions spread in Budapest, Munich, and Vienna, he arranged to transfer <italic>Witkowitz</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s other assets to a Swiss bank he acquired, <italic>Blankart</italic>. He traveled through Czechoslovakia to Berlin, obtained approval from GRB, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Disconto</italic>, and carried sealed securities through Germany.\nAfter 1918, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s<italic> Creditanstalt</italic> and <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic>\u2014transformed into an international consortium involving <italic>Morgan </italic>in New York, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> in London, <italic>Amsterdam</italic><italic> Bank</italic><italic> </italic>in Amsterdam, <italic>Solvay</italic> in Brussels, and UBS in Geneva\u2014controlled <italic>Daimler</italic> Austria. By 1920, <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Morgan </italic>invested in <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>. Paul Warburg\u2019s brother Max of Hamburg raised capital for GGE, 1921, Paul started <italic>International Acceptance</italic> IHC in New York to rebuild Europe with initial investment from <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg, <italic>Svenska Handelsbanken</italic>, <italic>Skandinaviska Kredit</italic>, Ernest Cassel, <italic>National Provincial</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>, <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>, <italic>Dreyfu\u00df </italic>Basel, <italic>Hope</italic>, <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>, <italic>Dillon</italic>, and <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>Boston</italic>, where Paul\u2019s son James worked until joining his father.\nFollowing the <italic>Treaty of Versailles</italic>, British authorities liquidated German bank branches in London, and a five-year ban on new German bank branches abroad took effect. But Berlin no longer had to rely on London for capital with the rise of Amsterdam and New York. By 1920, <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg negotiated with <italic>Nederlandsche Bank</italic> over <italic>mark</italic> bills of exchange that had lost value during inflation. \n<italic>Warburg</italic> proposed converting the bills into real estate or silver, but <italic>Nederlandsche</italic> rejected the plan once FX. In 1922, <italic>Nederlandsche </italic>began supporting German trade finance, allowing acceptance companies and other operations to expand in Amsterdam. As <italic>International Acceptance </italic>raised investment, <italic>Warburg</italic> established <italic>Warburg</italic> Amsterdam and <italic>Nederlandsche Crediet en Financiering</italic>, an international investment trust modeled on <italic>International Acceptance</italic>, to attract capital for German industry.\nBy then, Christians mostly forced out Jewish bankers as <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>, <italic>Amsterdamsche</italic>, <italic>Rotterdamsche</italic>, <italic>Twentsche</italic>, and <italic>Incassobank</italic> dominated the money market. <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic> merged with <italic>Amsterdamse Crediet</italic> of 1853 in 1918. Only <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>  maintained her position in international loans alongside the Christian <italic>Hope</italic>.\nAt the start of WWI, <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic> heir Edgar Fuld married Marie Mendelssohn Warschauer, kinterlinking with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> in Berlin. Fuld became a partner of <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic> along with brothers Katz descendant Paul and Robert Cahn Daniels May. Related through the former Chief Rabbi of Bonn, the Mays transferred Austrian banker Alfons Thorsch\u2019s ownership of Czech oil refinery to Amsterdam. With the failure of Goldschmidt cousins <italic>Marx</italic> in 1922, Paul May\u2019s daughter married a <italic>Marx</italic><italic> </italic>heir, allowing Robert May to direct French oil refiner Goldet-Meurthe\u2019s <italic>Western Bank</italic> in Amsterdam.\nDespite the kinterlink with <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>,<italic>Mendelssohn</italic> formed semi-independent <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam. Since Stuttgart-born Fritz Mannheimer\u2014whose Frankel uncles sold luxury horses to German royals\u2014earned a law degree before buying raw materials for the war effort in Berlin during WWI. By 1916, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> and GRB sent him to Amsterdam to engage in international finance in 1916. Having formed a good relationship with <italic>Dutch East Indies Co </italic>successor <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>, Mannheimer co-founding <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam after WWI to float a Dutch loan to finance German reparations in 1920 with <italic>Mees</italic> and <italic>Pierson</italic>. \n<italic>Mendelssohn</italic> funded <italic>Krupp</italic> with Dutch capital, despite competing attempts by Stinnes and Rathenau rivaled to fuse her into a dominant enterprise. The German private banks rejuvenated themselves and consolidated partnerships. Since Paul Kempner, the Austrian nephew of Bonn electro-industrial investment bank <italic>Levy</italic>\u2019s Louis Hagen, married the daughter of <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>\u2019s Managing Partner Franz Mendelssohn, a Katz descendant of Moses Mendelssohn and Samuel Oppenheim in 1918, Kempner joined <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, and Rudolf L\u00f6b\u2014Kempner\u2019s second cousin, Alex Coppel\u2019s great grandson, and Louis Hagen\u2019s first cousin once removed\u2014became a partner since working at <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> from 1896. By 1922, Kempner became a <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> partner and<italic> Levy</italic> formed a profit-sharing arrangement with <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne. \nWhile Franz Mendelssohn became President of the <italic>German Industry & Commerce Day</italic>, Kempner soon served as Austrian Consul and a German Democratic Party board member, and Germany\u2019s representative for financial matters at <italic>League of Nations</italic>. But although Germany dismantled discriminatory policies that excluded Jews from the judiciary and state prosecutor roles, only two Jews represented in GRS after 1919. Having left GGE, Rathenau negotiated reparations with France and Britain as Foreign Minister from 1920. After Austrian Rudolf Hilferding gained citizenship in 1920, the Marxist medical doctor served as Germany\u2019s Finance Minister in 1923. \n<italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic><italic> </italic>had also kinterlinked with <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> cousin and partner Julius Schwabach, whose son Paul married a <italic>Schr\u00f6der </italic>cousin of Hamburg by 1898<italic>.</italic> While Paul became a <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> partner, his daughter married Eduard Heydt\u2014a descendant of a <italic>Deutsche</italic> co-founder and cousin of the Engels, Styn, and Kamp families\u2014in 1918. As Britain seized Heydt\u2019s London bank during WWI, he established an Amsterdam bank with <italic>Stinnes</italic> and acquired a stake in <italic>Nordstern Bank</italic> in Berlin in 1920. Since the <italic>Reichstag</italic> (\u201cGRS\u201d) allowed electric cartels, Stinnes linked Ruhr coal to Alpine hydroelectricity with RWE and bought <italic>Siemens</italic>.\nAlthough Christians of the Cologne cousinhood also entered Amsterdam, including, <italic>Rhodius</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Koenigs</italic>, led by cousins of the Styns and affiliated with <italic>Deutsche</italic> co-founder  <italic>Delbr\u00fcck Schickler</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> connected with Jews in Berlin. When Heinrich Oberndoerffer Aufh\u00e4user\u2014a grandson of Munich private banker <italic>Oberndoerffer</italic>, nephew of <italic>Bayerische Vereinsbank</italic> co-founder <italic>Wilmersodoerffer</italic>, and cousin-in-law of descendants of Katz, Samson Wertheim, and Samuel Oppenheim\u2014died in 1917, his son Martin partnered <italic>Aufh\u00e4user</italic> with <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> to resolve a capital dispute, retaining control of the bank while expanding her securities business. \nA competitor of <italic>Stinnes</italic>, German industrialist and banker Fritz Thyssen founded <italic>Bank voor Handel</italic> in Rotterdam in 1918, with funds from <italic>Bank voor Handel</italic>, Thyssen established <italic>Union Banking Corp</italic> in New York by 1924. The following year, Averell Harriman met Thyssen in Europe and agreed to join <italic>Union Banking</italic>\u2019s board. Additionally, several partners from <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic> joined the board to manage Thyssen\u2019s American interests.\nWhile <italic>Deutsche</italic> opened a branch in Amsterdam<italic> </italic>and <italic>Kaufmann</italic> was the agent of <italic>Commerzbank, Proehl</italic> <italic>Guttman</italic> represented <italic>Dresdner</italic>.<italic> </italic>Since <italic>Dresdner</italic> Chair Eugen Guttman\u2019s son Fritz Magnus Guttman served as assistant director of <italic>Dresdner</italic> London before WWI, he fled to Amsterdam, where he partnered with Ernst Proehl\u2014a Hamburg-born banker who married a Bondi cousin\u2014to form <italic>Proehl Guttman</italic>, focusing on bank acceptances, credit, and stock issues.\nAs Albert Goldschmidt Rothschild divorced his Rothschild cousin and married Marion Guttmann Schuster\u2014whose grandfathers were <italic>Dresdner</italic>\u2019s Eugen Guttmann and <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Johann Schuster\u2014in 1922, <italic>Goldschmidt Rothschild</italic> of Frankfurt acquired <italic>Falkenburger</italic>, which became her Berlin branch under the leadership of Ernst Wallach. Descended from a Stern cousin of the Rothschilds, Ernst\u2019s brother Fritz had married Eugen Guttmann\u2019s niece before WWI and led Berlin beer and banking firm <italic>Boehm Reitzenbaum</italic>\u2014associated with their cousin and brother-in-law\u2014while Ernst sat on the board of <italic>Dresdner</italic> and several industrial companies. Several years later, Fritz\u2019s daughter had married a Katz descendant of Simon Bondi.\nSince branching into Berlin and kinterlinking with extended Warburg cousins at <italic>Bondi</italic> and other Saxon bankers to connect with industry before WWI, <italic>Arnhold</italic> established <italic>Bank for the Ceramics Industry</italic> in Berlin by 1919. This, along with her brewing industry investments, placed <italic>Arnhold</italic> at the center of German industrial financing. In the 1920s, <italic>Arnhold </italic>expanded internationally with branches in Amsterdam, New York, Vienna, and Zurich, facilitating foreign credit arrangements for German industries.\nLikewise, Jacob Schiff\u2019s in-laws at <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt serviced German cities and mechanical engineering, construction industry, and electrical economy sectors. After the war, <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt opened a second branch in Berlin after the war in 1919, deepened ties with her Basel parent, acquired <italic>Landsberg</italic>, and invested in <italic>Reitler</italic> in Vienna in 1921 and founding <italic>Strupp</italic>\u2014led by Julius Strupp, whose Wertheim mother was related to the Frankfurt sewing industrialist with an unknown connection to Samson Wertheim\u2014in New York in 1922. \n<italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt later received investment from Theodor Vogelstein of Paris. Among the new partners who joined during this time were Kurt Landsberg, whose wife descended from Samson Wertheim, Paul Wallich, and former <italic>Deutsche </italic>director Werner Mankiewitz, son of <italic>Detusche</italic> board member Paul Mankiewitz. \nWallich, a son of a converted <italic>Deutsche</italic> partner and grandnephew of Count Joseph Cah\u00e9n, resigned as co-owner of <italic>Berliner</italic> due to disagreements with Carl F\u00fcrstenberg. Following the retirement of Beit and Speyer-in-law Arthur Gwinner in 1919, Paul Mankiewitz\u2014a descendant of the aunts of Katz and Samuel Oppenheim\u2014became <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Management Board\u2019s first practicing Jewish speaker. As he retired in 1923, Elkan Heinemann departed due to antisemitism. \nStill, some Christian bankers had elite Jewish connections. The regional director of <italic>Deutsche </italic>in Magdeburg from 1922 was Christian estate holder Georg Bennecke, a great-nephew of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s great-granddaughter and a cousin once removed by marriage to Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s granddaughter. That said, of the 7,500 bankers and brokers active in Germany in 1925, only 3.3% were Jewish. \nBefore the war, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> was the only large German bank with a presence in Amsterdam via <italic>Amstrdamsche</italic>. Still, she joined <italic>Hamburgers</italic><italic> Bankierskantoor</italic> and <italic>Hollandsche Kreditbank</italic><italic> </italic>by 1923. While his family already had linked <italic>Nationalbank</italic>, <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, and <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic><italic> </italic>before WWI, Walter Sobernheim Lando married Gerson Bleichr\u00f6der\u2019s grandnephew in 1919.<italic> Nationalbank</italic> and <italic>Commerzbank</italic> also merged brewers. <italic>Schultheiss</italic> fused with <italic>Patzenhofer</italic> in 1920, growing into Berlin\u2019s largest brewery under Walter. \nThe following year, <italic>Bank of Saxe-Meiningen</italic> director Katz-descendant Albert Katz merged his cousin Ludwig Katz\u2019s <italic>Breslauer Spritfabrik </italic>with <italic>Osteibische Spritwerke</italic> into <italic>Ostwerke </italic>and entered into an interest group agreement with <italic>Schultheiss-Patzenhofer</italic>. Not having invested internationally before WWI, and so not being disposed of many assets, <italic>Commerzbank</italic> merged with <italic>Mittledeutsche Privatbank</italic> of Magdeburg in 1920, and later acquired <italic>Vereinsbank Wismar</italic>. From 8 branches in 1913, <italic>Commerzbank</italic> expanded to 246 by 1924.\nThough his father was a modest merchant from Hannover, unrelated to the Frankfurt Goldschmidt family, Jakob Goldsmith\u2019s mother was related to the Sonneborn family, with interests in oil refining and textiles from Hamburg to Baltimore, with cousin in-laws including the Guggenheim, Lehman, Salomon, and Mack families. While Jakob pursued banking, his brother manufactured self-printing index cards and married a descendant of Samson Wertheim. \nStarting as a clerk at <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Hannover, Goldsmith left to form his own bank after <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter </italic>acquired <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Hannover. After joining the Board of <italic>Nationalbank</italic> in 1918, Goldsmith negotiated a syndicate agreement between <italic>Nationalbank</italic> and the struggling <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, culminating in their full merger in 1923 to form <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter Nationalbank</italic> (\u201c<italic>Danat</italic>\u201d), Germany\u2019s second-largest commercial bank and banker to <italic>Stinnes</italic> <italic>Siemens</italic> and GGE.\nAmidst Goldsmith\u2019s success, <italic>Disconto</italic>\u2019s Solmssen\u2014the assimilated and converted son of Katz-cousin Luria descendant Adolph Salomonsohn\u2014regarded Goldsmith a parasitic marketer. <italic>Disconto</italic> relocated her Antwerp branch, <italic>Bary Michaelis</italic>, to Amsterdam, joined by <italic>Berliner</italic>. Expressing interest in collaboration as early as 1920, <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> London formalized credit arrangements by mid-1921. \n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of the Banker Social Class</italic>\nThe combination of mixed-religion marriages and antisemitism in the twilight of the 19th century accelerated banking as an activity not of religion, but of social class. From the Middle Ages through the 19th century, Christian moral teachings and social hierarchy shaped distrust toward profit-making and lending. Overtime, lending through merchant banking gained acceptance and status due to its ties to elite families and foreign finance.\nSince France abolished tariffs in1904, SG <italic>Belge </italic>reorganized <italic>Parisienne </italic>with investment from the Huguenot<italic> Mallet</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Mirabaud</italic>, <italic>Neuflize</italic>, <italic>Vernes</italic>, <italic>Creusot</italic>\u2019s <italic>Schneider</italic><italic>,</italic> <italic>Heine</italic>, and<italic> Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic> soon rivaled <italic>Paribas</italic> and became the French investment bank of choice for <italic>Creusot</italic> and <italic>Shell</italic>. Immediately after forming, <italic>Parisienne</italic> then set out on a strategy with which she eventually branched to 34 cities across the Ottoman Empire, Greece, Ukraine, and Egypt, controlling most of the leading Balkan banks within a decade. By 1904, <italic>Parisienne </italic>invested in <italic>Bank of Athens</italic>, which the Chiot diaspora shipping banker cousin-in-laws started in 1893. \nAlthough mostly Huguenot, <italic>Parisienne </italic>had some descendants of converted Court Jews. William Eichthal married a Mirabaud in 1895, he became one of <italic>Mirabaud</italic>\u2019s six directors for decades from 1904. Eichthal was also a <italic>Heine</italic> cousin<italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>Since <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Berlin kinterlinked with fellow converts <italic>Heine</italic> in the 1830s, Heines kinterlinked with aristocrats and Foulds, with the brothers Armand and Michel Heine taking over <italic>Fould Oppenheim</italic>, renamed <italic>Heine</italic> Paris, in 1875. While joining BDF\u2019s Court in 1890, the Heine brothers died by 1904, the former head of <italic>Heine</italic> New Orleans, Alfred Bechmann, a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s uncle, took over as Managing Partner of <italic>Heine</italic> Paris and added his relatives to the firm, and co-founded <italic>Parisienne</italic>. \nBechmann\u2019s brother was an engineer who founded the Special Office of Consulting Engineers in 1897\u2014dealing with urban water and sanitation issues\u2014and served as VP of <italic>Chemin de fer Nord-Sud de Paris</italic> from 1904. Within a year, laws protecting French Appellations d\u2019Origine in the traditional-Huguenot Cognac stronghold, but fraud and non-recognition remained prevalent. Several months after his aristocrat cousin-in-law wed a Thellusson descendant in 1907, <italic>Heine</italic>\u2019s Alfred Bechmann<italic> </italic>became a Director of <italic>Comptoir</italic>. \nSince Armand Heine married New Orleans banker Joachim Kohn\u2019s daughter in 1860, Kohn\u2019s nephew married <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels heiress Eugenie Oppenheim Emden, and her sister wed Jacques Reinach, her second cousin once removed through Rothschild cousins Schnapper. Soon after, <italic>Reinach</italic> bank of Paris became <italic>Kohn Reinach</italic> under Senior Partner Jacques Reinach. However, he committed suicide during the copper cartel crash in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>. In 1912, Reinach\u2019s Adolphe grandson married Marguerite Dreyfu\u00df, whose uncle Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df was exonerated in 1906 after twelve years of wrongful imprisonment. \nOctave Homberg Jr was another <italic>Parisienne</italic> director of Jewish ancestry. For a long time, the only Jews in Le Havre, his third great-grandmother, widow Suzanne Gomperz Homberg, whose niece married Moses Mendelssohn, grew <italic>Homberg</italic> trader internationally after the death of her husband. Despite years of seeking naturalization, she died in 1775, leading the family to begin slave trading and convert to Catholicism in 1785, inheriting their fortunes, and kinterlinking with Christians to become a large BDF shareholder by 1806. \nSuzanne second great-grandson, Octave Homberg, became General Director of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and Censor of BDF from 1891 until his death in 1907. Octave\u2019s daughter, Octave Jr\u2019s sister married Pierre Caillaux, a second cousin of  politician Joseph Caillaux. The son of a Catholic former leader of Ministry of Finance (\u201cMOF\u201d) and, through his mother, a member of a Norman Huguenot banking family, Joseph Caillaux had served as MOF Minister intermittently since 1902.\nOctave\u2019s son, Octave Jr, was <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s Secretary-General. Encouraged by MOF, <italic>Indochine</italic> shifted focus to Djibouti in 1909 to introduce the French <italic>franc</italic> into the economy and facilitate <italic>Djibouti-Addis Ababa</italic> RR. After leading negotiations and installing his brother-in-law, Ren\u00e9 Chaume, into his position, Octave Jr left to become VP of <italic>Parisienne</italic>. In addition, to the Chilean longitudinal railway project, Homberg negotiated with Russia and Serbia. \nThe Mallets, related to the Pereires, also connected <italic>Parisienne</italic> to Jewish France. During the growth of <italic>Transatlantique</italic> in 1884, a Mallet married a Thurneyssen, whose Rhon\u00e9 cousin\u2014both descended from Emile Pereire\u2014wed a LaRoche. By 1905, LaRoche\u2019s daughter married <italic>Worms</italic>\u2019 Michel Silny. Before Jacques Pereire married Fould cousin and <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> heiress<italic> </italic>Ad\u00e8le Halphen Dupont in 1904, Ren\u00e9 Fould\u2014a cousin-in-law of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>\u2019s Emile Rodrigues Pereire\u2014married Esther Lazard in 1900. Since Marie Cerf married Isaac Orchel\u2019s grandson Isaac Silny in 1812, their daughter married Orly Worms\u2019 nephew Hypolite in 1837. Meanwhile, Marie Cerf\u2019s second cousin Esther Cerf Aron wed Abraham Lazard\u2019s son Elie in 1820, and their son Elie Jr married Isaac\u2019s cousin Marie Silny in 1867. \nIn 1906, <italic>Parisienne</italic> appointed \u00c9dward Cahen-Fuzier as head of the Secretariat, and he became deputy director in 1912. His father\u2019s first wife, Rodrigues, was a cousin-in-law of the Cerf, Aron, and Lazard family, and a second cousin once removed of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>\u2019s Jacob Pereire. \u00c9dward was a financial journalist, managing bulletins that promoted securities for <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic> and <italic>Lyonnais</italic>. By 1900, he married the daughter of jurisconsult Edouard Fuzier-Herman, hyphenating her name to his. Descended from a Huguenot minister, Edouard\u2019s prefect father converted to Catholicism after marrying Pauline Herman. After Pauline\u2019s French diplomat grandfather served as Consul General in London, her father served as a prefect, Secretary General of the Ministry of the Interior, and later became a member of the Council of State and Senate under Napoleon III.\nWhile Suzanne Gunzburg Fould had married Raoul Gradis in 1888, her father\u2019s family connected the Pereire and Rodrigues families. In 1845, <italic>Eichthal </italic>in-law Anna Rodrigues married engineer Ernest Go\u00fcin, of a Christian Touraine banking family that had kinterlinked with nobility. While Ernest founded rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> in Clichy and Mulhouse with funding from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Pereire</italic>, and <italic>Eichthal </italic>in 1847, his second cousin Eug\u00e8ne co-founded <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1870 and became Chair in 1895. \nSoon after <italic>Paribas</italic> formed in 1870, Charles Rodrigues Go\u00fcin married a niece-in-law of Flore Oppenheim Ratisbonne, whose niece wed Charles Demachy, the son of Catholic banker <italic>Demachy Seilli\u00e8re</italic>. Following the death of Eug\u00e8ne Go\u00fcin, Demachy was Chair for a year until his death in 1911. During this time, <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Managing Director was Geneva-born Albert Turrettini. He was the son of a banker and mayor of Cologny, and his mother was a great-niece of Jacques Necker, Finance Minister to King Louis XVI. While he built a career at <italic>Union Financi\u00e8re de Gen\u00e8ve</italic>, Albert married a Mirabaud and their daughter wed a Mallet in 1901. \nDescended from another co-founder of <italic>Paribas</italic>, Maurice Bischoffsheim married a Thellusson descendant in 1902, but he died by 1904. Through <italic>Rothschild</italic>,<italic> Paribas</italic> also grew closer to <italic>Heine</italic> and oil bankers. While Alice Lambert\u2019s great niece married the great niece of <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels\u2019 Corn\u00e9lie Oppenheim Emden\u2014whose daughters married Kohn and Reinach\u2014in 1904, Alice\u2019s brother-in-law Robert Rothschild married the granddaughter of Eugenie Oppenheim Emden and Eduard Kohn in 1907. Alice\u2019s son with Raphael Bauer of <italic>Paribas</italic> Brussels. Robert, joined <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 board in 1895, married the Katz-descendant Marguerita Goldschmidt Gunzburg in 1907, and became Sous Directeur of <italic>Paribas</italic> Brussels in 1908. \nLikewise, <italic>Paribas</italic> promoted Katz-descendant Horace Finaly. Following the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Horace\u2019s father Hugo\u2014a Hungarian-born nephew of Horace Landau, a director of <italic>Morpurgo</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Black Sea agent after the <italic>Crimean War</italic>\u2014joined <italic>Paribas</italic> Amsterdam to examine American railroad securities. While Finaly\u2019s daughters converted and wed French aristocrats\u2014including Ernest Barbarin in 1897 and Henri Cossette in 1903\u2014his son <italic>Horace </italic>attended the <italic>Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet</italic> and studied law before joining <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1900. In 1905, he traveled to South America for financial negotiations and, in 1907, toured Russia, Japan, and America to secure bond flotations, becoming Director in 1908.\nMore generally, French banking kinterlinks were exercised through religion, including godfathers of baptism, witnesses of marriage, charitable works, and informal encounters. While Catholicism predominated among administrators, half of BDF were Protestant Huguenots. Although <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> had no Jewish managers, while <italic>Comptoir</italic> and <italic>Lyonnais</italic> had one each. Moreover, both the London branches of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Lyonnais</italic> employed non-Frenchmen. \n<italic>Comptoir</italic> had hired Emile Oulman. Born in Frankfurt, Oulman was Jacob Schiff\u2019s extended cousin and his brother married Rothschild\u2019s Sichel cousin in 1870. After joining <italic>Comptoir</italic> Brussels in 1875, he transferred to <italic>Comptoir</italic> Paris in 1879. Oulman was appointed Head of the Foreign Department in 1882 and Secretary-General in 1890. He joined the Board of Directors in 1905 and was made Vice-Chair of <italic>Comptoir</italic> and received the <italic>L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur</italic> in 1908. \n<italic>Lyonnais</italic> had appointed James Rosselli to head her London branch in 1889 after he founded stockbrokerage <italic>Rosselli</italic><italic> </italic>in London. Rosselli was born into a Davidic Sephardi family of Livorno and Rome that gained wealth from the industrial development of Tuscan mercury deposits and kinterlinked with the family of Baron Levi of Florence. <italic>Rosselli</italic><italic> </italic>continued to engage with Christians, hiring, in the 1920s, John Bigelow Dodge, a great nephew of Anson Phelps Dodge, whose mother married a cousin of Winston Churchill-Spencer.\nWhen Rosselli became Executive Director in 1895, Eug\u00e8ne Karminski replaced him as Manager. Eugene Karminski was born in German Posen to a merchant who co-founded a steam-powered flour mill and whose sister married a cousin-in-law of the Laski Frankel, Bondi, and Geldern families. He began his career at <italic>Weisweiller</italic> in Paris and later joined <italic>Lyonnais</italic>. In 1887, he was sent to Barcelona to establish and manage a <italic>Lyonnais</italic> branch, and remained until 1895.\nAt <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, Charles Laudour ran the London branch from 1894 to 1916, when Scotsman Alexander Blaikley, directed the branch. Blaikley joined <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> London in 1894, becoming manager from 1916 to his death 1945. He came from an intermarried religious sect, the non-conformist Sandemanians, which included aritsts\u2014like Blaikley\u2019s father\u2014and scientists such Michael Faraday. \nThe Blaikleys kinterlinked with the Waterstons, a family that included Charles, a general manager of <italic>Caledonian Bank</italic> at Inverness from the 1840s until the 1880s, and his brother William, managed <italic>Bank of Australasia</italic> in London. Their sister wed a brother of James Walker, who joined <italic>Bank of New South Wales</italic> in 1859, became general manager of <italic>Royal Bank of Queensland</italic> in 1885, and was President of <italic>Bank of New South Wales</italic> from 1899 to 1901, remaining director until 1921.\nThe tying of banking to social class stifled individual freedoms to the will of the family. By then, progressive joint-stock British banks, like the joint general manager of <italic>National Provincial Bank</italic>, who expressed their acceptance of female shareholders and openness to acquiring new accounts, exemplified by <italic>Midland Bank</italic>. Perhaps the most successful female investor was Hetty Howland Robinson Green, who, for many years, was a stockholder and depositor at <italic>Chemical</italic> NB, where she also maintained an office before switching to <italic>Seaboard</italic> NB. During the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, she made large loans from New York to Texas.\nBorn into the influential Quaker Mott and whaling Russell Howland families of Massachusetts, Hetty Howland Robinson attended a private school in Boston run by Reverend Charles Russell Lowell and his wife Anna Cabot. After inheriting a fortune from her father in 1865, she married silk merchant Henry Green. Born in Vermont, Green became a clerk for <italic>Russell Sturgis</italic> in New York and was sent to the Philippines, where he became a partner in the firm. He then expanded his ventures to Hong Kong, where his investments in trading amassed a fortune. While Hetty managed her fortune with the help of financial advisors, Green\u2019s bankruptcy led to their separation. Still, she became the richest woman in the world and left a larger inheritance than John Morgan in 1916. Hetty\u2019s daughter married an Astor in 1909.\nRussian antisemitism from 1882, along with corporate consolidations from the 1890s, accelerated wealthy and high caste Jewish arranged marriages, strengthening the economic influence of the trans-national Jewish cousinhood over national and patriotic views. For using their wealth and influence to emancipate Jews and combat antisemitism, such \u2018International World Jewry\u2019 became antisemitic targets for.\nFrom then, Haskalah ideas criticized traditional arranged marriages as outdated commercial transactions. Facing lower financial stakes, artisans and poorer Jews in Eastern European had more freedom to marry for love at older ages. As these ideas spread, more young people from mixed classes began favoring romantic courtship and love-based marriages, challenging religious traditions.\nGender and class also intersected in new ways. In Russia, unlike Rosalia Vydrin Polyakov and earlier generations, her daughters and other third generation Polyakov women did not engage in commerce. Despite his waning religiosity, <italic>Commercial Bank of Minsk</italic>\u2019s Vice Director Chonon Wengeroff did not allow his Luria-Epstein wife to bank although her Gunzburg and Zak in-laws propelled his career. Since Russian law did not allow mixed religion marriages, Polyakovs turned to salons to build bridges with Christians. However, unlike the Jewish salons in Old Regime Berlin that included both Jewish and Christian attendees, late 19th century Russian literary salons were vital platforms for developing language and culture instead of bridges.\nMales too were captive. Russia\u2019s Polyakovs disinherited several heirs for improper marriages. After John Morgan\u2019s nephew married Japanese geisha Yuki Kato in 1904, his family ostracized the couple, and they moved to Paris, though he was not disinherited. While sugar magnate Berza Brodsky married a Gunzburg in Kiew, he wasted his fortune with bisexual dalliances with entertainers. <italic>Sassoon</italic> virtually disinherited Gunzburg\u2019s brother-in-law Albert Sassoon for marrying into the Thornycrafts, Christian British artisans. With Albert dying soon after, the Thornycrafts raised his son Siegfried, who was a celebrated poet about bisexuality from the front lines of WWI.\nWhile Jean Rougemont was arrested in Paris for public homosexual acts in the 1720s before turning 20, his son from his third wife later joined him to develop one of France\u2019s most enduring financial dynasties. Other lives were cut short. In Philadelphia, Benedict Gimbel was arrested for the \u2018serious charge\u2019 of sodomy, leading him to attempt suicide. Before doctors failed to revive him, his family hoped to combat the charges by pleading insanity and institutionalizing him in an asylum. Media coverage appeared manipulated, with allegations of suppression in Philadelphia and attempts by a New York paper to exploit the story for circulation. \nOther times, from America to Europe, including the children of aristocrats, <italic>Drexel</italic>, <italic>Singer</italic>, and <italic>Barney</italic> (started by Jay Cooke\u2019s son-in-law), entered \u2018lavender\u2019 marriages with other homosexual heirs in often unconsummated marriages and engaged in extra-marital affairs with varying degrees of discretion. Although sodomy had long been illegal in Britain, aristocratic homosexuals became more open in the 1890s. Since Marc Wertheim Rafalovich immigrated from Paris to London, he became romantically involved with John Gray, on whom their mutual friend Oscar Wilde based his fictional character Dorian Gray. When a homophobic campaign led many gays to flee to Paris in 1895, Rafalovich converted to Catholicism like his mother and sister, but remained involved with Gray until death in the 1930s. \nWhile the daughter of <italic>Morgan</italic> London\u2019s Burns married an aristocratic around whom rumors often swirled,, another homophobic scandal alleged homosexual offenses by 30 upper-class men by 1902, included Cyril Flower and King Edward VII\u2019s brother-in-law, the Duke of Argyll. Since marrying Constance Rothschild, Cyril continued his father\u2019s development and engaged in politics. Only intervention by PM Balfour and King Edward prevented the case from proceeding, protecting Cyril and his associates from public exposure and consequences. Amidst the scandal, Constance did not run for re-election of a philanthropic endeavor but continued her advocacy for women\u2019s suffrage even after Cyril\u2019s death in 1907. In this work, Constance collaborated with philosopher Beatrice Webb, a gentry sister-in-law of <italic>Huth</italic>\u2019s Meinertzhagen family.\nWhile poor British men used wife sales and public auctions until the 1910s, wealthy and religious parents controlled marriage until family partnerships shifted to corporate capitalism. But the shift was slow and NYSE rules prevented securities firms from going public until the 1970s. So heirs married. Born to a British shipping magnate and a New York merchant prince, Florence Jaffray Hurst married a nephew of UPR\u2019s Harriman, and co-founded <italic>Colony Club</italic>\u2014the first female social clubhouse in New York soon attended by <italic>Morgan</italic> wives\u2014and led a women\u2019s suffrage parade down 5th Avenue by 1902. Moreover, Henrietta\u2019s cousin, fellow Boston Brahmin Frances Perkins became a reformer. As the executive secretary of New York\u2019s Consumers League, she addressed working conditions, especially for women and children. \nBut the relationship between Marxism and women\u2019s rights was nuanced. Clara Zetkin, a Protestant born in Saxony, and Rosa Luxemburg, a secular Katz descendant from Austrian Galicia, were key figures in the establishment of International Women\u2019s Day. Zetkin proposed the holiday at the International Socialist Women\u2019s Conference of 1910, focusing on women\u2019s suffrage. Despite resistance from male Marxists, the first celebration occurred on March 19, 1911, in Germany, on the anniversary of the 1848 promise by Kaiser Frederick William IV to grant reforms.   In America, after the 1911 <italic>Triangle Shirtwaist</italic> factory fire killed 145 people\u2014mostly Jewish young women\u2014Frances Perkins pushed for safety standards and directed sweatshop studies.\nSo did the Jewish Cinderella. Born into poverty in a Russian shtetel, Rose Wieslander Pastor\u2019s mother fled the pogroms of 1882, reaching America soon after. Making cigars in a sweatshop for fifteen years, Rose submitted poems during her free time and became a journalist for <italic>Yiddish Daily</italic>. During an interview she met James Phelps Stokes. Two years after Stokes earned medical degrees from <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic> in 1896, he became President of <italic>Nevada Central</italic> RR. Marrying in 1905, they worked for labor rights, with Stokes serving as President of <italic>Intercollegiate Socialist Society</italic> from 1907. A year after marching for safety standards in 1911, Rose helped hotel workers strike against August Belmont Jr.\nNot allowing women on the trading floor, <italic>Morgan</italic> only invited wives to the bank when it was closed on New Year\u2019s Day. John Morgan\u2019s commitment to the institution of marriage as a reflection of his perception of relationships outside of his banking career. Despite not adhering strictly to societal conventions, Morgan believed in upholding a stable and conservative image as a merchant banker. He refrained from divorce, not only due to his wife\u2019s feelings but also to preserve her social standing and self-esteem. That almost failed in 1915. \nWhen <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>\u2019s Davison became <italic>Morgan</italic> Partner in 1909, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Lamont followed by 1911. After learning that Davison had an extramarital affair with his neighbor, the wife of Howard Boocock, Treasurer of <italic>Astor Trust</italic>, Howard shot his wife to death and committed suicide. The secrecy surrounding the affair for decades spared <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s reputation but had significant personal consequences for Davison.\nOnly with the boom of post-WWI socialism and nativism did Congress legalize female suffrage in America. As women joined the labor-force, <italic>free love</italic> freed children, fractured capital, and accelerated cultural assimilation. By the 1920s, Ellin Duer Mackay spurned her wealthy Catholic father to marry Russian Jewish jazz songwriter Irving Berlin in a marriage that ended only with death over six decades later.\nSuch a turn around coincided with the reckoning of the Court Jew system in the wake of the <italic>Panic of 1914</italic> Although naturalized since 1884, awarded the <italic>L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur</italic> in 1908, and the father of a son fighting against the Germans, Emile Oulman was forced to resign from <italic>Comptoir</italic> after 1915. Instead, Franco-American Jews linked without Germans. \nSince Marie Cerf married Isaac Orchel\u2019s grandson Isaac Silny in 1812, their daughter married Orly Worms\u2019 nephew Hypolite in 1837. Meanwhile, Marie Cerf\u2019s second cousin Esther Cerf Aron wed Abraham Lazard\u2019s son Elie in 1820, and their son Elie Jr married Isaac\u2019s cousin Marie Silny in 1867. By 1913, Isaac Silny\u2019s cousin twice removed wed Isidor Wormzer\u2019s daughter. Isidor\u2019s father was born in German Landau and immigrated to America and engaging in the California trade before establishing New York bank in 1870. Isidor married Angie Lauer, whose siblings wed NYSE broker Albert Goodhart, <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s Philip Lehman, and <italic>Kuhn</italic> cousin Jennie Seasongood. Having married the daughter of a Welsh Mayor of Cardiff in 1912, Hypolite Worms\u2019 baptized grandson Hypolite II became head of shipping and banking firm <italic>Worms</italic> in 1916, which grew tremendously during the war.\nBy August 1915, Octave Homberg, a converted director at <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Franco-Serbian Bank</italic>, Ernest Mallet, a Huguenot Regent of BDF, and  <italic>Franco-Suisse Bank</italic>\u2019 Koechlin-in-law Albert Rossier served as delegates alongside British representatives in New York with <italic>Brown</italic> and other banks. As they sought to secure French and British credit balances in America to stabilize exchange rates, NB\u2019s unfamiliarity with foreign acceptances slowed negotiations.\nAs FRS <italic>New York</italic> promoted acceptances, international French banks financed trade. Without London\u2019s system of discount and acceptance houses and bill broker, Parisian banks had created money market for government defense bills. While the large banks were reluctant to deal with long-term CP that BDF did not re-discountable, the merchant banks preferred long-term financing to discounting CP, and only two banks, <italic>Transatlantique</italic> and <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise et Italienne</italic>, specialized in negotiations with foreign countries. \nEstablishing a New York agency to manage War Department purchases and negotiate loans from local banks, Homberg appointed Jean Bloch-Lain\u00e9 as deputy to the French financial delegate in London. Born in Paris, Bloch was a converted grandnephew of socialist politician L\u00e9on Blum, a fifth great nephew of Cerf Berr, and a fourth great grandson of Olry Worms. After earning a law degree, he became an Inspector of Finance, and married the Christian Georgette Lain\u00e9, hyphenating her surname with his.\nBy then, Fran\u00e7ois Wendel, a descendant of Thellusson, became a Regent of BDF in 1913 and President of <italic>Comit\u00e9 des Forges</italic> iron cartel from 1918. Alexandre Caen Millerand\u2014whose wife was a sister-in-law of Octave Homberg Jr\u2019s cousin\u2014became the first French President of Jewish origin. Although France founded the state-controlled <italic>French National Bank for Foreign Trade</italic> in 1920, only industrial groups like <italic>Wendel</italic> and a few large banks funded her. After France named him a Knight of the Legion of Honor for his debt management, Bloch-Lain\u00e9 he served as General Director of <italic>French Co for North America</italic> to develop financial and commercial relations with America until he became General Director of <italic>Transatlantique </italic>and<italic> </italic>a partner from <italic>French National Bank for Foreign Trade </italic>in 1924.\nThe societal upheaval and the focus on the war effort diverted attention and resources, disrupting the patterns established in the preceding decades and temporarily halting the trend of mixed marriages and alliances. Similarly, as Jewish marriage alliances with the Christian aristocracy stagnated in Paris after WWI, marriages with the Christian bourgeoisie continued growing. \nOnly in 1918 did Simone Lazard, a daughter of the divorced Lucie Goldschmidt and Andr\u00e9 Lazard, a son of one of the five founding brothers, marry a French Catholic aristocrat Paul Fressange, who soon joined the board of <italic>Comptoir du Maroc </italic>under President Gaston Gunzburg Gradis. While his father Serge had directed <italic>Foundries of Paris and the Seine</italic>, <italic>Paper Mills of Aubeterre & Pont-Vieux</italic>, and <italic>Electric Steelworks of Paris & the Seine</italic> before WWI, Paul\u2019s uncle, Marquis Henri Fressange, was involved with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> and <italic>Porto Rico</italic> RR around the turn of the century. The same year, Gaston Gradis married coreligionist Georgette Deutsch-Meurthe. Serving as an artillery officer in WWI, after the war Gaston led the family firm <italic>Gradis</italic>, which became <italic>French </italic><italic>Co </italic><italic>for Trade with the Colonies </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Abroad</italic>.\nLike <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris invested heavily in international trade. Since Moyse Rheims, likely a cousin through the Foulds, married Esther Lazard\u2019s niece M\u00e9lanie Aron in 1865, their son Jean married Louis Louis-Dreyfu\u00df\u2019s daughter around 1915. Jean Rheims subsequently became a Director of <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic>, Europe\u2019s largest grain trader. Another son, WWI hero Leon, later became Brigadier General. While one Rheims cousin married Paul Ettinghausen, a descendant of Aisik Orchel, who became a director of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, another had wed a Fatman, whose American cousin married a Lehman in 1888, making their daughter a cousin-in-law of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul and, from 1916, the wife of American <italic>Food Administration</italic> executive Henry Morgenthau Jr.\nAs BDF\u2019s FX agent, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris opened a branch in Mainz to pay the salaries of French occupation troops during WWI. After the war, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris closed the Mainz branch and opened a new <italic>Lazard</italic> Basel. Despite this, Huguenot bankers, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris did not invite <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris to BDF\u2019s <italic>Council of Regency</italic>, seeing her as too willing to sacrifice the French <italic>franc</italic>, especially since the <italic>Dreyfu\u00df Affair</italic> of the 1890s. \nWithout <italic>Lazard</italic> male heirs, Alexandre\u2019s son, David Weill led <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris with equity in the other branches. In 1920, Weill\u2019s daughter married Roger Seligmann\u2014who was a great nephew of the brother of <italic>Bischoffsheim </italic><italic>Goldschmidt</italic>-in-law and<italic> Paribas</italic> co-founder Henri Bamberger, cousin twice removed married a Rothschild, and second cousin of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Otto Kahn.\nAt the time, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris partners were cousins David Weill, Michel Lazard, Andr\u00e9 Lazard, and Thibault Lazard Weill Cahn. That year, they named Raymond Philippe as the first non-family member to be co-opted as a full partner, having joined <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris before 1914 and married a Goudchaux cousin as a messenger without formal education. \nLikewise, they appointed Georges Wormser as a non-partner Director with sole signing authority, recruited for his political connections, having served as a secretary for Georges Clemenceau during WWI, been part of the French delegation at the <italic>Treaty of Versailles</italic>, and later becoming Chief of Staff to the President of the Council. Wormser\u2019s son married a Lazard cousin soon after.\nWeill\u2019s distant cousin, non-Katz-descendant Emmanuel Weill, was the Chief Rabbi of Versailles, maternal grandson of a representative at Napoleon\u2019s Grand Sanhedrin, and married the daughter of the Rabbi of Saverne and sister of Chief Rabbi of Belgium. While two of Rabbi Emmanuel Weil\u2019s daughters married Paris bank <italic>Baur</italic> heirs, his son Edouard married Edm\u00e9e, a great-granddaughter of Katz-descendant Babette Wahl Netter (an extended cousin of <italic>Kuhn</italic> affiliate Jacob Netter) and Leyser Cerf. While his cousin Marie Cerf married Gar\u00e7on Silny\u2019s son in 1812, Leyser\u2019s second cousin Esther Cerf Aron wed Abraham Lazard\u2019s son Elie in 1820, and their son Elie Jr married Gar\u00e7on\u2019s niece Marie Silny in 1867. \nAlthough Edouard secured a position at <italic>Baur</italic> through his in-laws, he was conscripted to war in 1914. His brother-in-law and Edm\u00e9e\u2019s brother, Andr\u00e9 Meyer, a <italic>Paris Stock Exchange</italic> runner, possibly having lied about his age, claimed a heart condition and his role as the sole provider for his family to avoid military service and replaced Edouard at <italic>Baur</italic>. Three years after Edouard\u2019s niece married Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df\u2019s son in 1919, Meyer married a fellow Katz cousin, whose banker father had died earlier. Soon after, Meyer impressed David Weill of <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, whom he joined as an associate in 1926 and rising to partner alongside Weill\u2019s son Pierre in 1927. \nSince Marie Cerf married Isaac Berr\u2019s grandson Isaac Silny, Isaac Silny\u2019s cousin once removed \u00c9lieser worked as a banker in Metz, and was appointed a director of <italic>Chemins de fer de l\u2019Ouest-Alg\u00e9rien</italic> in 1879 and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Alg\u00e9rien</italic> in 1881. \u00c9lieser\u2019s brother Moyse banked in Paris and was a President of <italic>Forges et Aci\u00e9ries du Nord et de l\u2019Est</italic> from 1895. By then, Isaac Silny\u2019s daughter married Hypolite Worms of Alsace. Partnering with Silny cousins since the 1860s to transport British coal to France, Hypolite\u2019s baptized grandson of the same name expanded <italic>Worms</italic>, becoming involved in various companies and boards of directors, including those connected to <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris.\nAs Worms\u2019 bank grew and funded French shipping and other ventures, Moyse Silny\u2019s son, connected with <italic>Lazard</italic>, married Isidor Wormser\u2019s daughter in 1913. Isidor\u2019s father was born in German Landau and immigrated to America and engaging in trade around California before establishing New York bank in 1870. Isidor married Angie Lauer, whose siblings wed Albert Goodhart, Philip Lehman, and Jennie Seasongood.\nMoreover, the clan helped France refocus on Indochina. From southwest France, the Sarraut family wielded significant influence through their ownership of <italic>La D\u00e9p\u00eache</italic>, one of the most influential regional newspapers. In 1911, Albert Sarraut was appointed Governor-General of Indochina, where he initiated reforms reshaping colonial administration during his two terms from 1911-14 and 1917-9. Working with Homberg for development, he introduced a two-track educational system and created provincial assemblies in Annam and Tonkin. After returning to France in 1919, Sarraut served as Minister of Colonies until 1924, where he advocated for the economic development of French colonies.\nSince Octave Homberg Jr negotiated <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s American loan to France in 1914 before leaving <italic>Parisienne</italic> in 1916, he rejoined <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s board and founded <italic>French & Colonial </italic>HC, with <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Raymond Philippe and Weill, <italic>Worms</italic>\u2019 Hypolite Worms, and <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Maxime Grammont as directors by 1919. As <italic>French & Colonial </italic>invested in Indochinese rubber, sugar, coal and metal mines, banking, and public utilities, plus further ventures in French Africa and Madagascar, Homberg became President of <italic>Indochina Water & Electricity </italic>and <italic>Indochinese Electricity</italic>, Octave collaborated with <italic>Indochine</italic> to establish <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier Indochinois</italic> in 1923. Octave\u2019s cousin, Andre Homberg, joined <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> in 1919 as General Manager and was Chair from 1922. Homberg\u2019s Christian in-law Hector Bouret-Aubertot served as President of <italic>Eastern Algerian</italic> RR, Director of <italic>Magnetic Iron Ore Co</italic> of Mokta-El-Hadid, and a director of colonial water companies.\nWhile Georges Heine was a Regent of BDF from 1914, <italic>Heine</italic> Paris Managing Partner Alfred Bechmann\u2019s son Guy wed Maud Dreyfus in 1918 and became a Director of <italic>Comptoir Fran\u00e7ais du Maroc</italic>, under President Gaston Gunzburg Gradis alongside Rene Dreyfus and Paul Fressange. French Catholic aristocrat Fressange married Simone Goldschmidt Lazard in 1918. While his father had directed <italic>Foundries of Paris and the Seine</italic>, <italic>Paper Mills of Aubeterre & Pont-Vieux</italic>, and <italic>Electric Steelworks of Paris & the Seine</italic> before WWI, Fressange\u2019s uncle, a Marquis, was involved with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> and <italic>Porto Rico</italic> RR at the turn of the century.  \nSince Suzanne Gunzburg Fould had married Raoul Gradis in 1888, her father\u2019s family connected the Pereire and Rodrigues families. In 1845, <italic>Eichthal </italic>in-law Anna Rodrigues married engineer Ernest Go\u00fcin, of a Christian Touraine banking family that had kinterlinked with nobility. While Ernest founded rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> in Clichy and Mulhouse with funding from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Pereire</italic>, and <italic>Eichthal </italic>in 1847, his second cousin Eug\u00e8ne co-founded <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1870 and became Chair in 1895. \nSoon after <italic>Paribas</italic> formed, Charles Rodrigues Go\u00fcin married a niece-in-law of Flore Oppenheim Ratisbonne. While Flore\u2019s niece wed Charles Demachy, who inherited leadership of Catholic bank <italic>Demachy Seilli\u00e8re</italic> in 1888, Flore\u2019s aunt had married a Haber banker, whose niece married Jean Ganay in 1888. A descendant of Christian French aristocrats and Astor-cousin Willings of Philadelphia, Ganay\u2019s brother Ernest married a Schneider in 1896. By 1921, Jean Ganay children married Argentine heiress Rosita Bemberg\u2014whose brother had married into the Oissel family connected to <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9</italic> <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>and <italic>Saint-Gobain</italic>\u2014and Ernest Go\u00fcin\u2019s great granddaughter Lucienne. Over the next few years, Lucienne\u2019s siblings married a Gunzburg Fould Gradis and David Weill\u2019s cousin once removed.\nBefore succeeding his father Alfred Bechman as Managing Partner of <italic>Heine</italic> and Director of <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Bank of Syria & Lebanon</italic>, and other institutions in the 1930s, Ren\u00e9 was a director of <italic>French Co for Colonial Studies & Enterprises</italic> and <italic>French General Co of Latin America</italic>. While <italic>Co for Colonial </italic>started in 1905 to focus on colonial industrial and financial affairs, <italic>Co of Latin America</italic> started in 1918 with agencies in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil. <italic>Co of Latin America</italic> negotiated with the Brazilian government to supply artillery and explored ventures in coffee and cotton exports and steel industry projects. <italic>Wendel</italic>\u2019s <italic>Comit\u00e9 des Forges </italic>cartel, <italic>Cotonnier de l\u2019Est</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Parisienne</italic> founded <italic>French Co of the Far East</italic> in 1917 with branches in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, Indochina, China, Japan, and Siam. \nAfter Germany annexed Alsace following the <italic>Franco-Prussian War</italic> of 1870, <italic>Comptoir </italic>spun off <italic>Comptoir de Mulhouse</italic>, based in German Alsace but financed by French capital, faced political challenges. As<italic> Comptoir de Mulhouse</italic> fell under German control during WWI,  <italic>Comptoir de Mulhouse</italic>\u2019s French branches formed <italic>Nationale</italic> in 1913. After WWI, <italic>Comptoir de Mulhouse</italic> returned to French control and competed with <italic>Nationale</italic>. \nSince the early 1860s, the small Jewish firms of Raphael Dreyfu\u00df\u2014father of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df\u2014and <italic>Herzog Dreyfu\u00df Lantz</italic> started in Alsace. Among the largest of Jewish textiles in Mulhouse was Elie Lantz. Along with founding <italic>Banque de Mulhouse</italic> in 1867, Elie\u2019s son Lazare chaired <italic>Mulhouse Savings Bank</italic>. Lazare Lantz negotiated the Alsace-Lorraine customs regime with Otto Bismarck in 1871, earning the Legion of Honor. \nLantz served as President of <italic>Banque de Mulhouse</italic> from its early years until his death in 1909. While Eug\u00e8ne Favre led <italic>Banque de Mulhouse</italic> until death in 1918, Lazare\u2019s son Jean became President after. Leading <italic>Dreyfu\u00df Lantz</italic> with his brother-in-law since 1909, Jean became President of <italic>Strasbourg Forges</italic>. And, since <italic>Dreyfu\u00df </italic>Basel invested in Koechlin-in-law\u2019s <italic>Franco-Swiss Bank</italic> 1894, <italic>Franco-Swiss Bank </italic>collaborated with <italic>Brown</italic> of New York since WWI and merged with <italic>Aynard</italic> of Lyon and <italic>Caisse de Cr\u00e9dit de Nice</italic> to form <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic> in 1917.\nA descendant of Schlumbergers, Eug\u00e8ne Favre had married a Mieg, and their daughter married <italic>Suez Canal</italic> heir and director Bernard Lesseps in 1902. Through the 19th century, Pierre Schlumberger, Jean Thierry and Anne-Catherine Mieg, and Samuel Koechlin founded Alsatian textile enterprises. As their descendants kinterlinked, some expanded in textiles, while others diversified. One Thierry-Mieg descendant became a <italic>Parisienne</italic> representative in Egypt.\nBefore also dying in 1918, Eug\u00e8ne Favre\u2019s brother Gustave was a director of <italic>Nationale</italic><italic>, </italic>which took over thirty establishments, including <italic>Banque du Midi</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Centre</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Sud-Ouest</italic>, <italic>Banque de Nancy</italic>, and <italic>Banque de Metz</italic> to become France\u2019s fourth-largest deposit bank by 1922. Along with supporting industries such as aeronautics and cinema, <italic>Nationale </italic>engaged in Eastern Europe and Romanian oil through her acquisitions. <italic>Nationale </italic>is different from <italic>Cr\u00e9dit National</italic>, founded by MOF and major Parisian credit institutions to support post-WWI reconstruction efforts in 1919. Positioned alongside <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</italic>, it specialized in medium and long-term credit to facilitate industrial and commercial stability and growth.\nBy then, the Catholic <italic>P\u00e9rier</italic> declined in stature since co-founding BDF without regencies after 1868, as heirs refocused on politics, with one serving as a Minister of the Interior in the 1870s and another as President of the Republic in the 1890s. Following family conflicts and a controversy over funding Ottoman Empire before WWI, <italic>P\u00e9rier</italic> rebranded herself as <italic>Marchal</italic>, under P\u00e9rier in-law Charles Marchal and his Huguenot co-founder, Henry Bower, whose wife was a Boissevain cousin, in 1918. \nEarlier, <italic>Marchal</italic> invested in Nancy bank <italic>Renaud</italic> in 1913, which had invested in Alsatian and Lorraine Company for Mining Research which expanded mining from Alsace to Africa. Together, <italic>Marchal</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Renaud</italic> funded electricity ventures from Nord in 1914 to  Lorraine in 1919 as well as <italic>Banque du Rhin </italic>in Strasbourg in 1920. That same year, <italic>Marchal</italic> issued bonds for <italic>Tanneries de France</italic>, which absorbed the Jewish <italic>Adler Oppenheim</italic>, the largest leather business in Europe. By 1924, <italic>Marchal</italic> took over <italic>Banque Priv\u00e9e Lyonnaise</italic> and <italic>General Bank for Foreign Trade</italic>, soon gaining <italic>Banque d\u2019Alsace et de Lorraine</italic>.\nHowever, French electricity remained fragmented. Since 1895, the second generation of foreign companies in France grew significantly while maintaining local control. While locally controlled<italic> French</italic> <italic>Thomson Houston</italic> prevented GGE entry, and <italic>Traction</italic> established <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Industrielle d\u2019\u00c9lectricit\u00e9</italic> to separate her interests from <italic>Westinghouse</italic>. Key state sector recruits included Albert Petsche, , a cousin of Huguenot bankers, moved from Chief Engineer of Bridges & Roads to President of <italic>Union of Electricity</italic> and <italic>Parisian Electricity Co</italic>.\nBefore <italic>Paris Stock Exchange</italic> and MMMOF resumed in 1920, MOF, like in most countries, began to reorg PUs into a national network but ceased as fears of socialism spread. MOF reorganized coal BHCs and cartels, but local PU regulation underdeveloped rural and hydroelectricity. Born to Huguenots of Doubs, Ernest Mercier graduated from <italic>Polytechnique</italic> in 1912 and was recruited by co-religionist Albert Petsche to build a power plant in suburban Paris. With funds from <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, Mercier merged six suburban producers into <italic>Union d\u2019Electricit\u00e9</italic> PUHC in 1919, and oversaw the construction of world\u2019s most powerful thermal center in Gennevilliers by 1922. Mercier joined Fould and other industrialists and bankers on <italic>Cr\u00e9dit National</italic>\u2019s board. Expanding across Europe, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris cousins <italic>Worms </italic>engaged in the <italic>Franco-Polish Chamber of Commerce</italic> and joined <italic>Lyon Water & Lighting </italic>to found <italic>Norman Water, Gas & Electric </italic>by 1921.\nAlso in 1919, <italic>Electrique</italic> PUHC\u2019s Jean Boissonnas of Geneva wed Genevi\u00e8ve Mirabaud, becoming a Partner of <italic>Mirabaud</italic> and Director of <italic>Chargeurs R\u00e9unis Shipping</italic>. Likewise, Mirabaud\u2019s extended cousins, Alsace textile heirs Schlumbergers diversified into banking and industry. As Maurice Schlumberger founded <italic>Schlumberger</italic> bank in 1919, Conrad and another brother founded <italic>Schlumberger</italic> oil services with their father\u2019s support. Conrad was a physics professor interested in electrical resistance before he resigned from teaching in 1923 to focus on <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Prospection Electrique</italic>, which explored Romanian oil that year, but soon mostly focused<italic> </italic>on America and Soviet Azerbaijan and Chechnya. By then, the brothers\u2019 niece married into the Seydoux family, who moved from Switzerland to France in the early 19th century, became industrialists and politicians, and kinterlinked with the Peugeots and Koechlins, cousins of Mirabaud and Schlumberger.\nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, <italic>French Co of the Far East</italic> merged with <italic>French Co of Latin America</italic>, <italic>French Co of Eastern Europe</italic>, and <italic>French Co of Colonial Cotton</italic> from 1905, forming <italic>French Co of Commerce & Industry</italic> in 1922, with board directors <italic>Indochine</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Parisienne</italic>. <italic>French Co of Commerce & Industry </italic>was quickly acquired by <italic>Nationale</italic>. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and other major banks refused to provide a bailout for the note-issuing <italic>Industrial Bank of China</italic> in 1921, <italic>Paribas</italic> reorganized <italic>Industrial Bank of China</italic> into <italic>Chinoise</italic> without note issuance privileges. \nAmong <italic>Chinoise</italic>\u2019s early hires was Wladimir Archawski. Born in Geneva, Switzerland, to wealthy Jewish parents from Ukraine, Archawski worked at <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> in New York and Paris from 1920 until he became General Inspector at <italic>Chinoise </italic>in 1925. He was appointed Deputy General Director in 1926 and delegated Administrator of <italic>Transatlantic Bank</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Paribas</italic> further expanded her investments into Ethiopia, Tunisia, and Burma.\nSince Cognac-born Jean Monnet represented France in <italic>League of Nations </italic>after WWI, <italic>Versailles</italic> recognized Cognac and other geographic appellation monopolies. German wineries objected. To further protect the authenticity of Cognac, MOF criminalized false standard claims in 1919. During the crisis in 1922, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Kindersley made an unsecured loan to Monnet\u2019s brandy distilleries, before MOF eliminated cognac luxury taxes in 1923. However, Britain imposed a 33% ad valorem tax on champagne, which was eventually reduced but remained four times the pre-war level.\nBefore WWI, <italic>Shell</italic> entered the Romanian market by establishing <italic>Astra</italic>, in 1908. Initially considering cartel proposals from <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s <italic>Star</italic>, <italic>Shell</italic> later pursued independent development. By 1910, <italic>Shell</italic> acquired <italic>Regatul Roman</italic>, forming <italic>Astra Romana</italic>, the second-largest company in Romania, trailing only <italic>Star</italic>. As Britain and France were on different sides with Romania and Germany during WWI, <italic>Parisienne</italic> lost influence in <italic>Romanian Commercial Bank</italic>. Likewise,<italic> </italic>Turkey and Iran joined <italic>Deutsche</italic> and other German banks to seize <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>.\nThrough WWI, <italic>Bank of Athens </italic>operated effectively in Greece, allowing <italic>Parisienne</italic> to maintain control. During WWI, Basil Zaharoff worked closely with Britain and supported Eleftherios Venizelos during the 1916 coup in Salonika, helping Greece join the Allied cause in 1915. In 1917, Britain tasked Zaharoff with bribing Turkish leaders, including Enver Pasha, to secure an armistice. After the war, Zaharoff pursued oil concessions in Iraq.\nSince marrying Marie Silny in 1867, \u00c9lie Lazard co-founded <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in 1876. Their sons worked at the bank, including Michel Lazard who worked on Treasury operations during WWI. Having married the daughter of a Welsh Mayor of Cardiff, Hypolite Worms\u2019 baptized grandson and Silny cousin Hypolite II became head of <italic>Worms</italic> in 1916 and, towards the end of WWI, founded <italic>Maritime Shipyards of Le Trait</italic><italic> </italic>to build cargo ships. The company operated over 20 steamers and later reorganized <italic>Havre Peninsular Co</italic><italic> </italic>and founded <italic>French Petroleum Transport </italic><italic>Co</italic>. Becoming involved in various companies and boards of directors, including those connected to <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Worms</italic> grew and funded French shipping and other ventures.\nIn 1918, <italic>Deutsche</italic> tried to avoid share seizures by transferring her shares in the fully German <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR oil extension to the <italic>Deutsche</italic>-controlled <italic>Orient Bank</italic> in Switzerland. As the San Remo Conference portioned Turkey, Iraq gained independence, and Gulbenkian replaced <italic>Deutsche</italic> with France. However, <italic>Orient Bank </italic>retained the shares even as the Allies seized <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s shares in the<italic> ORIENT </italic>in which French <italic>TURK</italic> had a minority investment. \nAfter the war, British oil reorganized. Having consolidated Scottish shale, William Fraser sold these interests to <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> and joined the company soon after. Cadman worked with American and French interests to reconstitute French Turkish oil interests into <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>, which he chaired. While Alex Fraser left for America to work at <italic>Shell</italic>. Since his cousin Grenfell of <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> hired him, Vivian Smyth and his cousin Abel linked <italic>Shell</italic> Britain, <italic>Samuel,</italic> and <italic>Burma</italic> oil ventures. \nSince 1903, French oil refiners <italic>Desmarais</italic>, <italic>Deutsch-Meurthe</italic>, and <italic>Fenaille Despaux</italic> adapted by forming a cartel to protect their market share and stabilize oil prices. Despite these efforts, American dominance, particularly <italic>OIL</italic>, continued to grow, and by 1914, <italic>OIL</italic> was the exclusive supplier of refined products to France, leaving the country increasingly dependent on external suppliers and vulnerable in times of crisis. \nSo, after WWI, France extended import controls. As <italic>OIL</italic> embargoed her as punishment for the controls, France sought Iraq to secure oil resources. Having advocated for oil efficiency through WWI, <italic>Shell</italic> Britain\u2019s Robert Waley Cohen-Barent mediated between France and <italic>OIL</italic> As French companies renewed the oil cartel, a Franco-British agreement allocated the confiscated German share in <italic>Turkish Petroleum Co</italic> to France in 1919.\n <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and <italic>Shell</italic> established <italic>Oil Production Co</italic><italic> </italic>to manage the French stake, with a minority investment by <italic>Paribas</italic>. In 1920, <italic>Lazard</italic> head David Weill\u2019s daughter married Roger Seligmann\u2014who was a great nephew of the brother of <italic>Bischoffsheim </italic><italic>Goldschmidt</italic>-in-law and<italic> Paribas</italic> co-founder Henri Bamberger, cousin twice removed married a Rothschild, and second cousin of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Otto Kahn.\nLikewise, <italic>Shell</italic> partnered with refiner <italic>Deutsch-Meurthe</italic>\u2014led by Henri Goldschmidt, who married Marie Deutsch-Meurthe and changed his surname to \u201cGoldet\u201d\u2014to establish <italic>Jupiter</italic> refinery. Marie\u2019s cousin Georgette Deutsch-Meurthe married Gaston Gradis\u2014a son of Katz-descendant Suzanne Gunzburg Fould and Raoul Gradis, a Sephardi shipping heir of Bordeaux and cousin of the Goudchaux. The same year, Fould, Worms, and Rodrigues families\u2014, who became the head of various transport and trading businesses. \nFollowing his leadership of <italic>Paribas</italic> Amsterdam, Huguenot Mijnhardt Boissevain became General Delegate of <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>, the successor of <italic>Dutch East Indies Co</italic>. In the 1890s, <italic>Boissevain</italic> secured funding for <italic>Royal Dutch</italic>, which later merged with <italic>Rothschild </italic>Paris-funded <italic>Shell</italic>. After Boissevain died in 1917, his cousin-once-removed Jan Pierson took over the firm, which he renamed <italic>Pierson</italic>. \nLike the Boissevain had long dealt with <italic>Speyer</italic>, the Piersons had developed strong Jewish relations. Pierson\u2019s wife was a Mendes DaCosta, whose great aunt\u2019s husband was a Teixeira. Likewise, <italic>Pierson</italic> had also kinterlinked with Gentle margarine manufacturer <italic>Bergh</italic>, who had married a Jewish Boas-cousin Spanjaard, owners of the one of the largest Twente textile mills. When <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris transitioned from being the banker of <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> to being a shareholder in 1920, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam and <italic>Pierson</italic> replacing her as bankers. While <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> banked <italic>Shell</italic> generally, <italic>Parisienne </italic>was<italic> Shell</italic>\u2019s bank in France. \nSince building his interests in <italic>Parisienne</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Nationale</italic>, British <italic>Vickers</italic> representative Basil Zaharoff acquired and reorganized the Parisian bank <italic>Mayer</italic> into <italic>Seine</italic> in 1918, with investors including the Vickers shipping family, Gregor Isvolsky, the Chiot Mavrogordatos, and <italic>Thalmann</italic> Paris. In 1920, he reorganized the German <italic>Banque d\u2019Orient</italic> into <italic>Banque Commerciale de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e</italic> in Constantinople. A year later, in 1921, he helped establish <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Huiles de P\u00e9trole</italic>, securing British oil transport interests in France, with capital from his <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Navale de l\u2019Ouest</italic> and <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>. Zaharoff also bought more shares in <italic>Parisienne</italic>, seeking to merge it with his other interests. Along with supporting Greece in the <italic>Greco-Turkish War</italic> from 1919, he invested in German chemical producer BASF and rivaled <italic>Stinnes</italic>.\nDissatisfied with <italic>Parisienne</italic>\u2019s leadership, <italic>Paribas</italic> sought to increase her control over Middle Eastern oil. Having already invested in Romanian oil through <italic>Omnium</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic> took control of <italic>Star</italic> from <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> in 1920. In Poland, <italic>Paribas</italic> formed a syndicate in 1920 to acquire two of the country\u2019s four leading oil companies. Likewise, <italic>Paribas</italic> allied with <italic>OIL</italic> to counter British <italic>Anglo-Persian\u2019</italic>s influence in the Middle East. Buying French refinery <italic>Fenaille Despaux</italic>, <italic>OIL</italic> handled the industrial side, while <italic>Paribas</italic> focused on political and financial matters, securing oil concessions. <italic>Paribas</italic> sold off her Polish investments, supported <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s subsidiaries, and expanded operations in Romania and the Middle East to oust Zaharoff and <italic>Parisienne</italic>.\nBefore WWI, Russian oil supplied 20-40% of France's imports. At the time, Jean Gunzburg and other French bankers reorganized Pereire\u2019s <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> to acquire stakes in Russian oil and coal infrastructure. In 1919, the French government sought to increase Russian oil imports to reduce the influence of Anglo-Saxon trusts. After the Allies seized German-owned Romanian oil companies, <italic>Mobilier </italic>acquired German-owned <italic>Spies</italic> in Russia. Likewise, Hector Carlier, the son of a <italic>Belgian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>director and co-owner of SG <italic>Belge</italic>-affiliated <italic>Bank of Antwerp</italic>, formed <italic>Petrofina</italic> in 1920 with investment from SG <italic>Belge</italic>, which had organized <italic>Parisienne </italic>in 1904. With backing from <italic>Mobilier</italic>, <italic>Petrofina</italic> merged three of the seized Romanian companies into <italic>Concordia</italic> in 1921.\nMeanwhile, Russo-French banks\u2014such as <italic>Banque Russo-Asiatique</italic> formed by <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1910\u2014faced sought French support after Russia nationalized banks in 1917. While efforts to establish a French-chartered bank failed in 1920, the Russian famine of 1921 and <italic>Genoa Conference</italic> of 1922 rekindled interest in Franco-Russian trade as France extended tariff privileges for oil despite the Soviet default on debts. Although the government sought Franco-Belgian cooperation, private competition soon prevailed. \nAfter <italic>Marchal</italic>\u2014whose in-laws were tied to the P\u00e9rier and Boissevain families\u2014proposed a reorg of <italic>Russo-Asiatique</italic> in 1923, she partnered with <italic>Desmarais</italic> and <italic>Petrofina</italic> to secure a monopoly on Russian oil exports against OIL and <italic>Paribas</italic>. <italic>Marchal</italic> soon took control of the remaining assets of <italic>Russian Bank for Foreign Trade</italic>, although efforts with <italic>Russo-Asiatique</italic> failed again. And as <italic>Shell</italic> purchased Soviet oil, <italic>Petrofina</italic> bypassed traditional companies to import Soviet oil. Courts soon appointed <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019<italic> Chinoise </italic>as receiver for <italic>Banque Russo-Asiatique</italic>.\nIn the Middle East, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> led a syndicate with <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Lloyds</italic>, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>, and others to buy <italic>Orient Bank</italic>\u2019s shares to create a British-controlled <italic>ORIENT </italic>in April 1923. With violent French <italic>TURK</italic> investors, the French government pressured Turkey to block the transaction. With the failure of a <italic>Shell</italic> monopoly attempt, <italic>Parisienne</italic> became a major shareholder in <italic>Petrofina</italic>. In October 1923, the first draft of share distribution for the future French oil company was presented, with refiners, producers, and banks assigned 40, 37.5, and 22.5%. While <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>, <italic>Petrofina</italic>, and <italic>OIL</italic> held the lions share, the government admitted <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>\u2019s subsidiary due to changing geopolitical conditions.\nIn 1923, Sonia Gunzburg pushed her daughter Anna to marry David Weill\u2019s son Jean-Alexandre and Goldschmidt cousin Nelly Goldet married Pierre Mallet Vernes, whose father was a <italic>Parisienne</italic> co-founder and BDF Regent. Nelly\u2019s brother married Andr\u00e9 Lazard\u2019s Goldschmidt niece-in-law in 1924, as Anna Gunzburg divorced Jean-Alexandre Weill claiming violence. In 1924, Andr\u00e9 Goldet married Marie-Annette Goldschmidt Heilbronn, whose maternal aunt had been married to Andr\u00e9 Lazard and paternal aunt and uncle kinterlinked and managed <italic>Thalmann</italic> Paris. Marie-Annette\u2019s brother married Eliane Louis-Dreyfu\u00df in 1925, but soon divorced. The same year, a Pereire married the son of Marcel Champin, <italic>Mirabaud</italic>\u2019s oil representative.\nBy 1924, France chartered <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles</italic> as a public monopoly to manage France\u2019s share in the former <italic>Turkish Petroleum Co</italic> and import Iraqi oil. While <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>OIL</italic> balanced the interests with <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Shell</italic>, the share distribution remained undetermined, and rivalry continued. Ernest Mercier, who was President of <italic>Omnium </italic>from 1920 to 1921, left the role in 1922. In 1923, <italic>Paribas</italic> appointed him President of <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles</italic>. As part of the new cartel agreement in 1924, <italic>Petrofina</italic> gained a monopoly on Soviet oil imports to France, but due to competition with Romania for the Dardanelles, Anglo-American oil companies purchased more Soviet oil than allotted by the cartel. That year, Zaharoff married a Polish aristocrat, engaging in business his new in-laws.\nHowever, losses from the Greek campaign forced Zaharoff to sell <italic>Seine</italic> to <italic>Parisienne</italic> in 1925. Replacing <italic>Parisienne</italic><italic> </italic>after 1925, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris became <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s sole banker in France. Eduard Cahen-Fuzier\u2014whose father\u2019s first wife, Rodrigues, was a cousin-in-law of the Lazard and Henriques families\u2014was a director of <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Petrofina</italic>, through which he was connected to <italic>Shell</italic>. And since <italic>Schneider</italic> and <italic>Parisienne</italic> acquired <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Northern Countries</italic>, the bank hired a son of former <italic>Azov-Don Commercial Bank</italic> director Efim Epsteen, Michel, in 1925. Efim\u2019s other son joined <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris.\nAs rivalry persisted with <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Shell</italic>, on one side, and <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>OIL</italic>, on the other side, the French government intervened in 1928, implementing oil import quotas and supporting domestic refining, and taking a mediating stake in <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles</italic>. After <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris co-manager Alphonse Lazard\u2019s daughter married a <italic>Worms</italic> cousin and <italic>Shell</italic> founder Marcus Samuel\u2019s daughter Nellie\u2019s daughter married a Henriques\u2014an extended cousin-in-law of Pierson\u2019s Mendes wife\u2014in 1928, Nellie married a <italic>Parisienn</italic>e\u2019s Greek Zarifi cousin Ionides in 1930, while Nellie\u2019s brother was married to Rothschild cousin Montefiore since 1908. Also in 1930, Anna Gunzburg married another <italic>Lazard</italic> cousin.\n\n<italic>Panics of 1914 & 1920</italic>\nAfter the <italic>Civil War</italic>, coal from West Virginia to Illinois allowed for the expansion of the iron industry from the Midwest to the Great Lakes, which trans-continental railroads accelerated by the turn of the century. As <italic>Ely Walker</italic> grew into the Midwest\u2019s largest dry goods wholesaler, George Walker left to establish <italic>Walker</italic> in 1900, and swiftly ascended to prominence in Saint-Louis, acquiring <italic>Laclede Gas</italic>, <italic>New Orleans, Texas & Mexico</italic> RR, and other Texan railroads. \nAmidst Saint-Louis\u2019s thriving financial scene, Walker actively engaged in both business deals and Democratic politics, collaborating with former- Governor of Missouri David Francis and businessman Robert Brookings. He soon gained the business of <italic>Morgan </italic>and UPR\u2019s Harriman. (After Harriman died in 1909, Texan lawyer Robert Lovett\u2014and husband of a Southern extended cousin of the Morgans\u2014took charge of UPR.)\nAnd in Ohio, Frank Rockefeller, brother of <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s John, invested in the struggling <italic>Buckeye Steel Castings</italic> for railway car couplers in 1892. After Frank led<italic> Buckeye</italic>, he handed off leadership in 1907. The son of a <italic>Yale</italic> educated Episcopalian Reverend, Samuel Bush graduated <italic>Stevens Institute of Technology</italic> in 1884 with a mechanical engineering degree, and began apprenticing at <italic>PENN</italic>\u2019s affiliate in Indiana, <italic>Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago, & Saint-Louis</italic> RR. \nProgressing through the ranks, Bush joined <italic>PENN</italic> as the general superintendent of motive power for the line\u2019s southwest system in 1894. By 1899, Bush transitioned to <italic>Chicago, Milwaukee, & Saint-Paul</italic> RR before assuming the role of VP at <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s <italic>Buckeye Steel Castings</italic> in 1901. By 1908, Bush became the President of <italic>Buckeye</italic>, servicing rail systems controlled by <italic>Morgan</italic>, Harriman, and Rockefeller.\nDespite tarns-national trade and bankruptcy law, banking remained haphazardly state-regulated. In 1832, President Jackson abolished federal money tax by refusing to renew the central bank\u2019s banknote monopoly charter. Congress refused to charter monopolies for decades. As UST Secretary suggested the creation of regional central banks in 1900, President Roosevelt called for an elastic currency in 1901. Within months,<italic> Kuhn</italic> partner Jacob Schiff appealed to the <italic>Chamber of Commerce</italic> for stabilizing financial regulation. \nAs President Roosevelt\u2019s DOJ prepared to unleash anti-trust lawsuits against <italic>OIL</italic> in 1906, Schiff pleaded with Roosevelt for ICC to cartelize railroads as <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Paul Warburg advocated for an American central bank. From the 1870s, Massachusetts required competitive bidding in some conditions, whereby issuers sold their securities to the highest bidder, to prevent monopolization. However, AT&T abandoned this method from 1905 for <italic>Morgan</italic>. Against commissions since 1900, <italic>Kuhn</italic> lobbied ICC against compulsory bidding in favor of establishing more permanent investment banking relationships.\nLike <italic>Kuhn</italic>, kinterlinked German-speaking Jewish and Christian bankers linked international finance. In America, James Speyer, married a Protestant descendant of British aristocracy in 1897. Similarly, his brother Edgar, having become at least a nominal Anglican, married a German-American, in the English Church of Hamburg in 1902. Against the rising tide of Anglo-German rivalry, Ernest Cassel, Alfred Beit, Edgar Speyer, and Bruno Schr\u00f6der were among those to co-found <italic>Anglo-German Union Club</italic> in 1905. \nThe son of German Lutheran immigrant who became a chaplain to the Duchess of Kent, Henry Tiarks joined <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> in 1847 and married Agnes Morris, the adopted daughter of Alex Schl\u00fcsser, another partner and Schr\u00f6der cousin in 1862. In the same year, Henry Tiarks was promoted to office manager. Tiarks became a partner in the firm upon Schl\u00fcsser\u2019s retirement in 1871. \nTwo of Tiarks\u2019 daughters married two sons of <italic>Robarts</italic> <italic>Lubbock</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Nevile Lubbock. In 1894, after joining the navy, Henry\u2019s son Frank switched to banking following the death of his elder brother, who had been intended as partner for <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>. By 1902, he became a partner, working alongside his father, senior partner John Schr\u00f6der, and the senior partner\u2019s nephew, Bruno. While the German-born Bruno retained his Germanic identity throughout his life, Tiarks assimilated. \nUnlike <italic>Speyer</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Kleinwort </italic>financed German industrial firms and Anglo-German houses in Britain with acceptances. After Hinrich Kleinwort started trading in Hamburg, he married an \u00e9migr\u00e9 during of the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>. While their son, Alex, left to Cuba in 1838 to export to Europe, he and a Jewish coworker saw more profits in merchant banking, and moved to London to start <italic>Kleinwort</italic> in 1858. By 1897, <italic>Kleinwort</italic> became <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s correspondent, proving access to London\u2019s MMBU.<italic> </italic>\nAfter <italic>Goldman</italic> fused with <italic>Lehman</italic>, <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> parlayed their <italic>Kleinwort</italic> partnership to underwrite their first IPO for <italic>United Cigar Manufacturers </italic>in 1906. When Julius Rosenwald of <italic>Sears</italic> faced financial difficulties, and approached his cousin Henry Sachs for a loan, <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> underwrote the first retail chain IPO for <italic>Sears</italic> that year. By 1910, they led the IPO for <italic>May Department</italic> <italic>Store</italic>, founded by fellow Bavarian Jews. Within a decade, Marcus Goldman\u2019s grandchildren married an in-law of the Mays and a <italic>Macy</italic>\u2019s Straus heir.\nSince Lazarus Hallgarten\u2019s granddaughters married a descendant of Joseph Goldschmidt and Rothschild cousin-in-law Franchetti at the turn of the century, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Mortimer Schiff married a <italic>Hallgarten</italic> partner\u2019s daughter in 1901. After <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s Carl F\u00fcrstenberg became a silent partner at <italic>Hallgarten</italic> in 1903, <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s Hans Winterfeldt joined as an active partner. \nWhile  Winterfeldt resigned from <italic>Hallgarten</italic> to join <italic>Speyer</italic> New York in 1908, <italic>Hallgarten</italic> promoted F\u00fcrstenberg\u2019s son to partner and added Max Horwitz from <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>. The same year, a Lutheran <italic>Hallgarten</italic> heiress converted to Catholicism to marry a Spanish Marquis. Jewish assimilation took many forms. By 1910, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York scion Eugene Meyer married the daughter of North German Lutherans. Instead of converting, some Jewish brokers hired Gentles and vice versa.  \nPossibly related to the May family connected to Frankfurt, Fuld, Lazard, and Ladenburg cousins, Max May of Darmstadt trained at <italic>May</italic> Mannheim and other banks before immigrating to America in 1883 and became a citizen in 1888. Likely marrying a cousin of Henry Greenebaum, he worked at <italic>Union</italic> and <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>Chicago</italic> until joining <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> of New York in 1904, where he rose to VP and led FX. May\u2019s initiatives expanded daily transactions to $20 million and total turnovers to over $6 billion, primarily with Germany. \nIn 1897, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> recommended <italic>Teixeira</italic> cousin Max Teixeira to establish <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s FX department. By 1901, he became a foreign secretary at <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Pittsburgh</italic>, where he helped develop the bank\u2019s FX department. From 1903 to 1904, he led the letter of credit department at <italic>International Banking Corp</italic> in New York and traveled to Panama which led to a Panama branch. In 1904, he moved to New Orleans, and in 1905, he assumed leadership of the FX department at <italic>Interstate Banking & Trust Co</italic> for trade with Panama. And in London, as Katz-descendant Frederick Phillips retired from <italic>Phillips </italic>in 1908, aristocrat Jack Churchill Spencer became Partner alongside Katz-descendant Hermann Marx, Nunes DaCosta, and others.\nSome Jewish partners converted in name only. When Cassel married Annette Maxwell in 1878, he became a naturalized citizen and soon privately adopted his wife\u2019s Catholicism. While they had one daughter, Amalia, Annette died in 1881 and Cassel never remarried or seriously practiced Catholicism. Since his daughter married Wilfred Ashley\u2014whose second cousin was married to a Grenfell\u2014in the presence of Crown Prince Edward in 1901, Cassel saw the birth of his grandchildren but also suffered as Amalia lost her battle with tuberculosis in 1911. Initially resistant to the invitation to join the court of BOE, Tiarks ultimately acquiesced in 1912, despite the misgivings of John Schr\u00f6der, who believed it to be a waste of time.\nLike the banker cousinhoods, blood and marriages linked the European aristocracy. Since the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>, Queen Victoria of Britain began arranging marriages for her six children and later her thirty grandchildren to link the crowns of Britain, Germany, Spain, Russia, Denmark, Romania, Greece, and others. By the turn of the century, Europe\u2019s major powers were ruled by three related monarchs: George V of Britain, Wilhelm II of Germany, and Nicholas II of Russia. Wilhelm II, the grandson of Queen Victoria, was first cousins with George V, while Nicholas II, married to George\u2019s first cousin Alexandra, was also a relative through their shared ancestor, Tsar Paul I of Russia. Together, the marriages spurred comradery instead of war.\nCalling Roosevelt\u2019s paternalistic government-business cooperation in foreign policy \u2018Dollar Diplomacy\u2019, the Taft Administration elevated it into the cornerstone of its foreign policy. Liberia had a history of debt to English creditors, primarily British bankers. In 1906, Liberia took another loan from London, with strict conditions, such as British financial advisers overseeing customs revenue and allocating funds for roadbuilding and rubber development. These conditions resulted in conflicts and increased indebtedness.\nMeanwhile, Congress passed a convention with the Dominican Republic in 1907, under which an American, appointed by the State Department Secretary but paid by the Dominican Republic, established a receivership under Kuhn over the island\u2019s customs collections, the major source of government revenue. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, Liberia fought to suppress native uprisings while facing border disputes with Britain and France. Facing challenges servicing British loans, Liberia sought American assistance to prevent European colonization. \nThe success of the Japanese in the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic> strengthened China\u2019s hand in bargaining with Europe. Since King Leo of Belgium and Congo Free State most of Philippines-focused <italic>American China Development </italic>with loans from <italic>Morgan </italic>during the <italic>Spanish-American War</italic>, China became outrage by the sale in 1904. By 1905, <italic>Morgan </italic>sold his shares back to the Chinese government, leaving a substantial financial profit for Leo without control over <italic>Hankow-Canton</italic> RR or the Philippines. \nAs Roosevelt appointed former <italic>Stone Webster</italic> executive Cameron Forbes, a grandson of John Forbes and a son of AT&T\u2019s founding president, to the Philippines Commission, Forbes became head of Philippine public works, navigation, coast survey, corporations and railroads, as well as police and firemen until 1908, after which he was appointed Vice Governor and then Governor of the Philippines. \nWillard Straight represented <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and <italic>Harriman</italic> in the Far East. Born in Oswego, New York, Straight\u2019s mother moved to Japan after his father died. He graduated from <italic>Cornell</italic> in 1901 and joined the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs Service, where he served as personal secretary to a British diplomat in Peking. During the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic>, he worked as a <italic>Reuter</italic> war correspondent, and then with the State Department in Korea and Manchuria. Joining <italic>Morgan </italic>in 1909, he married William Whitney\u2019s daughter Dorothy Payne Whitney in 1911, and became a <italic>Morgan </italic>partner in 1913.\nNotwithstanding loss in the <italic>Russo-Japanese War</italic>, Russia encroached into Manchurian Harbin in 1908. To balance Japan\u2019s aggressive stances and defend China\u2019s sovereignty in Manchuria against Russia. Facing opposition from official action by Congress, the State Department allowed American investments not challenging Japan, recognized Japan\u2019s influence in South Manchuria, aimed for fair treaty interpretations, and protected China\u2019s integrity. However, the 1909 administration change shifted towards an \u2018open-door\u2019 concept, involving America more in Manchuria and strengthening the Anglo-Japanese alliance. During this time, Edward Harriman and <italic>Kuhn</italic> sought to purchase or assist China in acquiring <italic>Chinese Eastern</italic> RR and <italic>South Manchuria</italic> RR, contingent on Russia and Japan\u2019s concurrent cooperation. \nOn behalf of the State Department, a consortium of <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>First</italic> NB o<italic>f New York</italic>, and <italic>Citi</italic> (\u201c<italic>AMERICA</italic>\u201d) participated in <italic>Hukuang Loan</italic> and proposed <italic>Chinchow-Aigun</italic> RR in Manchuria. The consortium actively promoting American investments in China, prioritizing cooperation over competition when extending loans to the Chinese government under the leadership of Thomas Lamont. The native-born son of a Scotch-Irish Methodist minister, Lamont was educated at <italic>Philips Exeter Academy</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> as a Presbyterian. He was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Henry Davison, whom he followed from <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> to <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>, and finally <italic>Morgan</italic>. Like Davison in 1909, Lamont made <italic>Morgan </italic>Partner by 1911. \nEuropean banks also grew in Latin America. Since Bolivia\u2019s first mining railroad in the 1890s, Bolivia faced military defeats, losing the rubber-rich Acre territory to Brazil in 1903. A year later, Bolivia and Chile signed a peace treaty. Negotiated by miner Felix Aramayo, Bolivia renounced coastal territories in exchange for trade warranties, stimulating Bolivian tin mining., As the British <italic>Antofagasta & Bolivia</italic> RR and <italic>Speyer </italic>New York and <italic>Citi</italic> NB financed railway segments from 1906, <italic>La Paz-Guaqui</italic> RR connected Bolivia to Peru by 1908. And with the <italic>Railways Act of 1910</italic>, Bolivia aimed to connect ports, mining centers, and towns, to foster domestic trade and reinforce national unity.\nIn addition to geopolitics, cartels stabilized local economies. In 1905, Brazil nationalized <italic>Banco do</italic> <italic>Brasil</italic>, giving it a monopoly on note issuance, while <italic>Rothschild</italic> London retained her debt underwriting monopoly. As <italic>Banco</italic> failed to support coffee prices during the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, Bruno Schr\u00f6der devised the San Paulo coffee valorization scheme and became chairman of the committee responsible for the sale of the collateral coffee in 1908. While<italic> Rothschild</italic> lost her monopoly on Brazilian debt after six decades, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> sold sovereign debt for Bulgaria and Romania. \nIn late 1909, Germany became concerned about potential American involvement in Liberia, fearing it could harm German trade interests. Germany was Liberia\u2019s primary trading partner, with German merchants managing most imports and exports, while German ships dominated the country\u2019s shipping routes. Germany also had significant financial ties with Liberia. Following a call from President Taft and petition from Booker Washington, <italic>Tuskegee Institute</italic> Trustee Paul Warburg. To preempt possible American intervention, <italic>Kuhn</italic> approached the State Department<italic> </italic>with a loan proposal on behalf of its German sister bank. Inspired the cooperation in China, the Department enlisted <italic>AMERICA</italic> to represent the State Department with control over Liberian customs revenues to market bonds and granting America influence over Liberian affairs. \nAlso in 1909, President Roosevelt commissioned a team to assess, which recommended America become Liberia\u2019s advocate in boundary disputes, reorg its debt, and establish a customs receivership, like the Dominican model, for financial stability. Taft\u2019s administration, however, elevated \u2018dollar diplomacy\u2019 government-business cooperation into the cornerstone of its foreign policy.\nIn 1910, Haiti granted a contract to a coalition of French, German, and American citizens to establish <italic>Haitian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>(\u201cBNH\u201d). Chartered by <italic>Parissienne</italic>, BNH assumed responsibility for public debt flotation, tax collection, currency issuance, and civil service salary payment. Encouraged by the<italic> </italic>State Department to counterbalance French and German interests, <italic>AMERICA</italic> bought BNH shares. Under the 1910 loan deal, the lenders took control of the national railroad and BNH to implement gold-standard currency reform.\nFor Nicaragua, the bankers appointed the American customs collector from the<italic> </italic>State Department recommendations, rather than a formal convention. To secure loans from <italic>Brown</italic> and <italic>Seligman</italic> in 1911, Nicaragua\u2019s President authorized <italic>Brown</italic> to open <italic>Nicaraguan</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>under the laws of America to serve as the government\u2019s fiscal agent, current account depository, and monetary policy implementer as foreign-owned central bank. \nFor the loan for Liberia negotiated in 1912, the State Department similarly made the customs receivership a condition of the private loan contract to pay off British debt, but without going through Congress. Along with <italic>AMERICA</italic>, the participating banks included <italic>Warburg</italic>, <italic>Hope</italic>, and <italic>Paribas</italic>, like the other transactions. <italic>AMERICA</italic> also took part in refunding loan-receivership agreements for Honduras and Guatemala.\nMeanwhile, German-speaking Jews continued to draw antisemitic ire. Back at the turn of the century, the involvement of <italic>Beit</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and others South African Jewish trade financiers, antisemites oversimplified the conflict as a \u2018Jewish war.\u2019 Since Britain\u2019s Postmaster had nationalized telegraphy in 1869, private telephony within a decade. As competition grew, the Postmaster effectively monopolized telephony by 1912. \nAmidst the Anglo-German rivalry, the British Admiralty aimed to establish a wireless network for global communication with British vessels across the Empire. Negotiations commenced, leading Postmaster-General Herbert Samuel provisionally accepting <italic>Marconi</italic>\u2019s bid in March 1912. Samuel\u2019s cousin Gerald Montagu of <italic>Samuel Montagu</italic> allowed <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic> of Amsterdam to use his name to buy <italic>Marconi</italic> shares for an undisclosed client.\nPrior to the public announcement, <italic>Marconi</italic>\u2019s managing director, Godfrey Isaacs, also secured new shares in <italic>Marconi</italic> America. Isaacs was born in London to a family of fruit importers, and was a third cousin twice removed of David Salomons, the first Jewish mayor of London. His brother Rufus pursued law and was elected to Parliament for Reading in 1904 and became Attorney General in 1910, contributing to the <italic>Titanic</italic> inquiry. By 1911, he was appointed Privy Councilor. Godfrey sold some shares to Rufus without disclosure in 1912, who, in turn, offered a portion to <italic>Exchequer</italic> Chancellor David George. \nDuring the <italic>Marconi</italic> scandal, where rumors suggested that Godfrey had secured a government contract for <italic>Marconi </italic>through Rufus\u2019 influence, and that Rufus, along with the Chancellor, had profited from insider knowledge by speculating on shares. As most of the involved were Jewish, the scandal brought out antisemitic prejudices. In the parliamentary inquiry in 1913, Rufus admitted his involvement in the share dealings, though the inquiry found that he had acted in good faith. Though cleared of corruption, the report divided along party lines, with Liberals denying impropriety and Conservatives crying misconduct. While the controversy ended Rufus\u2019 political ambitions, he was appointed the first Jewish Chief Justice in 1913 and ennobled as Baron Reading in 1914. As the investigations resulted in the cancellation of the original contract, the wireless network remained incomplete when WWI started in 1914.\nIn America, competition fueled finance. Since leaving <italic>Harris </italic>at the turn of the century,<italic> </italic>Chicago-based <italic>Halsey</italic> <italic>Stuart</italic> financed some of Insull\u2019s rural PUs after the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>. By 1910, PUs became the main business of <italic>Halsey</italic> <italic>Stuart </italic>and <italic>Harris</italic>. By then, <italic>Halsey</italic> expanded to eleven American cities and two foreign branches. After Noah Halsey\u2019s death in 1911, the firm split into three incorporated parts: one in New York covering eastern and foreign branches, one in Chicago, covering the Midwest, and a third focusing on the Pacific Coast. \nSince building the Chicago branch, Harold Stuart formed <italic>Halsey Stuart</italic>. That same year, <italic>Harris</italic> New York became <italic>Harris Forbes</italic>. Becoming VP of <italic>Harris Forbes</italic> that year, John Macomber also made director of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> in 1912 before becoming President of <italic>Harris Forbes</italic> in 1916.<italic> </italic>Also in 1911, <italic>Russell</italic>-descended Allan Forbes became President of Boston\u2019s<italic> State Street Trust</italic>, which grew sixfold since 1899. <italic>State Street </italic>continued growing over Allan Forbes\u2019 tenure until his death in 1955.\nOnly in 1912, <italic>Kuhn</italic> promoted New York-born Jerome Hanauer as its first non-relative partner, whose wife was an extended cousin-in-law of a Katz-descendant <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter </italic>partner. Hanauer had joined the firm at 16 after attending the city university on a scholarship for a year. Amidst the banking churn, the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic> led Senator Nelson Aldrich\u2014an ally of <italic>Morgan </italic>and Rockefeller\u2019s in-law\u2014and <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Warburg to draft a plan for <italic>Federal Reserve System</italic> (\u201cFRS\u201d). Unlike centralized and state-controlled European central banks, private banks elected the semi-autonomous FRS District Banks to create an elastic currency suitable to the regional economic circumstances. The initial plan accepted only unsecured <italic>commercial paper</italic> (\u201cCP\u201d), UST, and municipal bond collateral with which banks could inflate the emergency currency. They then included railroads bonds allowed by state banking regulators, as these were federally regulated and provided liquidity. \nAlong with bankers, the crisis stimulated lawyers. Graduating from <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law by 1904, Waddill Catchings joined <italic>Sullivan</italic> and became involved in restructurings after the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>. His notable achievement came in overseeing the successful emergence of New York City\u2019s only steel mill, <italic>Milliken</italic>, from bankruptcy in 1909. Following this, in 1910, Catchings was appointed receiver for <italic>Central Foundry</italic>, where he facilitated its operations and eventually assumed the role of president. The following year, <italic>OIL</italic> and Howland cousin John Russell Auchincloss joined the future-<italic>Davis Polk</italic>\u2014whose Senior Partners were his maternal uncle and sister\u2019s father-in-law\u2014in 1911 and soon became a partner.\nAlmost two decades after Samuel Untermyer promoted <italic>Pillsbury</italic> to British investors, he guided the company into receivership in 1908. In 1910, as large New York law firms prevented large law firms such as <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer Marshal </italic>from publicly soliciting services,<italic> </italic>Julius Cohen lamented the commercialization of the legal profession. Worrying about the rise of large corporate-focused law firms, Cohen argued that lawyers in such firms risked losing sight of the broader perspective, suggesting that those inclined towards business might find greater success outside of law. The firm\u2019s Jewish banking ties did not help. \nHowever, President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s coalition rallied against a Wall Street-centered FRS. Since Samuel Untermyer began supporting New York City Democrats in the 1890s, he served as Special Counsel to Congressman Arense Pujo\u2019s hearings. Because <italic>Morgan </italic>remained in <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s <italic>Alton</italic> voting trust despite <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s financing, Untermyer concluded that there was a <italic>MONEY</italic> trust for new issues consisting of <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kidder</italic>, <italic>Lee</italic><italic> Higginson</italic>,<italic> Citi </italic>NB, and <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>. \nWhile the six banks cited \u2018reputation\u2019 in defense as the hearings forced bankers to form a trade association with over 200 members in 1912, Aldrich was too ill to present, and died in 1915. John Morgan died by early 1913. His estate was much smaller than those of Rockefeller or Carnegie. Unlike for <italic>Morgan</italic>, the hearings did not focus on <italic>Kuhn</italic> as prejudice limited Jewish participation on boards to times of crisis. Blaming Warburg and Untermyer for his father\u2019s death, John Morgan Jr grew antisemitic.\nWith the inaugural  (\u201cFA1913\u201d), Congress chartered FRS to reorient the money market from MMSEC to CP and\u2014unlike the Roosevelt-Taft position\u2014monopolized bank reserves and forbid FRS from discounting loans secured by private securities. Along with serving as <italic>Princeton</italic> President and Professor of Political Science and at <italic>Princeton</italic>, Wilson had been a on the board of <italic>Morgan</italic>-controlled <italic>Mutual</italic> LIC for several years before becoming Governor of New Jersey. \nAgainst the Taft and Roosevelt monopoly supervision debate, Wilson enacted stringent anti-trust laws in New Jersey and campaigned nationally to end big business and regulate competition. As DOJ<italic> </italic>brought a second suit against <italic>COALA</italic>, AT&T sold <italic>Western Union</italic> to <italic>Kuhn </italic>and agreed not to monopolize telephony in 1913. While <italic>Western Union</italic> tried to monetize telegraphic payments, FRS monopolized it. \nAppointed Secretary of UST by President Wilson in 1913, McAdoo was instrumental in establishing FRS. Georgia-born William McAdoo\u2019s family had strong Tennessee roots, and he clerked with the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals there in 1882. He was admitted to the bar in 1885 and practiced law in Chattanooga until 1892, after which he moved to New York and entered a law partnership. Allying with <italic>Morgan</italic>, he became President of <italic>Hudson & Manhattan</italic> RR in 1902, overseeing the completion of the tunnel. Wilson thought it imprudent to allow the widower McAdoo to resign when he married Wilson\u2019s daughter in 1914.  \nAlongside McAdoo, President Wilson appointments to FRS\u2019 board included Comptroller of the Currency John Williams and Assistant Secretary of UST Charles Hamlin. Williams was a Virginia banker who had worked closely with McAdoo on Morgan railroads, while Hamlin, a Boston attorney, was connected through marriage to a wealthy Albany family linked with the Morgan-dominated <italic>New York Central</italic> RR. Other directors were Paul Warburg, who was influential but not given a leadership role due to his pro-German views, and several <italic>Morgan </italic>and Rockefeller affiliates. One was an Alabama coal banker William Harding (unrelated to future President Warren Harding). \nFor Vice Chair, Wilson chose Frederic Delano. An uncle of Franklin Delano Roosevelt (\u201cFDR\u201d) and second cousin once removed of John Morgan, Delano had graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1885 and joined <italic>Chicago, Burlington & Quincy</italic> RR, becoming her General Manager in 1901. He later served as President of <italic>Wheeling & Lake Erie</italic> RR, <italic>Wabash-Pittsburgh Terminal</italic> RR, and <italic>Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville</italic> RR, which had connections to the Rockefellers. \n<italic>Citi</italic> NB\u2019s President Frank Vanderlip successfully lobbied for FA1913 to allow NBs to branch internationally. After starting a branch, Vanderlip bought a large interest America\u2019s first and largest international bank from 1901, <italic>International Banking Corp</italic>, with branches in London, Panama, and Singapore.<italic> </italic>Within days of FA1913, Congress unwound the Court\u2019s \u2018<italic>rule of reason</italic>\u2019 to AA1890 with the  (\u201cAA1914\u201d). For a <italic>per se</italic> illegality, AA1914 disregarded misconduct requirements and replaced BOC with <italic>Federal Trade </italic><italic>Commission</italic> (\u201cFTC\u201d). While tariff-era AA1890 continued barring monopoly, AA1914 expanded anti-trust to HCs and collusion by smaller cartels.\nWhile FA1913 prohibited FRS bank officers, directors, employees, or attorneys from accepting investment banking profits, AA1914 banned directors from interlocking boards of competing companies. As <italic>Morgan </italic>dissolved voting trusts controlling <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> and <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic>partners to resign from 30 directorships. As John Morgan stepped down from 18 directorships, including <italic>New York Central</italic> RR, <italic>New York, New Haven & Hartford</italic> RR, and W<italic>estern Union</italic>, Davison resigned from AT&T, <italic>Astor Trust</italic>, <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>, and <italic>Chemical</italic> NB, and Lamont resigned from <italic>Westinghouse</italic>, <italic>Utah Copper</italic>, <italic>Astor Trust</italic>, and <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>. \nAs John Morgan and Jacob Schiff resigned from the board of <italic>Citi</italic> NB, Paul Warburg resigned from NB<italic> of Commerce</italic> by 1914. More than inconvenient, these changes could be disruptive as <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic> lost six directors, including Charles Stone of <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>, John Macomber of <italic>Harris Forbes</italic>, Henry Hornblower of <italic>Hornblower Weeks</italic>, and James Storrow of <italic>Lee</italic><italic> Higginson</italic><italic> </italic>before FRS later eased restrictions. From 48, NB <italic>of Commerce</italic>\u2019s directors fell to 34. With<italic> </italic>just 9 directors, <italic>Chase</italic> NB lost all private banker representation.\nAA1914 led the investment sensitivity to cash flow for <italic>Morgan</italic>-affiliated firms to triple. However, Congress postponed AA1914\u2019s ban on bankers from serving on the boards of railroads for which they underwrote securities. Meanwhile, Wilson\u2019s anti-trust legislation from New Jersey resulted in tax revenue loss to Delaware, and so a new legislature repealed the laws by 1917. AA1914 required FRS approval for NB directorate interlocks and forbade inter-state HCs, except for regulated industries without direct competition: SBs outside of large cities and PUs. For these, most common law trusts had incorporated in New York and Delaware. \nUpon Taft\u2019s 1909 amendment, Wilson\u2019s  eliminated tariffs and taxed income. While Taft\u2019s TA1909 exempted HC dividends from double taxation, TA1911 included marginal dividend taxes. By yearend, <italic>Federal Commission on Industrial Relations</italic> announced a comprehensive investigation of major charitable organizations, including <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic>, <italic>Russell Sage Foundation</italic>, <italic>Hirsch Foundation</italic>, and Carnegie benevolences to determine if these organizations posed a threat to the nation\u2019s future.\nTo thwart NBs from abandoning UST-regulated bank charters to become SBs, FA1913 allowed NBs to lend on farm real estate collateral. While European central banks historically discounted CP signed as evidence of specific debts, the absence of a central bank and bankruptcy process favored medium-term, unsecured CP. Even with FRS, most CP was too long for discount eligibility. As agricultural processors continued issuing FRS-discountable CP, industrials raised FRS-non-discountable CP, longer-term bonds, and stocks. As FRS decreased seasonally and MMSEC volatility, the latter grew. \nUnable to interlock directorates, marriages continued. Since advising <italic>Morgan </italic>against aiding insolvent <italic>Knickerbocker</italic> during the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, Benjamin Strong came to lead <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> after his father-in-law Edmund Converse retired in early 1914. By May, John Morgan\u2019s grandson Junius Morgan II announced his engagement to Louise Converse, Reverend James Converse\u2019s granddaughter and Edmund Converse\u2019s niece. From October, Strong led FRS <italic>New York</italic>, which he interlocked with BOE and BDF to stabilize trade. While <italic>Morgan </italic>grew industrial and public utility investment, <italic>Kuhn </italic>continued advising <italic>PENN</italic> and <italic>Westinghouse</italic> without competitive bidding. \nIn August of 1914, George Roosevelt\u2014nephew of former President Theodore Roosevelt and son of the President of <italic>Roosevelt</italic> bank\u2014reinforced the New York and Boston banking connection with <italic>Kidder</italic> with his engagement to Julia Thayer Addison\u2014his cousin-in-law through the Puritan Bayard, Winthrop, and Fish families and the extended cousin through the Knickerbocker Schuyler and Schaack families.\nSince forming during the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic> with backing from <italic>COPPER</italic>, <italic>National Copper Bank</italic> merged with <italic>Metals</italic> NB in 1909. The following year, <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>\u2019s capital increased with a changed directorate as <italic>Morgan</italic> allies consolidated industrial banking. Thomas Lamont, who moved from <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> to VP of <italic>First</italic> NB, Gates McGarrah, whose <italic>Leather</italic> & <italic>Mechanics</italic> NB took over <italic>Metals</italic> NB, and Edgar Marston of <italic>Blair</italic> and <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, replaced James Speyer, Walter Oakman, and J.R. Maxwell. <italic>Guaranty </italic>absorbed <italic>Standard Trust</italic> in 1912. \nLikewise, <italic>Guaranty</italic> and <italic>Metals</italic> NB linked with Guggenheim. While William Potter\u2014a Christian whose father had led <italic>American Trust & Savings Bank</italic> of Chicago and wife was a Boston Brahmin cousin of <italic>Lee</italic> bankers\u2014joined <italic>Guggenheim</italic> at the turn of the century, he joined <italic>Guaranty </italic>as VP in 1912, latter returning to lead <italic>Guggenheim</italic> Chile before heading <italic>Guaranty</italic>. By 1916, Potter\u2019s sister-in-law married the President of <italic>Metals </italic>NB<italic> </italic>and <italic>Guaranty</italic>. Similarly, Daniel Guggenheim became a <italic>Guaranty</italic> director.\nLikewise, the Guggenheims linked with the Jewish cousinhood. Since Straus cousins kinterlinked with the Abraham and Lehman families at the turn of the century, Nathan Straus of <italic>Macy</italic> wed Therese Kuhn in 1907, his cousins married Daniel Guggenheim\u2019s daughter Gladys in 1914 and Helen Sachs by 1915. By then, Felix Warburg\u2019s daughter married the son-in-law of <italic>Abraham Straus</italic> founder Abraham in 1915. While many bankers started during this period, several stand out.\nAround then, <italic>Merrill Lynch</italic><italic> </italic>(\u201c<italic>Merrill</italic>\u201d) formed with a dream of mass marketing securities. Charles Merrill\u2014Cravath\u2019s second cousin once removed and extended cousin-in-law of the Clark, Morton, Rockefeller, and Saint-John families\u2014was born to a small-town Florida doctor, and studied at <italic>Amherst</italic> and <italic>Michigan</italic> before arriving in New York in 1907. Merrill started in the financial office of a textile group before joining George Burr\u2019s CP-house in 1909, and developing the bond department. Going independent in 1914, Merrill partnered with Edmund Lynch, a <italic>Johns Hopkins</italic> graduate who sold soda fountain equipment. \n<italic>Dillon Read </italic>(\u201c<italic>Dillon</italic>\u201d) formed soon after. After serving in Napoleon\u2019s ill-fated campaign to conquer Russia in 1812, Frenchman Michel Dillon survived the campaign and settled in Warsaw, where he married a local woman, and developed extensive landholdings. Dillon\u2019s daughter later wed Joshua Lapowski. (Connections with Polish Court Jews turned Russian war purveyors Leizer Dillon of Niasvi\u017e or Beinish Lapkovsky of Belarussian Vitebsk are likely but uncertain.) Their son, Samuel Lapowski, later moved to America in the 1860s, and began vending in Texas. With the oil discovery in the late 1890s, Lapowski sold the land to finance machine tools. After Samuel died, his son Clarence Anglicized Lapowski to Dillon and bought a NYSE seat, joined <italic>Vermilye</italic>\u2019s spin-off <italic>Read</italic> in 1913. As the senior Read died in 1916, Dillon bought into the partnership. \nBefore Read\u2019s death, <italic>Read</italic> hired James Forrestal in 1915, the son of an Irish Catholic immigrant, because he too was an editor of <italic>Princeton</italic>\u2019s newspaper. After the leadership change, <italic>Dillon </italic>hired several fellow converted high caste Jews. One of the first was Ferdinand Eberstadt, a second cousin of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Otto Kahn, Paris Rothschilds, and <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> industrial families. Like Kahn, he adopted Presbyterianism, studied at <italic>Princeton</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic> Law, and married an Episcopalian. Although Catholics were not generally welcome on Wall Street, some broke through. As Irish Catholic electric patentholder Thomas Murray joined <italic>Edison</italic>\u2019s board, his daughter married co-religionist immigrant bondsman James McDonnell, who founded broker <italic>McDonnell</italic> in 1917.\nIn Britain, to promote trade over inflation of commercial bank notes, only merchant banks brokering foreign trade bills payable in London (\u201cMMBU\u201d) led BOE. BOE continued chose governors based on seniority rather than popularity or competence. Descended from London calico bankers of the 18th century, Walter Cunliffe founded an unremarkable bank in 1880. As his brothers-in-law served at BOE, which helped him to become the Deputy Governor in 1911 and Governor in April 1913, due to seniority and rotation. Still, this system began to crack. Shortly after the passing of <italic>Robarts Lubbock</italic>\u2019s John Lubbock in 1913, <italic>Robarts Lubbock</italic> merged with <italic>Coutts</italic> in 1914, enabling <italic>Coutts</italic> to acquire a Clearing House seat and establish a City branch. \nWhile Austria paid back half her 1912 loan to <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Citi </italic>NB, <italic>Kidder</italic>, and <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>\u2019s funds in London collapsed on July 27, 1914, Germany preemptively closed her stock exchange closed on July 30 to prevent foreign sales. A day later, <italic>London Stock Exchange </italic>and most countries withdrew from the gold standard. The <italic>Panic of 1914</italic> hobbled Austro-German inter-national capital and Britian ordered banks to shut on August 3 to prevent a run. Following Britain\u2019s declaration of war on August 4, the British government seized domestic German banks. \nUnlike Britain and France, Germany depended on municipal tax and debt until WWI. With an underdeveloped money market, Germany established loan bureau to issue certificates for short-term credit, alongside rediscountable GRB and trade bills, which served as secure collateral for GRB notes. In late 1914, <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg led the development of war credit banks to provide credit for the armament industry with capital from <italic>Deutsche</italic> and other large banks. Despite their creation, these banks were marginal in their role, as established credit institutions met investment needs. Moreover, GRB expanded collateral from GRS and select city bonds to all domestic securities. Germany also supported majority-approved compositions and real estate moratoria.\nUnder similar circumstances, Austria\u2019s <italic>Imperial Postal Savings Office</italic> organized a consortium of major Viennese and provincial banks to raise funds. For this effort, Austria conferred honors on bank officials in August 1915, including Louis Rothschild of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna, Alex Spitzm\u00fcller and Paul Hammerschlag of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, Alfred Herzfeld of <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic>, Bernhard Popper of <italic>Wiener Bank</italic>, Markus Rotter of<italic> Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic>, Eugen Minkus and Alois Weishut of <italic>Union Bank</italic>, Eugen Brettauer of <italic>Mercur</italic>, and Maxime Krassny of <italic>Lower Austrian Discount Bank</italic>.\nRarely shuttering, NYSE did during the <italic>Panic of 1914 </italic>to limit gold exports. As collateral loans froze, bank clearinghouses and currency associations issued emergency loan certificates and currency and <italic>Morgan </italic>bailed out New York City. When NYSE reopened four months later, collateral loans resumed. With the <italic>pound</italic> collapsed against the <italic>dollar</italic>, NYSE securities replaced gold in war financing. \nIn 1915, Chicago broker <italic>Becker</italic> of\u2014extended cousin-in-laws of the Greenbaum, Thalmann, Seligman, and Hellman families\u2014arranged a $10 million loan to Germany through <italic>Ladenburg</italic> <italic>Thalmann</italic><italic> </italic>of New York. By 1916, Becker funded the management buyout of Pennsylvania\u2019s<italic> </italic><italic>Hammermill Paper</italic> from her German parent, <italic>Varziner Papierfabrik</italic>.  But, like the capital markets, mergers and collateral loans stunted as FRS <italic>New York</italic>\u2014led by <italic>Seligman</italic> partner Frederick Strauss\u2014oversaw securities brokerage and capital issue curtailment. \nLike BOE\u2019s Norman was connected to <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Brown Shipley</italic>, FRS <italic>New York</italic> Governor Benjamin Strong had links with <italic>Morgan</italic>. Through the 1920s, Norman collaborated with Strong without the other FRS District Bank Governors to stabilize the <italic>pound</italic> by inflating <italic>dollar</italic> credit and preventing gold outflows to Britain\u2019s empire. \nDuring the <italic>Panic of 1914</italic>, British <italic>Midland</italic> Bank overtook <italic>Rothschild</italic> London in deposits, <italic>Rothchild</italic> Paris turned over <italic>COPPER</italic> stock to Britain\u2019s <italic>Exchequer</italic>, which sold it on NYSE when it reopened. Prior to WWI, global central bank paper currency prices changed in relation to stable gold. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>London Gold Pool</italic>\u2014including <italic>Mocatta</italic> <italic>Goldsmid </italic>(as <italic>Rapha\u00ebl </italic>exited refining), Goldsmid in-laws <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu, Johnson</italic>, <italic>Sharp</italic>, and <italic>Pixley</italic>\u2014committed to buy all South Africa\u2019s gold at a stable <italic>pound</italic> value per ounce to fix prices, Britain abandoned the gold standard to finance WWI. While the <italic>London Gold Pool</italic> had brokered gold between gold-producing countries and central banks, the collapse of the international gold standard, unbacked paper money flooded domestic consumer markets in almost every country, and private ownership and exchange of gold was widely restricted or forbidden.\nIn Britain, demand for loans and MMBU discounts overwhelmed BOE, which increased rates to the highest level since the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>. The crisis particularly affected banks with large exposures to Germany, Austria, and Russia. As BOE declared a moratorium, the partners of <italic>Huth</italic> invited representatives from MMBU accepting houses, including <italic>Arbuthnot Latham</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Brandt</italic>, <italic>Brown Shipley</italic>, <italic>Cunliffe</italic>, <italic>Fr\u00fchling G\u00f6schen</italic>, <italic>Gibbs</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic>, <italic>Kleinwort</italic>, <italic>K\u00f6nig</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Ruffer</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Seligman</italic> London, to address their exposure to Germany and Austria on August 5, 1914. The houses formed the Accepting Houses Committee, which negotiated with BOE\u2019s Cunliffe and the government to secure support. BOE agreed to take up the accepted bills and provide advances, stabilizing the market and allowing the accepting houses to meet their liabilities.\nWithout German exposure, <italic>Chapin</italic> <italic>Grenfell</italic> collapsed in 1914 since speculating on Canadian securities while his father-in-law Earl Grey was Governor of Canada between 1904 and 1911. Likewise, London lost control of her diamond syndicate before reestablishing one by 1915. Soon after, Britain blacklisted <italic>Knauth Nachod Kuhne</italic> and dozens of other firms with American operations because of their German connections. Under pressure,<italic> </italic>German partners withdrew from <italic>Knauth</italic> by 1917. \nCut off from Paris and New York, BOE invited<italic> Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Kindersley to join her Court, and Quaker <italic>Lloyd</italic> Bank\u2019s added <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand to her board. Since BOE long had direct ties with merchant banks, not commercial banks, <italic>Lazard</italic> London linked BOE to <italic>Lloyd</italic> Bank with partners Kindersley on BOE\u2019s Court and Brand on <italic>Lloyds</italic> Bank\u2019s board. \nWhile Kindersley chaired <italic>War Savings Committee</italic> to rase financing and presided over the succeeding <italic>National Savings Committee</italic>, Brand went to Canada in 1915 to establish the Imperial Munitions Board, returned to London as its liaison and representative, and in 1917 became Deputy Chair of the British war mission in America. By 1916, Brand advocated merchant banking and consolidation by arguing that British businesses without charters were generally small and family owned, unlike the American and German trusts and corporations developed. Within a year, Brand married Phyllis Langhorne of Virginia, whose sister Nancy had married the son of the newly ennobled Viscount Astor. By 1919, Nancy Astor became the first woman to serve in Parliament, continuing to do so until 1945.\nUnder Britain\u2019s <italic>Trading with the Enemy Act of 1916</italic>, accusations of espionage against Eduard Heydt\u2014a descendant of a <italic>Deutsche</italic> co-founder and cousin of the Engels, Styn, and Kamp families\u2014forced the dissolution of <italic>Heydt</italic>, but Samuel Japhet defended his loyalty by analogizing it to fidelity in marriage. While <italic>Kleinwort</italic> partners were all British-born, and two sons-in-law were on active service with the Royal Navy, they were married to Germans and effectively placed under house arrest and forced to pull their children from school due to harassment. German staff faced internment as unnaturalized aliens for the duration of the war, and the partners had to apply for licenses to retain essential staff. WWI also impacted merchant banks on the battlefield. \nIn 1917, the eldest son of <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Kindersley was killed in action, paving the way for his second son, Hugh, to join the firm after the war. Likewise, <italic>Hambro</italic>\u2019s Bertram and Percival Hambro died in 1915 and 1918. While Arthur Grenfell survived, he lost his twin brothers Francis and Riversdale. Since Captain Ashley Arbuthnot of <italic>Arbuthnot Latham</italic>, died of wounds received in action, <italic>Smyth</italic> cousin Reginald Smyth joined as a partner and drove <italic>Arbuthnot Latham</italic> to become the second merchant bank to adopt limited liability in 1921, the first being <italic>Baring</italic> in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Huth</italic> heir Richard Meinertzhagen served for Army intelligence in the Ottoman Empire, Sybil Smyth Hambro managed female staff and ran the secretarial sections within British Secret Service. The head of British Secret Service was Mansfield Smyth. A descendant of Abel Smyth, he was born in India in 1859 to John Smyth, who directed <italic>Delhi & London Bank</italic> and <italic>Madras</italic> RR and sat on the India Office\u2019s military fund committee. In 1898, he was posted to Victory for special service at Southampton, overseeing defense and intelligence work. In 1909, he became head of the Secret Service Bureau\u2019s foreign section, later MI-6. He recruited agents, deployed operatives in Europe, and gathered intelligence on German movements.\nMI-6 soon retained Baronet William Wiseman. Wiseman inherited a baronetcy in 1893 and banked in Mexico with <italic>Herndon.</italic> After joining the military at the start of WWI, he was wounded in a German gas attack in 1915. Following his recovery, MI-6 invited him to America. Wiseman established MI-6\u2019s main operations in New York, where he monitored German espionage, prevented sabotage, and infiltrated Irish and Indian nationalist secessionist movements and Russian revolutionaries, having Leon Trotsky arrested in Canada in 1917. \nIn 1916, he developed a relationship with Colonel Edward House, which facilitated communication between the State Department and British officials. While House\u2019s father had worked closely with <italic>Citi</italic> founder Charles Stillman in Texas, House\u2019s son-in-law, <italic>OIL</italic> heir and Rockefeller cousin-in-law Gordon Auchincloss, introduced Wiseman to President Woodrow Wilson.\nBy then, BOE Governor Cunliffe circulated forged German banknotes. As the war prolonged his term, he continued to serve until 1918, remaining a director until his death in 1920. Expanding through mergers and acquisitions, British banks forming the Big Five London clearing banks of <italic>Barclay</italic>, <italic>Lloyd</italic>,<italic> Midland</italic>, <italic>National Provincial</italic>, and <italic>Westminster.</italic><italic> </italic>While <italic>Midland </italic>acquired <italic>London Joint Stock Bank</italic>, adding a <italic>Rodocanachi </italic>as a director<italic>,</italic><italic> National Provincial</italic> bought <italic>Union Bank of London-</italic><italic>Smyth</italic>.\nBack in 1916, a government committee reported that German banks had provided superior credit facilities for trade. The British government formed <italic>British Trade Corp</italic> and <italic>Export Credits Guarantee </italic><italic>Dep</italic><italic>ar</italic><italic>t</italic><italic>ment</italic><italic> </italic>(\u201cECGD\u201d), spurred by <italic>Lloyd</italic> Insurer, allowing commercial banks to focus on domestic lending without German investment banks. While Germany had a less generous system, France had none. \nIn 1917, the Government asked <italic>Westminster</italic> to open in Spain to challenge German commercial power. In 1918, <italic>Lloyd</italic> acquired shares in <italic>National Bank of Scotland</italic> and exchanged shares with <italic>London & River Plate Bank</italic>. That year, the government lifted restrictions on bank amalgamations but required <italic>Exchequer</italic> approval for future mergers, generally allowing large banks to acquire smaller ones while blocking mergers between the Big Five. \nSo, <italic>Lloyd</italic> merged with <italic>Capital & Counties Bank</italic>\u2014which participated in a bank in France as well as in agencies for banks in Canada, Mauritius, and Brazil\u2014and <italic>Fox Fowler</italic> in 1921, ending private note issuance in England. <italic>Westminster</italic> branched to Bordeaux and Madrid in 1917, Barcelona in 1918, and Bilbao, Antwerp, Brussels, Lyon, Marseilles, and Nantes in 1919. <italic>Barclay</italic> also opened branches in Cologne and Algiers in 1919, Nice, Menton, and Cannes in 1920, and Monte Carlo in 1921. By 1924, the British Embassy pressed <italic>Barclay</italic> to establish a bank in Italy.\nSince George Booth\u2014whose <italic>Booth Shipper </italic>held a strong position in South American\u2014married a daughter of merchant banker <italic>Huth</italic>\u2019s Meinertzhagen in 1906, he became a director of BOE in 1915, and after 1918 he guided <italic>Booth</italic> through postwar restructuring with backing from <italic>Glyn</italic> and <italic>Fleming</italic>. George\u2019s cousin Charles became a director of <italic>Midland</italic> RR in 1898, serving as  Chair from 1919 to 1922. \nCharles also served as Chair of <italic>Booth Shipper </italic>from 1912, <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> from 1916 until British <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Shipley</italic> separated from American <italic>Brown</italic> by 1918, leading <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Shipley</italic>-affiliated <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> to acquire London bank <italic>Martin</italic>. Soon after, Richard Potter Holt, of the family that co-founded <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> and a cousin of the Meinertzhagens, became Chair of the combined bank. The Martins were cousins of the Farquhar, Brand, and Cavendish families, as well as the Normans, who partnered at <italic>Martin</italic>. The Normans kinterlinked with the Collets, affiliated with <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Shipley</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Gibbs</italic> cousin Brien Cokayne succeed Cunliffe as Governor of BOE from 1918, Montagu Collet Norman followed from 1920 until 1944. Montagu\u2019s grandfather George Norman had a family history in London commerce dating back to the 18th century when they imported Norwegian timber. He joined BOE in 1821 and remained until 1872. George\u2019s son, Frederick, married Russia trader Mark Collet\u2019s daughter. After Shipley retired in 1850, Collet led <italic>Brown Shipley</italic> from Liverpool, before serving as a BOE director from 1866 until his death in 1905. While one of Frederick\u2019s sons married a Drummond cousin of the Cavendish family connected to <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Brand, his son Montagu led BOE.\nIn 1921, <italic>Cunliffe</italic> merged with <italic>Fr\u00fchling G\u00f6schen </italic>into <italic>G\u00f6schen Cunliffe</italic>. Despite branching to New York in 1917, pre-moratorium commitments from 1914 forced <italic>Huth</italic> to borrow \u00a33.3 million from BOE by 1921. With the death of BOE Director Frederick Huth Jackson\u2014whose Liverpool shipping magnate brother-in-law was also a Director of the Court of BOE\u2014died that year, Governor Montagu Norman involved <italic>Deloitte</italic> for investigation, revealing doubtful debts from both pre-moratorium and post-war business, Norman proposed merging <italic>Huth</italic> with <italic>K\u00f6nig</italic>, with the K\u00f6nigs providing new capital and BOE advancing \u00a31.5 million. The restructuring plan included divesting businesses in Manchester and Valparaiso, ceasing London merchanting operations, and closing the New York office. While the K\u00f6nig had kinterlinked with <italic>American Hard Rubber Co</italic>, New York-born K\u00f6nig brothers moved to London to start <italic>K\u00f6nig</italic>.\nLikewise, the Schr\u00f6der family faced abuse and threats for having supported German charities, BOE director Frank Tiarks kept <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> from seizure\u2014as he secured access to BOE\u2019s emergency advances and assisted BOE in dealing with German banks\u2014and the Home Secretary naturalized Bruno Schr\u00f6der during the moratorium. As German-born stockbrokers were no longer allowed to practice, <italic>Phillips</italic> dissolved, while Smyth cousins <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic> picked up other clients. And public furor led<italic> Speyer</italic> London\u2019s Edgar Speyer to resign his positions and titles. With Cassel ostracized, Britain\u2019s Court Jew system collapsed. As anti-German sentiment grew, King George V rebranded the British royal family\u2019s name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor in 1917. \nSimilarly, <italic>Kuhn</italic> and other German Jewish firms faced severe uncertainty, torn between American patriotism and ties to Germany. Jacob Schiff publicly expressed his allegiance to Germany in a <italic>New York Times</italic> interview on November 3, 1914, saying \u201c<italic>For many reasons my personal sympathies are with Germany</italic>,\u201d adding that he could not turn against \u201cthe country of my birth\u201d during its \u201cstruggle for existence.\u201d In a letter to the <italic>Times</italic>, Schiff argued that neither Germany nor Kaiser Wilhelm II instigated the conflict. Likewise, he expressed confidence in Germany\u2019s success, writing in 1914 to a colleague, \u201cI have no fear that German civilization, German culture, and German manhood cannot be downed.\u201d\nMoreover, <italic>Kleinwort</italic>\u2019s American correspondent <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> promoted long-term New Englander Christian William Bowers of Massachusetts to manage <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> Chicago in 1915 as Katz-in-law Paul Goldman Sachs retired to join academia. After Frank, Charles Altschul\u2019s anti-German son joined <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in 1908, Charles\u2019 daughter Edith married Herbert Lehman in 1910. By 1913, Frank married Herbert\u2019s niece, Helen Lehman Goodhart, taking over <italic>Lazard</italic> New York when Charles retired in 1916. \nWhile <italic>International Continental Gas Association</italic> (\u201cICGA\u201d)\u2014founded by Moses Montefiore in the 1820s along with insurer<italic> Alliance</italic>\u2014employed neutral Dutch steamers to export coal to through the middle of 1916, Germany began mandating registration and soon appropriating ICGA\u2019s Hanover and Berlin PUs in 1917 and destroying other infrastructure after. Europe and France particularly needed American oil as<italic> </italic>Turkey and Iran joined <italic>Deutsche</italic> and other German banks to seize <italic>Anglo-Persian </italic>during WWI. \nSoon after incorporating in 1909, <italic>Anglo-Persian </italic>retained Charles Greenway as Managing Director. Taunton-born Greenway had joined a Calcutta-based trading firm in London in 1876 and moved to India in 1885 to work for <italic>Ralli</italic>. From 1893, he marketed <italic>Burmah Oil\u2019</italic>s kerosene in India, expanding <italic>Burmah</italic>\u2019s market share through a price war that led to a 1905 agreement with <italic>Shell</italic>. In 1908, after oil was discovered in Persia under the 1901 D\u2019Arcy concession, Greenway launched a new company in London. \nIn 1912, after <italic>Burmah</italic> blocked further funding, Greenway turned to the British government and signed two agreements with Winston Churchill-Spencer in 1914. The Treasury acquired a 51% stake in <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>, and the Admiralty signed a long-term fuel oil contract. Greenway became Chair and retained the managing directorship until 1919. During the war, Greenway created a tanker subsidiary in 1915 and oversaw a tenfold rise in Persian oil output despite sabotage of the pipeline. In 1917, he acquired <italic>British Petroleum</italic>, the expropriated British arm of <italic>Deutsche</italic>-backed <italic>European Petroleum Union</italic>. That year he also started building a refinery in Wales. He received a baronetcy in 1919.\nBy 1917, Frank Tiarks rejoined the Navy and became <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>\u2019s board. In 1921, Greenway hired John Cadman as technical adviser. English-born Cadman began his career inspecting collieries and then shale. In 1904, the <italic>Colonial Office</italic> appointed Cadman to develop Trinidadian asphalt. While Cadman returned to teach in Britain, Churchill-Spencer drafted him to investigate Persian oil prospects in 1913. He subsequently chaired <italic>Allied Petroleum Council</italic>. \nLikewise, <italic>Inter-Allied Petroleum Council</italic> distributing oil to the Allies under the responsibility of Alex Fraser, who had started his career at <italic>Pumpherston</italic> <italic>Oil </italic>before moving to direct Trinidad\u2019s asphalt industry. Unrelated to Alex, <italic>Pumpherston</italic>\u2019s William Fraser, Sr pioneered Scottish shale drilling, which played a significant role in the development of the British oil industry. Fraser\u2019s eldest son, William Jr, took over the company after his father\u2019s death in 1915, consolidating <italic>Pumpherston</italic> with other Scottish shale companies to compete with crude, and chairing <italic>Inter-Allied Petroleum</italic>. \nBefore WWI, Cognac-born Jean Monnet sold brandy across America and Europe as a teenager. By 1911, he established a relationship with <italic>Hudson Bay</italic>, which provided a loan to France in 1914. As <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Kindersley effectively headed <italic>Hudson </italic>from 1915, he was impressed as Monnet capped commissions during negotiations. But as America blocked foreign control after WWI, Pearson could not prospect on his Texan land. So, <italic>Dillon</italic> bought the oil lands. <italic>Pearson</italic>\u2019s funds helped <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Kindersley to branch to Antwerp, Brussels, Madrid, and Montreal. Focusing on acceptances, Kindersley\u2019s son, Hugh, worked in Paris, New York, and Madrid, and with correspondents in Toronto and Berlin.)\nAs in Britain, the French Court Jew system faced a reckoning. Although naturalized since 1884, awarded the <italic>L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur</italic> in 1908, and the father of a son fighting against the Germans, Emile Oulman was forced to resign from <italic>Comptoir</italic> after 1915. By August 1915, converted director at <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Franco-Serbian Bank</italic> Octave Homberg, Huguenot Regent of BDF Ernest Mallet, and <italic>Franco-Suisse Bank</italic>\u2019 Koechlin-in-law Albert Rossier served as delegates alongside British representatives in New York with <italic>Brown</italic> and other banks. As they sought to secure French and British credit balances in America to stabilize exchange rates, NB\u2019s unfamiliarity with foreign acceptances slowed negotiations. A descendant of Thellusson, Fran\u00e7ois Wendel became a Regent of BDF in 1913 and President of <italic>Comit\u00e9 des Forges</italic> iron cartel from 1918.\nAs MOF suspended the <italic>Paris Stock Exchange</italic> (\u201cPSX\u201d) from the <italic>Panic of 1914 </italic>through the war, she issued short-term debt, which BDF accepted as collateral (\u201cMMMOF\u201d). Like Britain, France used corporate securities to borrow funds overseas. Since America lacked chartered companies like <italic>Hudson Bay</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic> NB and other banks formed <italic>American International Corp</italic> (\u201cAIC\u201d) to issue $50 million of debentures and buy foreign securities from Allied nationals in 1915. \nLike EIC and <italic>Hudson Bay</italic>, AIC\u2019s broad scope allowed her to buy most securities. While <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Chase</italic> NB, GE, <italic>COPPER</italic>, UPR, <italic>Armour</italic> meatpackers, and others bought AIC stock\u2014with directors including <italic>HARVESTER</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Cyprus McCormick and <italic>Citi</italic> directors Robert Lovett, Jonathan Armour, and Stillman-in-law Percy Rockefeller\u2014<italic>Morgan </italic>saw AIC as encroachment into their business and refused to participate.\nWhile later joining AIC, <italic>Morgan </italic>formed <italic>American Foreign Securities Corp </italic>(\u201cAFS\u201d). As the French government designated <italic>Morgan </italic>as her official banking representative in 1914, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Henry Davison negotiating with <italic>Parisienne</italic>\u2019s Octave Homberg Jr on behalf of France, AFS issued $100 million of debentures against French-owned securities, with proceeds going to the French government in a $500 million Anglo-French loan. Likewise, <italic>Morgan </italic>entered into \u00a3100 million loan agreement with Britain in 1915. \nDespite their aversion to Jews, <italic>Morgan </italic>worked with Rufus Isaacs, who advised PM David George. (Baron Reading since 1914, Isaacs was made Viscount in 1916, elevated to Earl in 1918, and appointed high commissioner to America in 1917.) Also in 1915, Willard Straight, a husband Dorothy Payne Whitney, resigned his <italic>Morgan</italic> partnership to become VP of AIC.\nUnder Partner Edward Stettinius, <italic>Morgan </italic>established <italic>Export </italic>department. Although isolationist Midwestern states and German-speaking towns did not support Britain and France, Waddill Catchings and <italic>Walker</italic>\u2019s George Walker of Saint-Louis advised <italic>Export </italic>department on large scale exports via <italic>Morgan </italic>that exceeded America\u2019s federal budget by 400%. In 1915, <italic>Remington Arms</italic> Chair Marcellus Dodge, his father-in-law William Rockefeller, and others used a government rifle contract to form <italic>Midvale Steel & Ordnance Co</italic>, which they floated at a $24M profit. As <italic>Remington</italic>\u2019s rifle business boomed through WWI, she also expanded her typewriter business. After introducing her first cash register in 1918 and America\u2019s first electric typewriter soon after.\nIn Europe, Morgan relied on partners such as <italic>Bonbright</italic>. Philadelphia-born William Bonbright had founded <italic>Bonbright</italic> in New York, with London operations by the 1890s. He spent part of his career abroad, and his firm conducted international business. His partners included Anthony Drexel\u2019s grandson John Drexel and Guy Montagu Finch-Hatton, son of the Earl of Winchilsea. Finch-Hatton had married Drexel\u2019s sister in 1911, a year after Drexel\u2019s cousin married Jay Gould\u2019s granddaughter and over a decade since Finch-Hatton\u2019s cousin married a Paget in 1897.\nLikewise, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>, <italic>Brown,</italic> and others set up banks to finance Latin-American trade from 1915. As America stationed troops to protect the strategic <italic>Panama Canal</italic>, Panama resisted financial American pressure to appoint a fiscal agent. During the years of American neutrality, Charge d\u2019Affaires Joseph Grew represented America in Vienna and Berlin. Since John Morgan Jr married Jane Grew in 1890 and his cousin Jun Morgan wed Josephine Adams Perry, a Boston Brahmin descendant of Commodore Perry\u2019s brother, married in 1891, Jane\u2019s cousin Joseph married Josephine\u2019s second cousin once removed Alice Perry in 1905.\nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1914</italic>, states and UST cracked down on usury. While New York capped interest at 6%, she exempted demand collateral loans. Similarly, FRS\u2019 CP discounts were not usurious per common law.  As states began allowing higher rates on small loans to promote regulated credit over loan sharks, New York continued voiding corporate usury. After Congress chartered the <italic>Federal Farm Loan Board System </italic>(\u201cFFLB\u201d) to finance agricultural sales to Europe, she instituted excess-profit taxes with . \nBy penalizing small and indebted businesses, TA1916 stimulated stock issuance and mergers. But by using stock market prices, the tax was unpredictable until UST refocused on book values. Given FA1913\u2019s limitations, Congress enacted <italic> </italic>and TA1916 to shift the money market from MMSEC into UST bond collateral loans, MMUST. FA1916 enticed SB conversions by allowing NBs outside New York, Chicago, and Saint-Louis to make real estate loans. While FRS could not discount real estate loans, she accepted agricultural pledges and discount warehouse receipts. \nWhile <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Export </italic>department coordinated exports before America entered WWI in April 1917, Wilson appointed Bernard Baruch <italic>Commissioner for Raw Materials</italic>. Hiring Eugene Meyer to price copper, Baruch\u2019s hires for <italic>War Industries Board</italic> also included Herbert Lehman. As America joined the war, <italic>War Industries Board</italic>\u2019s<italic> Allied Purchasing Commission </italic>nationalized British purchases from <italic>Morgan</italic>. As <italic>War Industries Board</italic> grew to 500 people, Bernard Baruch chaired <italic>Allied Purchasing Commission</italic>\u2019s Board alongside fellow<italic> </italic>Wilson appointees Robert Brookings as lead of the <italic>Price-Fixing Committee</italic> and UPR\u2019s Robert Lovett as Priorities Commissioner. \n<italic>Walker</italic>\u2019s George Walker continued to thrive as a former associate of the latter two along with David Francis, whom Wilson had appointed ambassador to Russia in 1916. While Clarence Dillon assisted Chair Baruch, Samuel Bush oversaw Armaments and then Facilities Division to speed up national industrial activity. <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Henry Davison served as Chair of <italic>American Red Cross</italic>. <italic>Central Trust</italic> of Illinois\u2019 Charles Dawes headed the <italic>Railway Engineers</italic> division, overseeing the transport of American supplies into France. \nSince President Wilson appointed Alabama banker William Harding to the Board of FRS in 1914 and Governor in 1916, Harding stabilized the cotton market amid the British cotton embargo intended to block supplies from reaching Germany. Harding advised Britain to buy cotton in Liverpool and New Orleans to maintain price stability. In 1917,  his daughter married the son of <italic>Armour</italic>\u2019s Chair, connecting him to <italic>American International Corp</italic>. From 1918, Harding was also General Manager of <italic>War Finance Corp</italic> (\u201cWFC\u201d). Appointed Head of WFC, Eugene Meyer convinced Congress to make WFC bonds tax-exempt, and resumed financing Europe via <italic>Lazard</italic> London and Paris. \nAt the same time, <italic>Salomon </italic>grew into the leading UST bond broker. While the Salomon brothers\u2019 father may have been an Alsatian cousin of <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, their mother was an extended cousin-in-law of Anglo-Dutch industrialists. One of the brothers married a Tennessee merchant cousin of <italic>New York Times</italic>\u2019 Ochs family and the firm\u2019s founding partner was Morton Sonneborn Hutzler, of the Baltimore industrial family. FRS provided liquidity by discounting CP for agriculture and\u2014by directing UST collateral market-making instead of banks\u2019 private securities business\u2014financed UST debt. After limiting collateral loans, NYSE did the same for short sales. While <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s New York-born Hanauer assisted UST in connection with <italic>Liberty Bonds</italic> and worked with Meyer\u2019s WFC to raise financing.\nSince <italic>Morgan</italic>-allied large New York law firms banned law firms such as <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer Marshal</italic> from publicly soliciting services in 1910, Samuel Untermyer served as Special Counsel during the Pujo hearings against <italic>MONEY</italic> allegations. As WWI started, the Wilson Administration depended on <italic>Citi</italic> NB and other bankers to supervise financial aspects by promoting bonds to the American middle class. They advertised in newspapers educating people about bonds and assured small investors of sound advice, popularizing bonds. Despite <italic>Liberty Bonds</italic> having surtaxes above municipal bonds, big advertising campaigns led the less affluent to begin investing and deepen the markets in unparalleled ways. \nDuring the <italic>Panic of 1914</italic> in America, New York banking regulators closed small Jewish private banks which did not have enough reserves amidst runs. When America entered WWI in 1917, several small Jewish private banks collapsed in Chicago. With the <italic>Espionage Act of 1917</italic> criminalizing anti-war activities, James Phelps Stokes resigned from the Socialist Party to focus on other political and philanthropic efforts. His Jewish Cinderella wife, Rose Pastor, since marching for safety standards following the <italic>Triangle Shirtwaist</italic>\u2019s tragedy and helping striking <italic>Belmont</italic> <italic>Hotel</italic> workers, however, was later arrested and briefly sentenced to prison. After they divorced several years after, Stokes married to Lettice Lee Sands and continued to serve as President of <italic>Nevada Central </italic>RR, while Pastor played a leadership role in what became the American Communist party.\nAfter decades of nativist attempts, Congress limited immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe by passing of the <italic>Literacy Act of 1917</italic> despite a veto from President Wilson. And as two German partners resigned from <italic>Speyer</italic> New York, James Speyer resigned from <italic>Speyer</italic> Frankfurt. With Europe\u2019s Court Jew system destabilized, <italic>Kuhn</italic> and American Bavarian Jewish bankers financed Cassel for Britain and France via Amsterdam and bought UST debt when UST called for purchases. \nAlthough <italic>Kuhn</italic> was supposed to lead Europe financing in 1917, <italic>Morgan </italic>took over negotiations with Cassel on European loans as <italic>Kuhn</italic> refused to be complicit in oppression of Russian Jews. While <italic>Kuhn\u2019s</italic> reputation was damaged, <italic>Goldman</italic> was eager to participate in the loan. However, as Pro-German Henry Goldman refused to join, threat of blacklist by BOE led him to resign, leaving with <italic>Goldman Lehman </italic>without Goldmans. Instead of using his cousins at<italic> Goldman</italic>, <italic>Sears</italic>\u2019 Julius Rosenwald tapped Chicago broker <italic>Becker</italic>\u2014his in-law through the Sulzbergers\u2014for bond financing in 1919. Unlike <italic>Kuhn</italic>, Franco-Jewish <italic>Lazard</italic> and Eugene Meyer were decidedly more pro-Allies than pro-Germany.\nSince <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Export </italic>department folded, Waddill Catchings assumed the presidency of <italic>Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron</italic> of Birmingham, Alabama, to supply the war.  Other regional bankers, industrialists, and politicians also joined New York banks. With his family leading <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic> and other banks since 1900, Robert Forgan joined <italic>Citi</italic> in 1917. \nTennessee bankers were particularly active. <italic>Caldwell</italic> spearheaded the expansion of banks from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ohio River, with branches in key cities. As Howard Sheperd joined <italic>Citi</italic>, Eugene Black joined <italic>Harris Forbes</italic> in 1918. While <italic>Chemical</italic> NB recruited Southern-born Nathaniel Baxter Jackson and Harold Helm, both from <italic>Vanderbilt </italic>and <italic>Princeton</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic>hired Longstreet Hinton in 1923. After Henry Goldman resigned,<italic> Goldman Lehman</italic> replaced him with Catchings.\nFollowing the <italic>Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917</italic>, <italic>Office of Alien Property Custodian</italic> began assuming control and disposing of enemy-owned property. In 1918, the Custodian took control of <italic>Hungarian-American Bank</italic>, dissolving her in 1919. \nLikewise, naturalized immigrants gained control of German industrials. During forced German asset sales, <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen </italic>America\u2019s Ludwig Vogelstein and <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> America\u2019s manager Carl Loeb\u2014not closely related to <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Loeb but an in-law of Alabama\u2019s Moses family\u2014took over and reorganized the metal refiner into <italic>American Metal</italic> (\u201c<italic>AMAX</italic>\u201d), adding UST Secretary Andrew Mellon during the Harding Administration. Another executive was Robert Mayer, a Seligman cousin who had arrived from London. Under pressure from Mellon, <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> and the French cartel sold <italic>Southern Aluminum </italic>to <italic>ALUM</italic>. \nSimilarly, Charles Engelhard gained <italic>PLATINUM</italic>\u2019s assets, soon becoming <italic>NICKEL</italic>\u2019s exclusive American agent. Other non-German American bankers also prospered. Since his brother curtailed securities with FRS <italic>New York</italic>, <italic>Seligman</italic> partner Albert Strauss advised the government on international financial transactions and represented UST on the <italic>War Trade Board</italic> from 1917. \nFrom 1917, America directed GE\u2019s PUHC (\u201cSGE\u201d) to seize German PUs in Cuba and elsewhere in the Americas and withdraw patents. However, GGE had sold most of her PUs as neutral countries to Belgian-based PUIHC <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re de Transports & d\u2019Entreprises Industrielles </italic>(\u201cBGGE\u201d). \nPrior to WWI, GGE\u2019s Belgian exchange-traded PU <italic>investment HC</italic> (\u201cPUIHC\u201d) led by American-born Dannie Heineman, had interests in forty-four companies across thirteen countries by 1913. While Germain Cassel\u2019s son Leon was a cousin of Halphen, Speyer, and Bischoffsheim,<italic> Credit Anversois</italic> President Josse Allard had led Ottoman infrastructure projects. \nHe acquired the former <italic>English Electricity Co</italic> in Salonica in 1906. Collaborating with Baron L\u00e9on Steenhault, Allard founded the tramways in Izmir in 1909. Belgian investments surged in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 for Tramways & Electricity in Beirut by 1914. Allard also formed the <italic>Consortium de Constantinople</italic> in 1911, where BGGE, led by Victor Fris and Dannie Heineman, played a central role. However, WWI halted their progress.\nBritain also consolidated PUs. Leaving the London-Branch of American engineer <italic>JG White </italic>in 1907, George Balfour and Andrew Beatty formed <italic>Balfour Beatty</italic> to develop Scottish streetcars. A Scot by ancestry of unknwon relation to PM Balfour, he joined Parliament from 1918, pushing Britain to privatize and consolidate PUs. By 1922, Balfour stared <italic>Power</italic> PUIHC to develop Scottish hydroelectricity. <italic>Power</italic> soon became Britain\u2019s largest PUHC. Affiliating with GE\u2019s <italic>International</italic> GE (\u201cIGE\u201d), Balfour expanded across Britain\u2019s colonial empire from 1924 with director interlocks. As <italic>Power</italic> acted as manager and shareholder to the PUs, <italic>Balfour Beatty</italic> contracted power station construction, and IGE supplied the equipment.\n<italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s market share shrank with Texas anti-trust. As common law allowed only above-ground oil ownership, each owner had unlimited rights for the under-ground oil, and deflated prices by over-drilling. Drillers burned natural gas to limit oil production, but Texas prohibited the waste in 1899. As IA1906 granted ICC pipe jurisdiction and ordered RHCs to divest coal and oil, oil discoveries and drillers deflated prices and <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s market share. <italic>OIL </italic>interests stopped losing market share after the Court dissolved <italic>OIL</italic> in 1911. \nA pioneer in trading OIL shares after the dissolution in 1911, Carl Pforzheimer underwrote many oil companies when Wall Street had little interest in the industry. Moreover, <italic>OIL</italic> interests faced competition from <italic>Shell</italic> and independents. As independents turned to mass solicitation for capital raising, Republican state \u2018<italic>blue sky</italic>\u2019 laws capped valuations and required even brokers to register securities. While voters and courts eased most of these restrictions, the Court upheld broad registers in 1917. \nSince ICC allowed <italic>OIL</italic> interests to retain pipes, transport shifted to pipes. Coal roads also lost share to oil-fed automobiles and trucks. While RHCs sold off coal and <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Midwest coal pool died as DOJ opposed bituminous consolidation, Kentucky\u2019s Harlan coal drew land bids by <italic>ALUM</italic>, <italic>COALB</italic>, L&N, <italic>Ford</italic> <italic>Motor</italic>, <italic>SOUTH</italic>, and <italic>STEEL</italic> from 1910, before building rails. But Harlan soon institutionalized brutality. As these corporations vertically integrated with coal, Samuel Insull\u2019s PUs followed after WWI. By 1917, Rockefeller gained control of <italic>COALB </italic>from <italic>PENN</italic> and Baltimore banks. <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul replaced <italic>COALB</italic>\u2019s one non-reelected retiring director.\nWhile courts protected <italic>COALA</italic> and other coal RHCs from DOJ under Roosevelt, the Court prohibited volume pricing in 1912. With IA1906\u2019s rate caps and continuing risks of forced divestment, railroads stopped investing in coal transportation. With growing exports to Europe, railroads hoarded coal that PUs had contracted. Insull lobbied Wilson to stabilize coal prices until America entered WWI, when Congress fixed prices with the , created the <italic>Food Administration</italic>, arbitrated strikes, and a high . While DOJ permitted coal cartels, FTC and Congress allowed small coal refineries to increase rates. \nAs Wilson acquired power over Cuban sugar, growing strikes led, Assistant Navy Secretary Franklin Delano Roosevelt (\u201cFDR\u201d)\u2014a nephew of William Forbes, brother-in-law of the Astors, third cousin of John Morgan, and a fifth cousin of Theodore Roosevelt, FDR grew closer to the latter by marrying his niece Eleanor, a descendant of the Schuyler and Livingston clan, in 1905\u2014to create <italic>National War Labor Board</italic>. By year end, President Wilson nationalized the transportation sector. But after ICC had refused flat prices increases, Congress expanded Wilson\u2019s rate-setting authority in early 1918. \nSince Wilson appointed FDR\u2019s uncle Frederic Delano as Vice Chair of FRS, the latter resigned in 1918 to join the Army and was later named deputy director of transportation in Paris. While Delano\u2019s daughter married his extended cousin James Peabody Houghteling in 1917, Katharine Delano Price\u2014Delano\u2019s niece and FDR\u2019s cousin\u2014married a grandson of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>\u2019s George Baker.\nPresident Wilson continued to rely on bankers. When the government took over railroads and merged <italic>Adams Express</italic>, <italic>American Express</italic>, and <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> into <italic>American Railway Express</italic>, splitting ownership equally, <italic>Adams</italic> moved financing from <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> to <italic>Chase</italic>, which invited the largest shareholder,<italic> Hayden Stone</italic>, to the Board. Likewise, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s New York-born Hanauer worked with Meyer\u2019s WFC to devise financing for railroad equipment purchases.\nBefore becoming a labor lawyer in 1907, second generation Russian immigrant Julius Cohen had advocated for New York City\u2019s free public transportation transfers in 1902. Amidst WWI in 1917, Cohen innovated the British public benefit corporations for tax benefits as counsel to <italic>New York & New Jersey Harbor Development Commission</italic> and the succeeding, <italic>Port Authority of New York & New Jersey</italic>. America\u2019s first <italic>authority</italic> innovated for multipurpose, inter-jurisdictional public construction. This <italic>Authority </italic>remained unique for many years.\nBy then, President Wilson appointed Herbert Hoover\u2014a Quaker with Russian mining interests\u2014to direct America\u2019s <italic>Food Administration</italic>. Hoover was soon joined by Lewis Strauss-Darmstadt. Born in West Virginia to a first-generation American shoe merchant in 1896, Strauss-Darmstadt grew up in Richmond. Instead of college, he had saved $20,000. As Russian famine spread in 1918, Wilson suggested that Hoover consult Court Justice Brandeis for information on the country, not knowing that Hoover had interests there. \n<italic>Food Administration</italic> retained Prentiss Gray to lead<italic> </italic>the Marine Division. From a California lumber family, Gray descended from Emperor Charlemagne and of Reverend Thomas Hooker\u2019s sister as well as an extended cousin of the Thayer and Blair families. After founding a grain export firm, he became President of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York in 1923.<italic> </italic><italic>Food Administration</italic> also hired Nathalie Schenck to conserve food. Born in New York to an in-law of Erastus Corning\u2019s descendant, Schenck divorced her first husband and the father of her children. After marrying again, she found herself widowed by 1913.\nSince Congress nationalized the communications industry in August, FRS reduced UST debt cost by ordering NYSE to hike margins and banks to decrease MMSEC. However, hostilities ended in November. Congress limited price controls to \u2018<italic>necessities,</italic>\u2019 and FRS released the capital markets. As commerce increased TA1916 tax liabilities, taxpayers fueled public spending and farm real estate as they ran to tax-exempt debt. By late 1918, Congress enacted FA1918, allowing NBs to merge without liquidation, but continued requiring loss realization for mergers with non-NBs. To stimulate the economy,  incentivized capital gains, allowed corporations to carry over tax losses, and deferred shareholder reorg taxes, including mergers and spit-ups.\nIn early 1914, deflationary gold-standard currency reform implementation conflicts in Haiti led to fighting. Although the State Department proposed a receivership, Haiti, France, and Germany opposed it. With the start of WWI, the French reduced their interests in <italic>Haitian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>(\u201cBNH\u201d), which <italic>Citi</italic> gradually bought. In July 1915, Haiti\u2019s Black President Vilbrun Sam ordered the execution of 167 political prisoners, sparking a mulatto-led revolt. Faced with riots, Sam fled to the French embassy, where rebels captured and killed him. President Wilson, concerned about German influence, occupied Haiti to safeguard American interests. \nIn 1918, America imposed a constitution on Haiti and enforced compulsory labor laws. <italic>Citi</italic> consolidated Haitian foreign debt under American control and assumed responsibility for collecting customs revenues, like the Dominican receivership of 1905. Likewise, <italic>Haitian American Sugar Co</italic> acquired German sugar estates and <italic>United Fruit Co</italic> bought German banana plantations. Although occupation aimed to restore stability, build infrastructure, and combat disease, Haiti\u2019s Black population resented the military.\nLikewise, Liberia\u2019s receivership deteriorated during WWI. By 1914, twenty German firms operated in Monrovia, with <italic>German </italic><italic>Liberia Bank </italic>as the country\u2019s only bank other than <italic>Bank of British West Africa</italic>. Since <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s refused the State Department\u2019s request to extend aid from 1914, Liberia operated on credit from <italic>Bank of British West Africa</italic> from 1916 as the British navy halted Liberian commerce by cutting off German trade. \nIn 1917, Liberia declared war on Germany and confiscated German firms and <italic>German </italic><italic>Liberia Bank</italic>. With customs revenues collapsed, the government borrowed from <italic>Bank of British West Africa</italic>, which sought to provoke Liberia\u2019s financial collapse to enable a British takeover until 1918, when America provided Liberia with credit, insisting on tight supervision, thus cementing American control over Liberia\u2019s finances. \nAnd as British firms expanded in East Africa, <italic>Sassoon</italic> invested in Zanzibar and then mainland until reorganizing into London-domiciled <italic>African Mercantile </italic>in 1915. Since America stationed troops to protect the strategic <italic>Panama Canal</italic>, Panama resisted financial American pressure to appoint a fiscal agent but eventually agreed in 1918 in exchange for American assistance in securing private loans. This arrangement gave America control over expenditures and favored American companies in project contracts. Additionally, an American supervisor was appointed for the Panamanian police, and American troops briefly took control of key areas in Panama to quell political unrest.\nAs <italic>Morgan </italic>expanded to promote reconstruction, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> branched to India by fused with the Scottish <italic>Yule Catto</italic> banker by 1917, soon headed by Vivian Smyth. By 1918, John Morgan cousin-in-law Joseph Grew was chosen as Secretary of the American delegation at the pre-Armistice negotiations and remained in Paris as Secretary-General of the American Commission to Negotiate Peace. With connections to <italic>Fiat</italic>\u2019s Giovanni Agnelli, Giovanni Fummi participated in the Paris Peace talks in 1919, from where <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> hired him to expand in Italy from 1920. As Fummi led Italian companies and managed Vatican investments, he developed business ties with Italian leader Mussolini, which <italic>Morgan </italic>supported due to stability and anti-Marxism. \nAlso in 1920, <italic>Morgan </italic>hired Thomas Gates. Born to the President of <italic>Mutual</italic> LIC of Germantown, Pennsylvania, Gates graduated <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> to work for a prominent lawyer and rise to President of <italic>Philadelphia Trust Co</italic> by 1912. A third cousin once removed of John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife, William Huntington Perkins\u2014not a relative of Thomas-Handasyd Perkins\u2014led <italic>Bank of America</italic> since 1890 and merged with <italic>Franklin Trust Co</italic> in 1920 and later absorbed <italic>Atlantic</italic> NB around 12 months prior to his retirement in 1921.\nIn 1921, <italic>Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust</italic> of New York elected James Perkins as President. A second great-nephew of Boston Brahmin Thomas-Handasyd Perkins and third cousin once removed of Joseph Grew, he graduated <italic>Harvard</italic>, and became VP of Boston\u2019s <italic>American</italic> <italic>Trust Co</italic>. After marrying a second cousin once removed of <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic>\u2019s Thomas Coolidge in 1908, he joined Albany\u2019s <italic>National Commercial Bank</italic>, serving as her President from 1912 until joining <italic>Citi</italic> NB as VP in 1914. During WWI, he served as a colonel, led <italic>American Red Cross</italic> in Europe in 1918, and was Assistant Chief of Staff of <italic>American Expeditionary Forces </italic>in France and Germany. Benjamin McKee, grandson of President Harrison, represented <italic>Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust</italic> in Paris after working at <italic>Byllesby</italic>. His father was a GE VP, and his sister married an <italic>Anheuser Busch</italic> heir.\nIn France by then, a brother of the founder of <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic>, Richard Thalmann established <italic>Thalmann</italic> Paris and married Emma Heilbronn in 1894. While Thalmann managed <italic>Thalmann</italic> Paris with Emma\u2019s brother, Emma\u2019s other brother co-founded <italic>Heilbronn Herrmann</italic> bank with Gustave Herrmann and married Herrmann\u2019s cousin Claire Goldschmidt, whose sister Lucie married Andr\u00e9 Lazard. During WWI, Thalmann\u2019s nephews married Christians during WWI. In 1914, Walter Rosentower of <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic> married Lucie Bigelow Dodge, a granddaughter of America\u2019s former Ambassador to France John Bigelow and a second great granddaughter of Anson Phelps. Having joined <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> in 1908, Walter\u2019s brother Felix married Oliver Harriman\u2019s granddaughter, Mary Harriman, in 1916. \nMeanwhile, Mary\u2019s second cousin, Averell Harriman, son of UPR\u2019s Harriman, graduated <italic>Yale</italic> in 1913, married Kitty Lanier Lawrence\u2014an heiress of<italic> Lanier Winslow</italic> and Astor in-law\u2014in 1915, and gained a directorship in <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> as he formed <italic>Merchant Shipbuilding Corp</italic> in 1917, soon American\u2019s largest merchant fleet. Taking over the pre-war routes of seized <italic>Hamburg-American Shipper</italic>, he formed <italic>United American Shipper</italic> and operated routes from New York to Hamburg, Cape Town, and Vladivostok, under the leadership of Harris Livermore. Livermore had married a third cousin once removed of Henry Stimson, John Morgan\u2019s former lawyer.\nAverell formed the investment house of <italic>Harriman</italic> in 1919 and, with his brother, a private bank a year later. He promoted George Walker to President of <italic>Harriman</italic> in 1920. The same year, Walker\u2019s daughter Dorothy wed Samuel Bush\u2019s son Prescott. By 1922, <italic>Harriman</italic> hired <italic>JG White</italic> engineer Joseph Ripley. And a year after British <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Shipley</italic> separated from American <italic>Brown</italic> in 1918, a daughter of the latter\u2019s senior partner married the son of UPR\u2019s Robert Lovett, who joined the bank.\nWhen <italic>Paribas</italic> and other French bankers left Mexico during WWI, they appointed Basque descendant Agustin Legorreta Ramirez to head<italic> Banamex</italic>. He helped revive the bank, aligning it with Mexican government financial needs, working closely with <italic>Banco Central Mexicano</italic><italic> </italic>and American officials. When WWI ended, America sought to exert control over Mexico and curb her socialist revolutionary activities. Certain Americans, including oil companies, advocated military intervention to establish financial supervision over Mexico, while others proposed pressuring Mexico\u2019s leader, Carranza, into accepting a loan and financial reorg overseen by American bankers. \nPresident Wilson chose the latter option, authorizing the State Department to collaborate with <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Lamont and <italic>Rothschild</italic> to create an American-led international banking consortium. They would offer Mexico a loan in exchange for overseeing customs revenue and property guarantees for foreign businesses. They made similar attempts in China, which did not go as planned. In Mexico, economic improvements and a new government reduced the need for supervision, and in China, nationalist sentiments and conflicts with Japan complicated securing loans. Likewise, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC incorporated <italic>Merton</italic>\u2014the former British subsidiary of <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic><italic>\u2014</italic>into <italic>British Metal</italic> <italic>Corp</italic> led by a Smyth cousin, to safeguard non-ferrous metals within the British Empire, as a Smyth-in-law was the war-time Governor of South Africa.\nPost-WWI foreign control laws led <italic>Lazard</italic> London to dissolve the international partnership, incorporate, and raise funding from Weetman Pearson. As Pearson sold his Mexican oil assets to <italic>Shell </italic>and <italic>Parisienne</italic>,<italic> </italic><italic>Lazard</italic> London reorged his Mexican PUs and German PU assets and electrical engineers, including <italic>Siemens</italic> Britain and Cassel\u2019s <italic>Vickers</italic>, and Chilean PUs. In 1918, <italic>Midland Bank</italic>-director Dudley Docker arranged the joint purchase of <italic>Westinghouse</italic> Britain by <italic>Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Finance Co</italic> and <italic>Vickers</italic>. \nIn 1919, <italic>Metropolitan</italic> fused into <italic>Vickers</italic>. In 1921, Docker registered <italic>Electric </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Railway Finance Corp</italic> (\u201c<italic>Elrafin</italic>\u201d) with directors including Docker\u2019s son, BGGE\u2019s Dannie Heineman, and Edward Pearson, whose brother ran <italic>Lazard</italic> London. <italic>Elrafin</italic> operated as a private financial house linking British and continental capital. That same year, <italic>English Electric</italic> acquired <italic>Siemens</italic> Britain, and <italic>Vickers</italic> took over <italic>Westinghouse</italic> Britain. Despite suffering newspaper attacks as a public trustee took over German BGE shares, Hirst remained in control of BGE with continued funding from <italic>Midland Bank</italic><italic> </italic>to buy <italic>Osram</italic> electric lamp operations from <italic>Siemens</italic> and GGE. Hirst also sold shares to Docker. \nLike in Britain, shipping cartels convinced the Court of their value in 1912. Since American interests dominated global resources, <italic>COPPER</italic> lobbied to limit exports, and FTC sought to stabilize coal. So, Congress exempted shipping cartels in 1916 and supra-national trade cartels in 1918 from AA1914, which Commerce Secretary Hoover promoted. Anticipated <italic>STEEL </italic>dissolution and war-depleted oil inflation, investors ran to steel and oil start-ups. \nHowever, the Court rejected DOJ in dissolving <italic>STEEL</italic>, limiting FTC\u2019s power and sanctioning informal industry cooperation for price stability. While <italic>OIL</italic> interests\u2019 pipe share grew, ruinous competition deflated oil prices and decreased <italic>STEEL</italic>\u2019s production share. By limiting inter-state HCs, AA1914 spurred mergers. When <italic>Lackawanna Steel</italic> merged into <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic> in 1922, the Chair of the former Moses Taylor\u2014a grandson of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Civil War era leader Moses Taylor\u2014became a director of the latter and saw his daughter marry Astor-in-law Robert Huntington, whose sister was married to the head of the American Astor family.\nBefore Russia monopolizing alcohol in 1894 and banning it in 1916, the Bronfman family (whose name means \u2018distiller\u2019 in Yiddish) fled antisemitic pogroms in Moldova to settle in Canada in 1889. Despite initial wealth, patriarch Yechiel Bronfman faced adversity when tobacco farming proved incompatible with the Canadian climate. Worked as a railroad laborer, Yechiel bought a shed and traded firewood and frozen whitefish. Evolving into the hotel and bar business, Yechiel\u2019s sons, entered the whiskey trade during Canada\u2019s Prohibition in 1916. \nBy rebranding their operations under medicinal liquor sales during wartime prohibition, the Bronfmans maximized bootlegging profits, with Sam acquiring a liquor store in Montreal in 1916, strategically positioned for travelers heading to the \u2018dry\u2019 west. In America, without <italic>WHISKY</italic>\u2019s restraint of alcohol overproduction, Congress enacted Prohibition to ban alcohol, inflating prices and fostering organized crime. After WWI and the Spanish flu epidemic constrained supply chains, growing inflation and TA1918, stock ownership grew faster than it would the 1920s. As investors purchased shares, bankers needed collateral loans to market these securities. \nAs Britain suspended peace-time gold convertibility in September 1919, the <italic>London Gold Pool</italic> formalized to fix South African gold prices. Since wartime control limited wage increases, inflation squeezed laborers globally. As a result, 1919 and 1920 set the record for the largest walkouts in American history. Over four million steel, coal, and other employees went on strike. The scale of the disruption left Wilson with no choice but to increase wages and tighten UST in April 1920, but by then, coal prices soared as underinvested supplies depleted. Industrial British <italic>Midland</italic> replaced French <italic>Lyonnais</italic> as the largest bank in the world under Reginald McKenna, Britain\u2019s wartime First Lord of the Admiralty.\nSince America entered WWI, <italic>Morgan </italic>and the Morgan family endured several violent attacks. In 1917, authorities arrested two German men for planning to bomb the Morgan offices. On April 18, 1920, Thomas Simpkin, a former asylum patient, killed James Markoe, a Morgan family friend, during church services; a second bullet narrowly missed John Morgan\u2019s son-in-law, Herbert Satterlee. Then, on September 16, 1920, a bomb hidden in a wagon exploded outside <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Wall Street office, killing 38 people, including employee William Joyce, and injuring over 300, including Jack Morgan\u2019s son, Junius. The attackers were never found, prompting Jack Morgan to increase his security and dismiss staff of German and Austrian descent from his estate.\nSince FA1913 prohibited bankers from accepting investment banking profits, private bankers used affiliates. America\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Citi</italic> and her affiliate functioned as one of the largest securities and trust firms. After years of trying to gain a controlling interest in <italic>International Banking Corp</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic> NB\u2019s President Frank Vanderlip completed the acquisition in 1918, but resigned from related frustrations. James Stillman, the son of Vanderlip\u2019s predecessor, became President briefly until Charles Mitchell succeeded him in 1921. While banks formerly focused on corporations, Mitchell pivoted to a full-service bank including individuals. Introducing interest-bearing savings accounts with accounts as low as a dollar in 1921, <italic>Citi</italic> expanded, starting with <italic>Commercial Exchange Bank </italic>and <italic>Second</italic> NB .\nBy 1921, Hoover became America\u2019s Secretary of Commerce. While Court Justice Brandeis hoped Lewis Strauss-Darmstadt would join <italic>League of Nations </italic>after WWI, Mortimer Schiff and Oscar Strauss convinced Strauss-Darmstadt to join <italic>Kuhn </italic>as partner in 1919 and marry <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Hanauer\u2019s daughter by 1923. Likewise, Nathalie Schenck began managing the women\u2019s department of <italic>US Mortgage & Trust </italic>and other banks from 1919 before her untimely death, her sister, Josephine, married Mortimer Schiff\u2019s son many years later.\nAfter several <italic>Morgan </italic>partners resigned, they flourished in other fields. Since settling the coal strikes of 1902, <italic>Lee</italic><italic> Higginson</italic><italic>-</italic>cousin Robert Bacon resigned from <italic>Morgan </italic>and served in high federal posts during his friend Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Administration, including Secretary of State, and then Ambassador to France, and Overseer of <italic>Harvard</italic>. Not closely connected to Boston Brahmins, George Perkins grew from <italic>New York</italic> LIC\u2019s Chicago branch clerk to board director while his father traded between New York and Chicago. After joining <italic>Morgan</italic>, Perkins refused to give up his <italic>New York </italic>LIC board seat and retained a female secretary against <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s practice of excluding women. The rouge Perkins left <italic>Morgan </italic>by 1910. While one of Perkin\u2019s sons joined <italic>Hallgarten</italic>, another kinterlinked the American subsidiary of German pharmaceutical <italic>Merck</italic>\u2014which went public in 1919\u2014and became COO.\nUnrelated with William Whitney, <italic>Morgan </italic>partner Edward Whitney\u2019s brother presided over a Boston bank and built an India trade fortune. A bachelor, Edward\u2019s nephews, George and Richard, followed parallel paths. As George joined <italic>Morgan </italic>by 1907 and married Robert Bacon\u2019s daughter, Richard joined<italic> Kidder</italic> before he moved to New York and formed <italic>Whitney </italic>1910. During WWI, George grew at <italic>Morgan </italic>while Richard worked for Hoover in DC. By 1916, Richard married the daughter of <italic>Morgan </italic>client George Sheldon and widow of the son of <italic>Prime</italic> cousin Samuel Sands and Anne Harriman Vanderbilt. As George Whitney made <italic>Morgan </italic>partner in 1919, Richard\u2019s <italic>Whitney</italic> became <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s stockbroker. The same year, John Morgan\u2019s grandson Pierpont Morgan Hamilton wed a <italic>Blair</italic> daughter. \nAs <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> CEO Benjamin Strong\u2019s Converse wife divorced him, their<italic> Morgan </italic>link fractured. Although Strong\u2019s daughter remained a Converse cousin, his focus shifted to FRS. When UST began retiring debt in late 1919, FRS warned banks against carrying UST bonds on margin, and rates grew as WFC ended purchases. While farm loan collateral peaked in 1920, cotton trades cleared using security collateral. \nThrough inflation, corporations could only afford short-term yields. After resolving to deflate prices to pre-war levels and rebuild loaned out gold reserves, FRS hiked the discount rate 2.25% in the first six months of 1920. As MMUST arbitrage broke apart, banks liquidated UST obligations during the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>. FRS added liquidity via MMUST, reduced NB reserve requirements, and suspended reserve requirements for FRS District Banks as FRS <italic>New York</italic>,<italic> Boston</italic>,<italic> Philadelphia</italic>, and<italic> Cleveland</italic><italic> </italic>lent to the others. \nAlthough LA1906 withdrew monopolized federal coal lands ahead of the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, LA1909 allowed coal lands when discovered on farms and LA1920 leased coal lands factoring in market power as  reprivatized<italic> </italic>railroads and floated coal prices. Like <italic>Kuhn </italic>besought in 1907, IA1920 stabilized profits and exempted railroads from AA1914, allowing roads to cartelize in return for reorg regulation. So, while <italic>Kuhn</italic> guided <italic>PENN</italic> into the 1980s, the Court dissolved <italic>COALA</italic> to separate the RHC\u2019s railroad and mines. Moreover, IA1920 created the <italic>Railroad Labor Board</italic>, which increased wages over 20% by July. Again, Congress postponed AA1914\u2019s prohibition of bankers from serving on the boards of railroads for which they underwrote securities.\nFrom March to July, investors ran from longer term CP. While most loans\u2014including UST bonds\u2014were subject to a 6% usury cap, New York had exempted demand collateral and FRS discounts. As tax-exempt UST bond yields topped 6%, usury limited credit. By May 1920, FRS raised CP discounts to 7%. Although Illinois exempted corporations from usury before the <italic>Panic</italic>, FRS <italic>Philadelphia</italic> kept rates at the usury cap after the Court affirmed a Georgia court\u2019s decision allowing usurious NB discounts in 1919. Defaults increased with rates, freezing the unsecured CP market. As money center banks stopped carrying CP on margin, outlying banks bought CP. Corporations bid up yields as they ran to the capital markets in 1920. \nAs <italic>Goodyear Tire & Rubber</italic> approached bankruptcy in 1920, her banker, <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic>, backed away. When <italic>Cravath</italic> organized creditors, a lawyer representing a group suggested <italic>Dillon</italic>. <italic>Dillon</italic> saved <italic>Goodyear </italic>by issuing high-yield bonds, unsecured debentures, and preferred stock. While a special class of stock rewarded <italic>Dillon</italic> if the reorg succeeded, <italic>Goodyear</italic> hired a management consulting firm. Few banks failed due to runs, and NBs started the FRS<italic> funds money market</italic> (\u201cMMFR\u201d) to trade FRS reserves by 1921. New York passed among the last \u2018<italic>blue sky</italic>\u2019 laws, lowering the common law bar of proving \u2018apparent\u2019 fraud. While <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> financed corporate and PU bonds since 1909, only in 1922 did she establish dedicated corporate and municipal departments.\nIn 1918, Albert Wiggin became CEO of <italic>Chase</italic> NB, which grew using acquisitions, starting with <italic>Metropolitan Bank</italic>\u2019s seven local branches to become America\u2019s fourth largest bank. Likewise, <italic>Chase</italic> made Elgood Lufkin a director. Lufkin was the Chair of <italic>Texaco</italic><italic> </italic>whose father had served <italic>OIL</italic> internationally as an engineer. By 1919, <italic>Chase</italic> elected Reeve Schley a VP. An heir of New York bank <italic>Schley</italic><italic> </italic>and nephew-in-law of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of </italic><italic>New York</italic>\u2019s George Baker, Schley had married a cousin-in-law of the <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic>\u2019s Isham, and Rockefeller families in 1907 and became a lawyer at <italic>Simpson Thatcher</italic><italic>.</italic>\nBy late 1920, President Wilson vetoed Congress\u2019 postponement of AA1914\u2019s prohibition of bankers from serving on the boards of railroads for which they underwrote securities. Without banker monitors, railroads that remained affiliated with underwriters saw declines in valuations, investment rates and leverage ratios, and hikes in funding costs. After IA1920\u2019s <italic>Railroad Labor Board</italic> increased wages in 1920, the Court declared war-time price controls unconstitutional in early 1921, and RHCs sought wages cuts. \nRiots against Blacks broke out in seven cities during 1919\u2019s inflation, but the worst struck in May 1921, in the \u201c<italic>Black Metropolis</italic>\u201d in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the \u201c<italic>Oil Capital of the World.</italic>\u201d The state barred deflationary drilling after the massacre. By October, coal militias set off a class war against White coalers as federal troops occupied West Virginia. And as rising literacy rates in Southern and Eastern Europe nullified the nativist <italic>Literacy Act of 1917</italic>, Congress passed the <italic>Emergency Immigration Act </italic>to create numerical entry restrictions. The restrictive <italic>Immigration Act of 1924</italic> followed soon after, reducing income inequality and allowing for the Great Migration of Southern Blacks to northern factories. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, the militant mood of White miners in South Africa was intensified by unemployment, fears of displacement, and events such as the Russian revolution. The establishment of a workers\u2019 \u2018Soviet\u2019 in Johannesburg in 1919 led and the mining companies\u2019 insistence on implementing changes related to job color bar led to a strike and uprising by White workers in 1921. One of the promoters of the legislation was Boston Brahmin Lawrence Lowell, who instigated the 15% Jewish quota as President of <italic>Harvard Uni</italic>. At the same time, <italic>Harvard</italic> Corp elected the first Catholic, James Byrne, in 1920. (<italic>Harvard\u2019</italic>s first Catholic Overseer was Emperor Napoleon\u2019s great-nephew, who served as secretary of the navy and attorney general under President Theodore Roosevelt.)\nAs Britain found Edgar Speyer guilty of disloyalty in 1921, he fled to America and dissolved <italic>Speyer</italic> London. Cut off from Imperial finance and society, Ernest Cassel died in 1921. He did not live to see his son-in-law Wilfred Ashley lead Britain\u2019s <italic>Ministry of Transportation</italic> through the 1920s. Nor did he see his granddaughter marry Queen Victoria\u2019s great-grandson in 1922, or their children enter the line of succession. \nWhile <italic>Speyer</italic> had affiliated with <italic>Salomon</italic>\u2014founded by <italic> </italic>Haim Salomon\u2019s Alabama-born great-grandson William Salomon, a cousin of the Hendricks and Hart families\u2014in financing Mexican oil and other ventures, <italic>Speyer</italic>\u2019s dimmed future spurred Elisha Walk to leave <italic>Salomon</italic>. Born in New York to Christian London merchants, Walk had married the daughter of a Martinque sugar planter descended from French aristocrat in 1904, and moved to <italic>Blair</italic> in 1920. In 1925, Walk arranged <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s stock purchase of <italic>Pan-American Petroleum</italic>. He later served as director of <italic>Sinclair Consolidated</italic> and chaired <italic>Blair</italic>\u2019s oil HC, <italic>Petroleum Corp of America</italic>. As <italic>OIL</italic> interests rebuilt their dominance alongside <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Blair</italic> engaged with both, especially since John Morgan\u2019s grandson Pierpont Morgan Hamilton wed a <italic>Blair</italic> daughter. \nSimilarly, many of the third generation Guggenheim, Baruch, LaGuardia, Schiff, and Weinberg and other American Jewish banker families intermarried with non-Jews and faced a higher divorce rates and remarriages. <italic>Lehman</italic> also promoted the first non-Jew and non-family member, John Hancock, a Naval officer who Herbert Lehman worked with at <italic>War Industries Board</italic> under Baruch. Likewise, <italic>Lehman</italic> hired Manhattan-born Curtis Dall, who had served overseas in 1918 and graduated from <italic>Princeton</italic>. Dall became manager of her syndicate department in 1924 and, two years later, married FDR\u2019s daughter. However, he left <italic>Lehman</italic> for a Christian firm in 1929 and divorced in 1934.  \nSince German authorities expelled Duala traders from the Sanaga for allegedly arming the Bakoko rebellion of 1895, weakening Akwa control and secured Bell dominance as the main local intermediaries, <italic>Cameroon</italic> RR and improved seaports in 1912, led the Akwa chiefs and Senior Chief Rudolf Bell to protest the seizure of property, relocation of residents, and weakened economic role. When WWI began and international trade collapsed in 1914, German authorities arrested Bell for high treason and executed him the next day. During the war, 117 Cameroon chiefs followed the German retreat into Spanish territory and petitioned King Alfonso XIII. Similar loyalty appeared in Togo and Samoa; German New Guinea appointed chiefs to restore order.\nHowever, the <italic>Treaty of</italic> <italic>Versailles</italic> mandated the division of former German colonies between Allied Powers. In West Africa, Togo was split between France and Britain, dividing the Ewe, Konkomba, and Tschokossi tribes. The Cameroons also saw arbitrary borders that disrupted local communities, with a no-man\u2019s land left between the British and French territories. In German East Africa, Rwanda-Burundi was separated from the main colony, which went to Britain, and placed under Belgian control and purview of <italic>Bank of Belgian Congo</italic>. \nSince SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, <italic>Lambert</italic>, and others funded <italic>Bank of Belgian Congo</italic><italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic><italic>Banque Commerciale du Congo</italic> around 1908, the Congo\u2019s banking sector grew. British <italic>Standard Bank</italic> of South Africa opened a branch in Elisabethville. Portuguese <italic>National Overseas Bank</italic> opened a branch in Kinshasa, later joined by <italic>Banco de Angola</italic>. compete with SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> created <italic>Banque Belge d\u2019Afrique</italic> in 1923, with offices in L\u00e9opoldville, Elisabethville, Stanleyville, and Matadi.\nIn 1917, investors formed <italic>Diamang</italic> to take over the exclusive diamond mining rights for Portuguese Angola. Driven by Belgian SG <italic>Belge</italic> and led by Ernesto Vilhena, son of the former Governor of <italic>Bank of Portugal</italic>, <italic>Diamang</italic> investors were Portuguese <italic>Burnay</italic> and\u2014like in Belgium\u2019s Congo investment from 1906\u2014<italic>Parisienne</italic>, and <italic>COPPER</italic> affiliated <italic>Ryan</italic> and <italic>Guggenheim</italic>. By yearend, former Russian miner Herbert Hoover, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>COPPER</italic> co-founder Boyce Thomson (who soon founded <italic>Newmont</italic>), <italic>Oppenheimer</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and other financial interests from Belgium, France, and Britain Americanized <italic>Oppenheimer</italic>\u2019s South African assets into <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>. \nLikewise, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC incorporated <italic>Merton</italic>\u2014the former British subsidiary of <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic><italic>\u2014</italic>into <italic>British Metal</italic> <italic>Corp</italic> led by a Smyth cousin, to safeguard non-ferrous metals within the British Empire, as a Smyth-in-law was the war-time Governor of South Africa. With the dismantlement of <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>, SG <italic>Belge</italic> backed by national and international investors including <italic>British </italic><italic>Metal Corp</italic> led by Cecil Budd, founded <italic>Minerais</italic> to develop Belgium\u2019s non-ferrous metals sector in 1920. Inheriting a partnership in Welsh copper firm <italic>Vivian</italic>, Budd had married a <italic>Barclay</italic> heiress and in-law of the Smyths until her death, when he remarried her Bevan cousin, related to the Rothschild and Brand families.\n<italic>Rothschild</italic> London expanded <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> beyond Spain to over 22 countries. Since <italic>Morgan</italic>, Herbert Hoover,<italic> Rothschild </italic>Paris, <italic>Oppenheimer</italic> and other Americanized German, Portuguese, and Belgian gold and diamond mines of Africa into <italic>Anglo-American Co </italic>in late 1917, <italic>Lazard</italic> London and New York sold <italic>DeBeers</italic> shares in 1920, <italic>Oppenheimer</italic> and <italic>DeBeers</italic> bought <italic>German Diamond Co</italic>\u2019s Namibian assets in 1920, and <italic>Oppenheimer</italic> absorbed <italic>DeBeers</italic> and <italic>Burma Ruby</italic> in 1929. After Ernest Oppenheimer\u2019s nephew wed an Anglican British aristocrat in 1920, <italic>Oppenheimer</italic> gained control of <italic>Johnson</italic> by 1922. The same year, <italic>Anglo-American</italic>, <italic>Barnato</italic>, and <italic>London Diamond Syndicate</italic> bought stakes in <italic>Diamang</italic> linked to marketing rights. \nTo stabilize the banking sector during WWI, Colonial officials solidified the monopoly of  <italic>British Bank of West Africa</italic> (\u201cBBWA\u201d) by requiring her to handle government accounts exclusively and manage remittances. However, <italic>Colonial Bank</italic> started in 1917, reintroducing competition, which intensified amidst Nigeria\u2019s currency crisis from 1918. \nWhile BBWA sought a larger share of the limited silver coinage available, a consortium of commercial banks effectively took control of BBWA\u2019s operations in 1919 and split British West African banking with <italic>Colonial Bank</italic>. As <italic>Standard</italic> acquired <italic>African Banking Corp</italic> and an interest in BBWA with <italic>Lloyd</italic> by 1920, <italic>Barclay</italic> bought <italic>Colonial Bank </italic>in 1925. The same year, BBWA\u2019s leading stockholder,<italic> Elder Dempster Shipping</italic>\u2019s Owen Philipps, reaffirmed relations with <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> as his daughter wed a Baring descendant related to the Glyns. Soon after, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Mocatta cousin married a great niece of BBWA\u2019s deceased inaugural Chair Alfred Jones.\nStill, <italic>Morgan </italic>failed to Americanize Congo\u2019s Belgo-British <italic>Union Mini\u00e8re</italic><italic> </italic>of Congo. By 1926, SG <italic>Belge</italic> created <italic>African Metals Corp</italic> was in New York, with participation from <italic>Union Mini\u00e8re</italic>. While Belgian and British interests led a cartel to counter <italic>COPPER</italic>, <italic>M</italic><italic>inerais</italic> directors included Oliver Lyttelton. A Spencer cousin of the Churchill, Cavendish, and Grenfell families, Lyttelton married a sister-in-law of the Lyon Bowes family\u2014Abel Smyth\u2019s third great granddaughter and third great niece of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire\u2014who kinterlinked with the younger brother of King Edward VIII and <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Harcourt family.\n<italic>Anglo-South American Bank</italic>\u2014the former <italic>Bank of Tarapaca</italic> of Chile\u2014diversified, acquiring <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic> in 1912, <italic>Commercial Bank of Spanish America</italic> in 1918, and, in 1920, <italic>British Bank of South America</italic> and <italic>Edwards</italic>, an Anglo-Chilean merchant bank that developed Chilean nitrate in the 1850s. British-descended Agustin Edwards III served as Ambassador to Great Britain from 1910 to 1925 and VP and President of <italic>League of Nations</italic> <italic>Assembly</italic> in 1921 and 1922. Edwards\u2019 son, Agustin IV, training at <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris around the time. Having married a daughter of <italic>Tarapaca</italic>\u2019s deceased Chair William Fowler, Edward Barclay directed <italic>Anglo-South American </italic>alongside Edward Bunge and Emile Erlanger.\n Under BOE direction to avoid a crisis, <italic>Barclay</italic> and <italic>Lloyd</italic>, army agent <italic>Cox</italic>, which operated in India, Burma, and Egypt, in 1923. Likewise, <italic>Lloyd</italic>\u2019s <italic>London & River Plate Bank</italic> exchanged shares with <italic>London & Brazilian Bank</italic>, forming <italic>Bank of London</italic><italic> & South America </italic>(\u201cBOLSA\u201d) that year, while <italic>Barclay</italic> acquired half of <italic>Banque de Commerce</italic> in Antwerp. <italic>Barclay</italic> also acquired <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> in 1920 and began takeover discussions with <italic>South African</italic> <italic>National</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>, completing the merger in 1925. Along with reorganizing <italic>Colonial Bank</italic> in the West Indies, <italic>Barclay</italic> soon adding a presence in France. South African operations became the main source of profits for the group, which served as a de facto central bank in some territories. \nSince the 1896 merger of twenty Quaker banks, <italic>Barclay</italic> appointed board directors based on family ties and social standing. In <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s decentralized structure, relatives of former partners joined from provincial banks, but there was no certainty. After Francis Bevan retired in 1916, no Bevan chaired <italic>Barclay</italic> for three generations. The Backhouses ceased to appear on the board after 1913, and the Goslings after 1929. In 1920, a Tuke from the Saffron Walden partner bank joined the Board. Since his grandfather, a Quaker tea and cocoa merchant of York, co-founded <italic>Barclay</italic>, William Tuke joined <italic>Barclay</italic> in 1919, became local director at Luton in 1923, General Manager in London in 1931, Vice-Chair in 1946, Deputy Chair in 1947, and Chair in 1951.\nOne of the few Jewish directors of Christian banks, Raoul Foa became Deputy Chair of <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s colonial bank. Foa was a partner in the bill discounting firm <italic>King Foa</italic> and a director of <italic>British Bank of South America</italic> and <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic>, where he became Chair in 1918. A year before, his daughter married Katz descendant Philip Waley Henriques, Hannah Cohen-Barent Rothschild\u2019s third great nephew. \nThe Foa family, originally from Italy, established roots in France in the 18th century with Solomon Foa, who settled in Bordeaux, and his son received permission from the parliament of Navarre in 1787 to settle in Pau. Later generations included Hippolyte Gradis Rodrigues\u2019 brother-in-law and Joseph Sciama, co-founder of <italic>Suez Canal</italic>. Sciama\u2014a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Aleppo Sciama, through whom he was a Dupont and Fould cousin, and the Goudchaux Chief Rabbi of Metz Guggenheim, making him a Halphen and Rothschild cousin\u2014was related by marriage to Nathalie Rapha\u00ebl in 1898, whose second cousins married a Sassoon and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 David Weill around the same time. \nIn 1923, South Africa centralized control of capital and labor, establishing state corporations such as ESCOM for electricity generation, taking over privately-owned PUs. South Africa\u2019s <italic>Urban Natives Act of 1923</italic> enforced physical segregation in the White areas as part of a policy to exploit and subordinate Black South Africans. Initially subsistence farmers, South African Black laborers moved to gold mines seeking a steady income. The arrival of Indian migrant laborers transformed both their role of Blacks as laborers and citizens. For decades, Blacks were prohibited from building collective strength and joining trade unions. \nWhile relinquishing political control of Southern Rhodesia to White settlers in 1923, <italic>British South Africa Co</italic> retained control of the economy, owning railways, mineral rights, and foreign capital. To promote economic development and close the investment gap, the Settler State established various state enterprises, including a <italic>Land Bank</italic> to finance plantations, <italic>Electricity Supply Commission</italic>, <italic>Iron & Steel Commission </italic>foundries, and marketing organizations but very little foreign capital entered the economy. \nWhile British and American producers implemented global cartels in copper, wool, and coffee after WWI, free<italic> </italic>trade prevailed as the Dutch refused to join. Aside from America, governments also agreed on global tin and rubber trade to stabilize prices. In Britain, Eric Geddes resigned from the House of Commons and joined <italic>Dunlop Rubber</italic>\u2019s board, becoming Chair later that year. <italic>Dunlop</italic>\u2019s territory stretched from Malayan rubber plantations to Midland factories. Eric\u2019s brother Auckland chaired the Royal Commission on Food Prices in 1924 and joined the Board of <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>, becoming Chair in 1925.  \nAlthough Britain had acquired German colonial possessions after <italic>Versailles</italic>, she did not monopolize them. By 1924, a German consortium reacquired Cameroon plantations in London, plantation interests in Cameroon, which was managed by a son of Cologne-born Robert Esser. Since Esser had married Adele Asser Kaufmann, he chaired <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic> and directed others, including <italic>Dresdner</italic> and <italic>South Cameroon</italic> in the 1890s. As Britain restricted Malaya rubber production, <italic>Firestone</italic>\u2014one of four corporations dominating American rubber\u2014obtained a large concession in Liberia, establishing the world\u2019s largest rubber plantation in 1926.\nAmerican farmers\u2014flush with FFLB and FRS credit\u2014were hit worst in the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>. Most bank failures were in agricultural districts, devastating the post-<italic>Panic of 1907 </italic>state deposit insurance systems. Although FRS did not restrict farm credit, only FRS <italic>Atlanta</italic> eased it. Since farmers were free from involuntary bankruptcy, they had little access to credit, and abandoned farms as prices deflated and raised real mortgages. As the Court declared the 1919 price controls unconstitutional in 1921, Congress controlled farm prices and taxed derivatives. When the Court prohibited these, Congress exempted farm co-operatives from AA1914.\nBy 1921, Congress restored WFC for another four years with Eugene Meyer at the helm, helping FFLB increase agricultural credit and mechanize competitively. While farmer bankruptcy filings nationally grew through 1925, agricultural sector opposition to FRS Governor Harding\u2019s deflationary policies led President Warren Harding to appoint Daniel Crissinger as his successor. Harding then advised the Cuban government on financial matters in late 1922 and became Governor of FRS <italic>Boston</italic> from 1923 until his death in 1927.\nMeanwhile, Illinois farms consolidated fastest in communities dependent on FRS. But with the uncertain derivatives regulation, Chicago banks switched from FRS-discountable agricultural processor CP to NYSE loan collateral. President Harding appointed <italic>Central Trust</italic>\u2019s Charles Dawes Director of the Federal Budget in 1921, Dawes helped detail German reparations the <italic>Dawes Plan</italic> with <italic>Morgan</italic>-GE\u2019s Owen Young, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Kindersley, and others. Since <italic>Leather, Mechanic, & Metal</italic> NB President Gates McGarrah bought <italic>Fourth</italic> NB and <italic>Produce Exchange Bank </italic>in 1922., he become the American member of <italic>Reichsbank</italic>\u2019s Advisory Council and <italic>Dawes Plan\u2019</italic>s <italic>Reparations Commission</italic> in 1924. \nWhile Harding appointed Dawes\u2019 brother as Comptroller of the Currency. Following Harding\u2019s death, Calvin Coolidge became President and Charles Dawes was elected as his VP later that year. (After President Warren Harding died in 1923, <italic>Davis Polk</italic>\u2019s Senior Partner John Davis received the Democratic presidential nomination but lost to Calvin Coolidge\u2014not paternally related to <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic>\u2019s Thomas Coolidge, but his fifth cousin twice removed\u2014became President. While John Morgan\u2019s daughter had married a fourth cousin of the former, they were not closely related to the President.) Within a few years, Chicago\u2019s MMSEC money market was on par with Paris\u2014behind only New York, London, and Berlin\u2014banks such as <italic>Central Trust</italic> bought Insull\u2019s securities and pledged them for loans.<italic></italic>\n<italic>International Panics </italic><italic>of the 1920s</italic>\nDuring WWI, Japan\u2019s shipping and shipbuilding industry saw significant growth due to the increased demand from warring nations and the opening of Asian markets to Japanese exports, including coal exports to coal-rich Russian Far East. Tokushichi Nomura\u2014who apprenticed as a moneychanger after his wealthy samurai father disowned him\u2014started his own trading company in 1916, and a bank soon after.As Japan invested in chemical, shipbuilding, metal, and machinery industries, minimal regulation allowed for uncontrolled expansion of electric utilities and fierce price competition. \nHowever, coal inflation spurred enterprises to switch to hydroelectricity, the government promoted mergers and amalgamation to address the issues of redundancy and bankruptcy among smaller firms. While many zaibatsu started, <italic>Suzuki</italic> experienced a spectacular rise during this period, becoming Japan\u2019s largest zaibatsu, surpassing even <italic>Mitsui</italic>, and making Yone Suzuki possibly the wealthiest woman in the world. However, when rice inflated in 1918, even Tokyo hotels did not want to house Yone as angry mobs burned <italic>Suzuki</italic> factories. \nGlobal sugar inflation also led to American investment in Dominican Republic banking by <italic>Citi</italic> NB in 1917 and <italic>Chase</italic> NB in 1920. During the Cuban sugar crisis in 1921, <italic>Citi</italic> enlisted Gordon Rentschler, and subsequently appointed him a director. Born in Ohio to Christian German immigrants, Rentschler began his career in his father\u2019s foundry, <italic>Hooven</italic> <italic>Owen</italic> <italic>Rentschler</italic>. In 1913, after the Miami River flood, Ohio appointed him to establish a flood control system. \nDuring WWI, he worked in Washington, DC, to market his father\u2019s marine engines. Also in 1921, Gordon\u2019s brother wed an extended Rockefeller cousin. Likewise, <italic>Citi</italic> hired Jos\u00e9 Bosch for collections in Havana. While his Catalan-born father owned Cuban sugar mills, co-founded <italic>Santiago</italic> PU in, and gained control of <italic>Spanish Bank of Cuba</italic>, Bosch studied in America, and married the daughter of the President of rum maker <italic>Bacardi</italic>.\nSince FA1913 monetized acceptances, Paul Warburg opposed their use to finance war trade. However, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> London established an accepting syndicate in 1914 for French and Russian governments. As his influence declined due to anti-German sentiment, Paul declined a reappointment to FRS as his term ended in 1918. (So, President Wilson replaced Paul with <italic>Seligman</italic> partner Albert Strauss, who remained until 1920. Although born Jewish, Strauss has married a Christian extended cousin of John Morgan. FRS would have no other Jewish Vice Governors until the 1990s.)\nInstead of trade, a Jew innovated real estate finance. Simon Strau\u00df\u2014a descendant of Frankfurt bankers through Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother\u2014founded <italic>Franklin Trust &</italic> <italic>Savings Bank </italic>in Chicago in 1911 and moved to New York City in 1915. After Strau\u00df\u2019s nephew married <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>VP Max May Max May\u2019s daughter that year, Strau\u00df\u2019s daughter married a cousin of <italic>Kuhn</italic> co-founder Solomon Loeb\u2019s grandson-in-law in 1917. Over this time, Strau\u00df innovated real estate mortgage securities. He incorporated <italic>Strau\u00df</italic> BIHC in Delaware in 1926, formed <italic>Strau\u00df </italic>NB of Chicago in 1928, and founded Carl Laemmle\u2019s <italic>Universal</italic>.\nLikewise, since <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>VP Max May managed large German FX transaction until diplomatic relations were severed. He resigned in 1918 due to his heritage, and became a director of <italic>Foreign Trade Banking Corp</italic>, America\u2019s first discount company of its kind. Still, <italic>Guaranty </italic>hired a few other Jews. Born in Geneva, Switzerland, to wealthy Jewish parents from Ukraine, Wladimir Archawski studied at the Sorbonne and other schools before joining <italic>Guaranty </italic>in New York and Paris from 1920.\nWhile Germany dismantled discriminatory policies that excluded Jews from the judiciary and state prosecutor roles, only two Jews represented in <italic>Reichstag</italic> (\u201cGRS\u201d) after 1919. Having left GGE, Rathenau negotiated reparations with France and Britain as Foreign Minister from 1920. After Austrian Rudolf Hilferding gained citizenship in 1920, the Marxist medical doctor served as Germany\u2019s Finance Minister in 1923 and several times after. While <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>\u2019s Managing Partner Franz Mendelssohn became President of the <italic>German </italic><italic>Industry & Commerce Day</italic>, his son-in-law Paul Kempner, the Austrian nephew of <italic>Oppenheim </italic>Cologne-partnered electro-industrial investment bank <italic>Levy</italic>\u2019s Louis Hagen, joined <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, served as Austrian Consul and a German Democratic Party board member, and Germany\u2019s financial representative at <italic>League of Nations</italic>.\nAs Eugen Guttman retired as Chair of <italic>Dresdner</italic> in 1920, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> alum Henry Nathan\u2014related to Katz-Speyer descendant James Nathan \u201cHardy\u201d of Berlin bank <italic>Hardy</italic>\u2014assumed leadership. Under his direction, <italic>Dresdner</italic> acquired <italic>Meyer Gellhorn</italic> in 1921 and <italic>Luisenst\u00e4dtische</italic> in 1922. Joining the Board in 1919, Walther Frisch, a Christian from the diplomatic service, also served as VP of the Central Association of German Banking and Bankers\u2019 Trade.\nLeading Christian mine owners against Rathenau\u2019s socialism, Hugo Stinnes negotiated instead after nationalists killed Rathenau. While Jakob Goldsmith and Adolph Salomonsohn worked well with Stinnes, Rathenau\u2019s partner Carl F\u00fcrstenberg of <italic>Berliner</italic>, who resigned from Stinnes\u2019 board in protest. The situation deteriorated as Stinnes invested in <italic>Berliner </italic>and sought to buy <italic>Deutsche</italic>. After Rathenau\u2019s murder, his brother-in-law Fritz Andrea\u2014a Katz-Speyer descendant banker at <italic>Hardy</italic> in Berlin\u2014became Chair of <italic>Dresdner</italic>\u2019s board, Deputy Chair of GGE\u2019s board, GRB Central Committee member, as well as chair of the boards of <italic>National Automobile</italic>, <italic>Silesian Electricity & Gas</italic>, and other firms.\nUnlike Britain and France, Germany and America depended on municipal tax and debt until WWI. As the <italic>Reichstag</italic> left the gold standard in 1914, GRB expanded collateral from GRS and select city bonds to all domestic securities. She also supported majority-approved compositions and real estate moratoria. Rather than discount after the war ended , GRB set collateral loans rates. American investors in German securities supported collateral, bank liquidity and FX. <italic>Morgan </italic>affiliates were among the largest American investors.\nFollowing WWI, President Wilson attended the <italic>Paris Peace Conference</italic> with advisors to establish terms for the Central Powers. By 1921, <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic> started to facilitate nonpartisan discussions on international issues. The organization\u2019s leadership included former President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Secretary of State Elihu Root as honorary President, former Solicitor General John Davis as President, and <italic>Cravath</italic>\u2019s Paul Cravath as VP. Former dean of <italic>Harvard</italic> Business and President of <italic>New York Evening Post</italic>, Edwin Gay were Secretary and Treasurer. \nWhile <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Frank Altschul co-founded <italic>Council </italic>and <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Lamont advised Wilson on the <italic>Treaty of Versailles</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic> partners clashed. While Jacob Schiff endorsed the <italic>Council </italic>and supported <italic>League of Nations</italic>, Otto Kahn expressed concerns about <italic>Versailles</italic> and the <italic>League</italic>, and Paul Warburg supported the League with specific reservations. Nor did Schiff\u2019s proposal for a $500 million fund for European restoration, initially pledging $1 million each with <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Sears</italic> cousin Julius Rosenwald, progress as intended. \nDuring the <italic>Paris Peace Conference</italic>, the British delegation included <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Brand and Baronet William Wiseman. Since joining M-16, he developed a relationship with Colonel Edward House, which facilitated communication between the State Department and British officials. While House\u2019s father had worked closely with former <italic>Citi</italic> President Charles Stillman in Texas, House\u2019s son-in-law, <italic>OIL</italic> heir and Rockefeller cousin-in-law Gordon Auchincloss. After the war, Wiseman remained close to House and, in 1921, joined <italic>Kuhn</italic>, which increasingly relied on Christians, as did <italic>Lazard</italic> London.\nWhile MI-6 scaled down after the war, Mansfield Tyser Smyth retained secured control over British espionage abroad, established station commanders under diplomatic cover, and advanced espionage techniques. A relative of his, Granville Tyser qualified as a solicitor in 1907, working at <italic>Linklater</italic> before joining <italic>Paines</italic> <italic>Blyth</italic> <italic>Huxtable</italic> in 1916, amid wartime financial strain that halved the firm\u2019s profits. In 1918, William Paine left <italic>Paines</italic> <italic>Blyth</italic> <italic>Huxtable</italic>, and in 1919, Tyser departed to join <italic>Lazard</italic> London as a Managing Director. While Henry Montefiore Cohen-Barent remained a Senior Partner, <italic>Paines</italic> <italic>Blyth</italic> <italic>Huxtable</italic> merged with <italic>Linklater</italic> by 1920 and become London\u2019s dominant corporate finance law firm. \nIn parallel to MI-6, the Foreign Office\u2019s civilian foreign espionage service, the military oversaw army-focused intelligence led by Herbert Lawrence. The son of a baron, he was commissioned into the military, serving on the intelligence staff during the South African War. In 1892 he wed a daughter of <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s Charles Mills, a cousin of the Grenfells. He resigned in 1903, joining <italic>Glyn </italic>in 1907. Recalled for WWI in 1914, he served and commanded in battle until he became Director of Military Intelligence in 1918 and then Chief of the General Staff until the Armistice. Retiring in 1922, he saw his daughter marry a Smyth in 1923, and then he sat on the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry in 1925 and became Chair of <italic>Vickers</italic> in 1926.\nMeanwhile, Averell, the son of UPR\u2019s Harriman, along with his directorship in <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> four years after graduating <italic>Yale</italic>, formed <italic>Merchant Shipbuilding Corp</italic> in 1917, which soon became the largest merchant fleet under American flag. In 1919, he formed securities broker<italic> Harriman</italic>. <italic> </italic>Along with investing in the New York affiliate of <italic>Thyssen</italic>\u2019s Rotterdam bank, <italic>Harriman</italic> promoted George Walker to President, who then started <italic>Harriman</italic> Berlin in 1922, and invested in Silesian zinc and hired <italic>JG White</italic> engineer Joseph Ripley.\nBy 1922, GRS taxed securities sales, granted GRB independence, and reduced city subsidies to pay reparations. As cities cut services, GRS required GRB to cover notes with GRS bonds. Since GRB could discount CP\u2014not corporate or city\u2014bonds and the <italic>mark</italic> shrank against CP<italic>.</italic> <italic>Mark</italic> inflation drove cities and debtors to grain and coal indexed bonds. As Germany failed to deliver coal per <italic>Versailles, </italic>France occupied the Ruhr. Amidst coal inflation, GRB discounted Ruhr debt and Bavaria elected Adolf Hitler. \nAfter losing Galicia, Austrian banks restructured and expanded their presence in Poland by acquiring or partnering with local banks. While <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> transferred branches to her Polish affiliate <italic>Warsaw Discount Bank</italic> and allied with <italic>Galician Mortgage Bank</italic> of Lemberg, <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic>\u2019s <italic>Galician Bank for Trade & Industry</italic> transformed into <italic>Bank Ma</italic><italic>l</italic><italic>opolski</italic> with directors including aristocratic politician Janusz Radziwill, Count Alfred Potocki, and Jan Reitzes. \nSimilarly, <italic>Mercur Bank</italic> and <italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic> devolved operations into <italic>Komercjalny</italic> and <italic>Powszechny</italic>, which gained <italic>Wiener</italic>\u2019s banks. <italic>Powszechny</italic> was led by Wladyslaw Steslowicz, a conservative Galician politician, who served as Minister of Post & Telegraphs in the early 1920s. and Waclaw Fajans. From a Jewish merchant family in Warsaw, Fajans was related to the Zbytkower and Toeplitz families, served in the Polish Treasury, rising from financial affairs officer to Deputy Minister.\n<italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna invested in Czech coal and Polish banks as the state-monopolized the coal, salt, tobacco, alcohol, match, and lottery industries, dismissing Jewish employees in the process. With investment from<italic> Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> controlled Poland\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Warsaw Discount Bank</italic>. \n<italic>Handlowy Bank </italic>received investment from <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic>, led by Giuseppe Toeplitz, whose father co-founded <italic>Handlowy</italic>. Along with <italic>Generali </italic>of Trieste, international shareholders in the venture included <italic>Harriman</italic>, <italic>Lower Austrian Discount </italic>of Vienna, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic>, and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>. As <italic>Handlowy</italic> Saint-Petersburg continued to function after the 1917 Soviet Revolution, the branch became a link between Western Europe and the Soviet Union. \nSince <italic>British Overseas Bank</italic> formed in 1919\u2014with the largest investors being insurer<italic> Prudential</italic>,<italic> Glyn</italic>, <italic>Union Bank of Scotland</italic>, <italic>Anglo-South American Bank</italic>, <italic>Dominion Bank</italic> of Toronto, <italic>Hoare</italic>, <italic>Northern Banking Co</italic> of Belfast, and <italic>TURK</italic>\u2014, <italic>British Overseas Bank</italic> assumed control of Adolf Peretz\u2019s Warsaw private bank and took over <italic>Handlowy</italic> Saint-Petersburg\u2019s branches in Polish Lodz, Latvian Riga, and Estonian Dorpat to form <italic>Anglo-Polish Bank</italic> in 1920. One of Warsaw\u2019s few private bankers was Rafael Szereszowski, a Katz descendant cousin of the Dynin and Gunzburg families, who inherited his father\u2019s bank.\nAmong the first to obtain approval for a fur trade agreement with the Soviet Union, the Eitingon family traded Russian furs since the 19th century out of Leipzig. In 1921, the Eitingon family founded <italic>Lo</italic><italic>dzki Bank</italic> in Lodz. Growing in New York and acquiring fur companies in Saint-Louis, <italic>Eitingon</italic> issued stock through <italic>Goldman</italic> by 1928.  Having been concentrated in urban areas before WWI, Poland\u2019s Jews were increasingly marginalized with public discrimination. Unlike the 19th century, when <italic>Kronenberg</italic> and <italic>Bloch</italic> were being prominent, state policies that excluded Jews from positions of influence. \nJews still played leading roles in shetls and smaller cities. In Lublin, 1,657 of 1,714 Jewish-owned workshops had reopened by 192, employing 4,871 people, mostly in clothing and food production. Jews, excluded from government jobs, turned to petty trading or small businesses. The Jewish-controlled leather industry accounted for 95% of production and tanning. Jewish-owned enterprises included a distillery, brewery, brickworks, flour mills, and a tobacco factory, later nationalized. Alongside unions like <italic>Guild of Needleworkers</italic> and <italic>United Guild of Leather Workers</italic>, 10 mutual aid societies and Jewish banks, such as <italic>Loan & Savings Bank</italic>, <italic>Mutual Aid Society of Trading Clerks & Small Traders</italic>, <italic>First Bank for Artisans</italic>, <italic>Merchants\u2019 Bank</italic>, <italic>Householders\u2019 Bank</italic>, and <italic>Cooperative Bank</italic>, supported the community. \nIn Lithuania, Christians controlled credit. While <italic>German Darlehnskasse Ost</italic> managed credit and money circulation after independence, Lithuania established <italic>Trade & Industry Bank</italic> in 1918 to manage state credit. As <italic>Cooperative Bank </italic>operated small credit societies, <italic>Central Jewish Bank</italic> supported small urban credit societies. The largest banks, however, were two dozen joint-stock commercial banks and mutual credit societies. Of these, <italic>Economic Bank</italic> was largest.\nDescended from a well-off Catholic peasant family, Juozas Vailokaitis was ordained in 1905, while his brother Jonas led an agricultural company. In 1912, they established a company to buy noble estates and sell them in installments to farmers. After WWI, Jonas founded <italic>Economic Bank</italic> to develop Lithuanian enterprises and cooperatives. The brothers also founded a brick and tile producer, food and flax exporting companies, a textile trading firm, and an agricultural machinery manufacturer \nBoth brothers served in the Constituent Assembly. To replace the deprecated German currency, Lithuania sought to found <italic>Bank of Lithuania.</italic>  In 1922, Juozas opposed relying on the Soviet gold deposit to raise capital, advocating instead for domestic funding and strong state oversight. Resigning as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Vladas Jurgutis, an ordained priest, became the first Chair of <italic>Bank of Lithuania</italic>. <italic>Trade & Industry Bank</italic> co-founder Adam Pr\u016bsas joined as his deputy. \nAmong Lithuania\u2019s few powerful Jews, the Rachmilevichs traded Belarus timber in the early 1800s and intermarried with the Pernas family of WFilna, linking them to the Katz, Landau, Rafalovich, Cah\u00e9n, Louri\u00e9, and other families. One of his cousins-in-laws was Riga\u2019s Eliezer Ettingen\u2014a Katz-descendant cousin-in-law of Berlin, Gunzburg, Brodsky, and Nathansohn\u2014drove the creation of Baku kerosene refiner <italic>Mazut</italic> with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris at the turn of the century.\nDuring WWI, Nachman Rachmilevich served as Vice Chair of the Central Committee for Jewish Refugees. In late 1918, he joined the Council of Lithuania and became Deputy Minister of Trade & Industry until 1920, when he co-founded <italic>Central Jewish Bank</italic> and was elected to the Constituent Assembly. His brother Solomon served on<italic> Bank of Lithuania</italic>\u2019s Board.\u00a0\nSince Estonia created <italic>Bank of Estonia</italic> to issue currency and fund agriculture and industry in 1919, she adopted the <italic>mark</italic>, following Finland. While <italic>Estonian </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic> of 1802 continued to issue long-term farm loans, <italic>Estonian Mortgage Bank</italic> of Dorpat replaced a liquidated prewar bank and sold securities to state institutions in 1921. As the State and Christians dominated industry, <italic>State Timber Industry</italic> led lumber and <italic>Luther</italic> controlled plywood exports.\nWhile few Jews returned to Latvia after the war, Jews were among the few who dared to invest in rebuilding Latvian industry. Along with Berlin-Schneurson and <italic>Shell</italic> co-founders, over one-fourth of Riga\u2019s industry was soon in Jewish hands. From 1921, Jews founded six major banks. A. Rabbinovitz and Zaks led <italic>Bank of Northern Countries</italic>, with Katz-descendant and cousin-in-law of the Louri\u00e9s as a director. \nWhile the Hoff and Lewstein brothers directed <italic>International Bank of Riga</italic>, N. Soloveitschik facilitated Jewish-German investment in <italic>Bank of Libau</italic>, and Czech and Swedish capital supported A. Kogan\u2019s <italic>Private Bank of Latvia</italic>. Hermann Epstein founded <italic>Merchants Bank of Libau</italic>, with <italic>Hambro</italic> and <italic>Citi</italic> NB as London and New York correspondents. In contrast, Christian Latvian nationalists founded <italic>Farmers Union</italic>, <italic>Farmers Bank</italic>, and <italic>Union Bank</italic> to counter Jewish banking influence and fund political goals. Since investing in <italic>Anglo-Polish Bank</italic>, Estonian and Latvian capital pulled back after deflationary policies led to the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>. \nAs Lithuania\u2019s <italic>Trade & Industry Bank</italic> failed to the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>, Jonas Vailokaitis was elected to <italic>Bank of Lithuania</italic>\u2019s Board. Likewise, Lithuania limited Jewish access to credit and government positions, particularly after the 1926 coup. Estonia reformed her monetary and banking systems in 1927 with financing from <italic>Hallgarten</italic>. The government raised a foreign loan and used part to restore <italic>Bank of Estonia</italic>\u2019s gold reserve. In 1928, the government replaced the Estonian <italic>mark</italic> with the gold-backed <italic>kroon</italic> and reorganized <italic>Bank of Estonia</italic> as a private company with majority government ownership and dominated by Christian cliques. \nAustrian banks also faced increased competition from French banks, which drilled for oil in Polish Boryslaw of former Austrian Galicia. As his Katz-descendant sisters converted and wed French aristocrats, assimilated Galician Horace Finaly grew <italic>Paribas</italic> and became General Manager in 1919. Still, <italic>Paribas</italic> shareholders <italic>Demachy Seilli\u00e8re</italic>\u2014cousins of traditionally Catholic Seilli\u00e8re with Charles Demachy having led <italic>Paribas</italic> for a year until his death in 1911\u2014switched alliances to <italic>Parisienne</italic> in 1919. <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>OIL</italic> split German and Hungarian capital participations as Romanian oil bank <italic>Marmorosch </italic>into Romanian and French hands. Starting in 1919, <italic>French Co of Eastern Europe</italic> started with operations in Romania with <italic>Marmorosch</italic>. \nAs Eastern Europe refocused from Austria following WWI, British manufacturers sought to expand, targeting Romania for its resources and strategic location. As French <italic>Creusot </italic>bought <italic>\u0160koda </italic>steel company in 1919, Britain<italic> </italic>sought to collaborate with Romanian industry. Romania nationalized <italic>Re\u0219i\u021ba</italic> steelworks in 1919, previously owned by <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s <italic>Austro-Hungarian State </italic>RR, and sought foreign investment. In 1921, Romania joined the Little Entente, a political alliance with Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, initially aimed at countering Hungary. That same year, Romania allied with Poland against the Soviet Union. In 1922, <italic>Vickers</italic> purchased 30% of <italic>Re\u0219i\u021ba</italic>\u2019s shares to sell artillery and industrial products.\nBefore WWI, Frankfurt Blumenthals linked <italic>Marmorosch </italic>to<italic> Speyer</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York as Cecilia and Blanche\u2014the daughters of Solomon Ulmann, not closely related to the Ulman family\u2014wed Ferdinand Blumenthal and Siegfried Wertheim\u2014of Hesse but unknown lineage\u2014, until he absconded, after which a divorce was followed by marriage to Serbian Milenko Vesni\u0107. Ulmann\u2019s son Julien wed Gertrude Barclay\u2014an affiliate of <italic>Vanderbilt</italic> and extended cousin of <italic>Astor</italic> and <italic>Roosevelt</italic>\u2014and <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter Bank</italic>, <italic>Berliner</italic>, and <italic>Paribas</italic> incorporated <italic>Marmorosch </italic>in Bucharest under the leadership of Mauriciu Blanco following the death of Jacob Marmorosch. Blanco was the only Jew on <italic>Marmorosch</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>board since conversion into a limited company<italic>.</italic>\nFollowing the death of her husband Ferdinand Blumenthal, Cecilia Ulmann married into the Perigord-Montmorency French nobility in 1917. After WWI, Blanche Ulmann\u2019s husband Milenko Vesni\u0107 served PM of Serbia and Serbian Minister to France. As Mauriciu Blanco\u2019s son Astride took over as the sole Jew on <italic>Marmorosch</italic>\u2019s board, Romanian legislation in 1920 nationalized assets belonging to citizens of defeated countries, including the withdrawal of Russian <italic>rubles</italic> in Moldova and Austrian <italic>crowns</italic> in Transylvania and Bukovina. This encompassing measure extended to the banking sector, where foreign capital participation from German, Austrian, and Hungarian entities became subject to takeover. \nSo, citizens of those countries who invested in Romanian<italic> Marmorosch</italic>, <italic>Romanian Credit</italic>, and other banks, and <italic>Star</italic>, <italic>Concordia</italic>, <italic>Venga</italic>, and other oil companies<italic> </italic>sold shares to Romanian, British, and French investors. Investors in<italic> Deutsche</italic>\u2019s <italic>Star</italic>, the oldest and largest of these were Romanian (<italic>Marmorosch</italic>, <italic>Banca Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103</italic>, <italic>Romanian Credit</italic>, <italic>Banca General\u00e1</italic>, and <italic>Banca Tz\u00e1r\u00e1neasc\u00e1</italic>), British (<italic>Stern</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Persian Petroleum</italic>, and <italic>Barnum</italic>), and French (<italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Mallet</italic>, <italic>Mirabeaud</italic>, and their representatives Ernest Mercier and Marcel Champin. \nWhile <italic>Union d\u2019Electricit\u00e9</italic> PUHC\u2019s Mercier served as President of <italic>Omnium </italic>in 1920 and affiliated with <italic>Paribas</italic>, Champin was<italic> Mirabaud</italic>\u2019s oil representative.) <italic>Chrissoveloni </italic>of<italic> Romanian Commercial Bank</italic> focused on hydroelectric development and was supported by <italic>Lower Austrian Discount Bank </italic>of Vienna, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic> of London, and <italic>Harriman</italic> of New York. <italic>Banca Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103</italic> played a key role in the coal and metallurgical industries and held interests in lumber and petroleum.\nAs <italic>Romanian National Bank</italic> took over the Bukovina branch of <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austro-Hungarian Bank </italic>in Czernowitz, the newly founded<italic> Banca Comerciala Nationale </italic>absorbed <italic>Mercur\u2019</italic>s Czernowitz branches. While Jews lost influence and were limited by other restrictions, some managed several banks, including <italic>Marmorosch</italic>, <italic>Banca Moldova</italic>, <italic>Romanian Credit</italic>, and <italic>Comerciala Nationale</italic>. \n<italic>Marmorosch </italic>strengthened relations <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna affiliated <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> in 1919 and <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1920. <italic>Marmorosch</italic>\u2019s French directors included Andr\u00e9 Benac (<italic>Paribas </italic>and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>), Edouard Go\u00fcin (<italic>Paribas</italic> and rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic>), Andr\u00e9 Homberg (<italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>), Th\u00e9odore Laurent (<italic>Wendel</italic>\u2019s <italic>French Co of the Far East</italic>), and Achille Levy-Strauss (who married a Rheims connected to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic>).\nBlanco also became a director of <italic>Romanian Credit</italic> as <italic>Paribas</italic> had interests in both and many others.  Like many of these banks, <italic>Romanian Credit</italic> acquired equity in other banks, including <italic>Chrissoveloni </italic>of<italic> Romanian Commercial Bank</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Marmorosch </italic>branched to New York, Paris, Constantinople, and elsewhere. Out of Czernowitz, <italic>Marmorosch </italic>financed large-scale industry and trade in Bukovina and Moldova, <italic>Marmorosch </italic>played a pivotal role in Romania\u2019s economic growth. She contributed loans to the federal loans for Union in 1919 and Reconstruction in 1920, and invested in oil, lumber, and textiles, and over 130 Romanian joint-stock companies and banks, such as <italic>Industrial Bank</italic> in 1921. \nFollowing Romania\u2019s annexation of Bessarabia, Chisinau\u2019s Jews were disconnected from key pre-WWI Russian markets and faced heavy taxes and stiff competition from Romanians. Despite this, Jews maintained dominance in commerce and industry, owning 82% of Chisinau\u2019s stores by 1924. Cooperative loan institutions and other organizations offered vital support to Jewish craftsmen. \nLikewise, since Romania annexed Transylvania, Cluj (Kolozsv\u00e1r) became a key industrial and financial center, with Jewish entrepreneurs driving much of the growth. While Jozsef Moskovits founded <italic>Transylvania Bank</italic> and Lajos Ritok established <italic>Discount Bank</italic>, the Sebesty\u00e9n family was involved in <italic>Commercial Credit Institute</italic>. Herm\u00e1n Meklmer\u2019s <italic>Automobilia</italic> dominated the automobile industry, Zolt\u00e1n Steuermann ran <italic>Linda</italic> candy factory, and Tivadar Herczeg\u2019s chemical factory expanded the city\u2019s industrial base. Jews also played a key role in the metal, iron, building materials, tinware, furniture, and leather manufacturing industries.\nAs antisemitic violence escalated in Romania, <italic>Marmorosch</italic>\u2019s Astride Blanco was attacked in 1924 by students at Bucharest economic institute for criticizing government policies. A week after Solomon Ulmann\u2019s granddaughter, Julian\u2019s daughter, became engaged to a Chicago <italic>OIL</italic> executive in 1925, her cousin, Blanche\u2019s daughter, became engaged to Blanco. <italic>Paribas</italic> later pulled out of <italic>Marmorosch </italic>due to risk concerns. Since Greece conquered Salonica from Turkey in 1912, <italic>Marmorosch </italic>hired agents from <italic>Bank of Salonica</italic>. And as Greece recognized their political status by 1920, Jews led the paper, textiles, and medicinal industries and were active in heavy industry and banking. \nLike they had done for decades, Ottoman authorities targeted the Greek Christians during WWI. In 1914, the Ottoman CUP regime launched a boycott severing Greek Christian trade and canceled Muslim debts to Greek merchants in Kerassounda under threat of hanging. The same year, authorities blocked rent payments, pressured banks to cut Greek credit lines, and demanded repayment of advances, leading Greeks to pawn valuables and seek funds from Constantinople to maintain hazelnut exports through Dedeagatch and Constanza. \nAs Turks imposed forced partnerships, monopolized commerce, and confiscated goods from Greek shops without receipts. In 1915, Ottoman conscription removed Greek men, leaving families unsupported. In 1916, as Russian forces advanced, Turkish civilians and refugees formed bands that looted Greek villages, burned churches, killed residents, and assaulted women and girls, forcing survivors into the mountains where many died from exposure or starvation. From 1916 to 1917, Ottoman authorities blocked Greek trade, seized assets, and imprisoned merchants on false charges. After the Russian withdrawal in 1918, attacks on Greeks resumed, completing expulsions through continued violence, forced labor, deportation, and economic dispossession.\nSince Greece entered WWI in 1917, with <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>and <italic>Parisienne</italic>-affiliated <italic>Bank of Athens</italic> financing the war effort. In competition with the French, Anglo-Greek Gregory Embedocles founded <italic>Commercial Bank of Greece</italic> in 1905, he was later joined by his brother-in-law, Dimitrious Petrokokkinos, a Rodocanachi and Ralli cousin who was born and educated in London. In 1918, Petrokokkinos\u2019 cousin-once-removed married a Barclay descendant Bevan, whose cousin-twice-removed was an uncle of <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Brand. \nHaving built his interests in <italic>Parisienne </italic>and <italic>Nationale</italic>, British <italic>Vickers</italic> representative Basil Zaharoff acquired and reorganized the Parisian bank <italic>Mayer</italic> into <italic>Seine</italic> in 1918, with investors including the Vickers shipping family, Gregor Isvolsky, the Greek Chiot Mavrogordatos, and <italic>Thalmann</italic> Paris. In 1920, he reorganized the German <italic>Banque d\u2019Orient</italic> into <italic>Banque Commerciale de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e</italic> in Constantinople. A year later, in 1921, he helped establish <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Huiles de P\u00e9trole</italic>, securing British oil transport interests in France, with capital from his <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Navale de l\u2019Ouest</italic> and <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic>. \nZaharoff also bought more shares in <italic>Parisienne</italic>, seeking to merge it with his other interests. Meanwhile, he joined Britain to support Greece in the <italic>Greco-Turkish War</italic> from 1919, Turkey finally emerged victorious in 1922. That year, Embedocles established <italic>Commercial Bank of the Near East</italic> in London, linking Greek communities across several regions.\nWhile France monopolized Turkey\u2019s Heraclea coal mines before the war, Italy and Britain gained access afterward WWI. Turkey\u2019s loss of territory with the <italic>Treaty of S\u00e8vres</italic> in 1920 and the subsequent <italic>Greco-Turkish War</italic> fueled Turkish nationalist sentiment, which opposed the Ottoman ruling house, now under European influence. In 1922, Mustafa Kemal \u201cAtat\u00fcrk\u201d led the movement that deposed and exiled Sultan Abdmajid II and abolished the Ottoman sultanate, and in 1924, dissolved the caliphate and introduced a secular constitution. Although Turkey officially adopted secularism by removing Islam as the state religion in 1928, over 90% of the population remained Muslim. \nLikewise, Atat\u00fcrk withdrew the privileges of Christian churches and removed all remaining reasons for residence from the privileged Greek and Armenian families in 1922. By 1923, <italic>Zafiropoulo Zarifi</italic> closed its counters in Istanbul to reopen them abroad. Instead, a Zarifi married an aristocratic British Yorke, kinterlinking with Earl Rendlesham, the son of an ennobled Huguenot British Thellusson and cousins of the Spencers. While <italic>TURK</italic> functioned as the central bank for a few more years, Atat\u00fcrk provided much of the initial capital for a national bank, <italic>Turkiye Is Bankasi</italic>, and his aide, Celal Bayar, became the first president. <italic>Turkiye</italic> quickly supported the launch of Turkey\u2019s first insurance company, <italic>Anadolu Sigorta</italic>, and began supporting Turkey\u2019s industrial and economic development.\nAs the <italic>Treaty of Versailles</italic> seized assets after WWI. Germany and Austria lost their coal and oil colonies to Czechoslovakia, France, Poland, and Romania. So, links between German and Austrian banks deepened or transformed. <italic>Wiener</italic> continued her old connection with <italic>Deutsche</italic>, as well as with <italic>Dresdner</italic>. <italic>Deutsche</italic> also bought a stake in <italic>Hauptbank</italic>. <italic>Disconto</italic> maintained her historical link to <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> and <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>, and partnered with <italic>Gutmann</italic> and <italic>Ephrussi</italic>. <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter </italic>maintained relations with <italic>Mercur</italic>, while <italic>Berliner</italic> had a looser connection with <italic>Lower Austrian Discount</italic>. <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic>, <italic>Delbr\u00fcck Schickler</italic>, <italic>Heydt</italic>, and <italic>Liebieg</italic> established a joint limited partnership. While <italic>Bavarian Mortgage & Exchange Bank </italic>acquired stakes in <italic>Salzburger</italic>, <italic>K\u00e4rntner</italic>, <italic>Klagenfurt</italic>, and <italic>Scherbaum</italic>, <italic>Bayerische Vereinsbank</italic> took stakes in <italic>Bank f\u00fcr Ober\u00f6sterreich </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Salzburg</italic> and, with <italic>Lower Austrian Discount</italic>, in <italic>Tiroler </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic>.\nBefore WWI, Austria depended on Czech coal and Galician oil for energy. After <italic>Versailles</italic>, she drilled for oil. As a public PU developed hydroelectricity in the Alps, which GGE sought to expand under the leadership of Petschek\u2019s Kallir cousin-in-laws. BGE took over British and Czech <italic>Osram</italic> electric lamp operations from<italic> </italic><italic>Siemens</italic> and GGE, <italic>Zivnostenska Bank</italic> associated with Dutch <italic>Philips</italic> played pivotal roles within the International Bulb Cartel. But Czechoslovakia\u2019s saw significant foreign involvement. Swiss capital, mainly through <italic>Brown Boveri </italic>and <italic>Siemens</italic>\u2019 1892 PUHC, invested in <italic>Severoceske Elektrarny</italic>. This allowed the electric manufacturer to vertically integrate with miners. Belgian investment came via <italic>Societe Electricite de Transpose de l\u2019Europe Centrale</italic>, associated with <italic>Czech Discount Bank</italic>.\n<italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic> transformed after 1918 into an international consortium involving <italic>Morgan </italic>in New York, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> in London, <italic>Amsterdam Bank</italic> in Amsterdam, <italic>Solvay</italic> in Brussels, and UBS in Geneva. The <italic>Rothschild</italic> London-<italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>-<italic>Baring</italic> syndicate issued the first post-war bond in London by a Central European country for Czechoslovakia in 1922. Using tax or commodity collateral, <italic>League of Nations</italic> acted as a trustee. Others followed. \nAs Austrian banks destabilized, BOE and a French banking consortium took over <italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic>, relocating her headquarters to Paris but maintaining substantial operations in Austria. <italic>Kuhn </italic>and BOE consolidated state debt and <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>into <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s<italic> Creditanstalt</italic> with <italic>International Acceptance</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>. What did not go into the new <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, went into the new <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank. </italic>\nSince co-founded by <italic>Glyn</italic>, <italic>Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Austrian </italic><italic>Bank</italic> became the fifth largest Viennese bank, acquiring Bohemian industrials and Galician petroleum. After sequestering <italic>Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Austrian </italic><italic>Bank</italic> London under the Enemy Trading Act during WWI, BOE became her main creditor. By 1922, BOE Governor Montagu Norman became the lead investor in a reorganized <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>. British directors included BOE Comptroller John Nairne, Peter Bark, and Ernest Harvey. During the conversion, Rosenberg sought a local Austrian affiliate and targeted <italic>Biedermann</italic>, founded in 1792, with limited partners from the Biedermann and Klein families and from <italic>Offenheim</italic>, which had interests in Galician oil.\nThey transferred Czech assets to <italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak Bank</italic>, a subsidiary of <italic>Anglo-International Bank</italic>, with Petschek as a key local stakeholder, and led by Peter Bark. Descended from the Dukes of Courland, the Lutheran Ukrainian-born Bark had trained at <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Berlin before growing <italic>Imperial Russian State Bank </italic>(\u201c<italic>State Bank</italic>\u201d) in the 1890s. In 1911, Bark was appointed Assistant Minister of Trade & Industry and then of Finance in 1914. His initiatives included the prohibition of vodka trade during WWI and drafting income tax laws. Following the events of 1917, Bark was briefly arrested before moving to Crimea. In 1920, he emigrated to Britain and led various financial institutions, including <italic>Russian Financial Agency Workers\u2019 Association</italic>.\nAs a result, Austrian lost control of both <italic>Ango-Austrian</italic> and <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> to British and French capital, respectively, although both banks became less prominent. A director of both <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> and the Anglo-French <italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic>, Ernest Harvey headed London discount broker <italic>Allen Harvey Ross</italic>. He had advised the Exchequer and, after the Armistice, served in Archangel, Russia, overseeing the issue of <italic>ruble</italic> notes convertible into <italic>pounds</italic>. In 1919, he became financial adviser to the British representative on the Inter-Allied Rhineland Commission, and in 1920 he served as Inter-Allied Financial Adviser to the Austrian section of the Reparation Commission.\n<italic>Biedermann</italic> came under the leadership of Josef Schumpeter. A Christian born in Austrian Moravia, his stepfather was a member of the Austrian nobility and cousin married a converted descendant of the Jeiteles family related to Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s sister. From 1921, he partnered with lawyer Gottfried Kunwald\u2014a descendent of Katz, Koppel Frankel, Primator Wolf Popper, and the H\u00f6nig and Meisel families\u2014connected to Chancellor Ignaz Seipel and Foreign Minister Heinrich Mataja, and corporate attorney for <italic>Anglo-Austrian</italic>. That bank, Schumpeter\u2019s group provided the license, and Biedermann supplied capital with <italic>Arnhold</italic> of Dresden.\nBiedermann also interlinked directorates with <italic>Wiener Handelskreditbank</italic>, including former Count Josef Ezdorf and Naftaly Rohatyn. Rohatyn\u2019s father was born in 1858 in Lemberg to a rabbinical family and served as Rabbi of Zloczow in the 1890s. During his tenure he contracted with the Austrian government to build barracks in Galicia, which brought him wealth. Naftali managed <italic>Deposition Bank</italic> in Stanislav and moved to Vienna during WWI. His cousin once removed Wilhelm also became a banker in Vienna.\nAs Hungarian electricity remained underdeveloped. <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Creusot</italic>\u2019s <italic>Schneider</italic> founded <italic>Union Europ\u00e9enne Industrielle</italic> (\u201cUEI\u201d) by 1920, which acquired Russia-focused <italic>Bank of Northern Countries </italic>of Paris and developed coal and electricity primarily in Czechoslovakia\u2019s <italic>\u0160koda</italic> and Poland, but also Austria, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. \nErnest Weyl was instrumental in starting UEI. Of unknown connection to other Weils, Alsace-born Weyl was an engineer who directed the Ottoman <italic>R\u00e9gie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Tabacs </italic>before WWI, when he became a key administrator at the Ministry of Armament. He then advised the French High Commission in Istanbul and was the delegate Director of UEI from 1919. In 1922, Weyl joined <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019Entreprises</italic> as Managing Director, overseeing operations and managing <italic>Electrobel</italic>, the electric utility subsidiary.\nUEI allied with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna and <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic> to electrify Hungary in competition with BGGE. <italic>Creditbank</italic> also partnered with <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Schneider</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Paris to reorg railroads. Along with joining UEI to invest in <italic>Creditbank</italic>\u2014which soon gained access to Western credit through <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam\u2014,<italic> Parisienne</italic> engaged in <italic>Hungarian State</italic> RR and Budapest\u2019s state workshops with<italic> Schneider</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Gunzberg</italic> Paris as <italic>Disconto </italic>industrialized Hungarian textiles from 1921. \nSince the <italic>Treaty of Trianon</italic> of 1920 fractured the multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire, the collapse of the imperial legal framework from 1849 isolated Jews in Hungary, Austria, and the successor nations. Like before the war, a handful of interrelated Jewish and converted families dominated Hungarian industry and banking. The Deutsch and Ulman families along with their in-laws dominated Hungary\u2019s agricultural banks and the sugar trade before WWI. \nAfter Adolf Ulman died in 1925, his son, Gy\u00f6rgy, inherited the leadership of <italic>Hungarian</italic> <italic>Creditbank</italic>. He converted to Catholicism after WWI but was denied membership in the National Casino. Gy\u00f6rgy\u2019s third cousin twice removed, a Catholic-born descendant of Moritz Ulman, Tibor Scitovszky, studied in Kalksburg, Budapest, and Paris before joining the Ministry of Trade in 1899. He moved to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1920, attended the peace talks, and became undersecretary in 1922. In 1923, he became Managing Director of <italic>Creditbank</italic>, leaving to become Foreign Minister for a year in 1924.\nAfter the war the disintegration of the Habsburg Monarchy redrew national boundaries and restructured industrial holdings. The industrial combine of <italic>Lower Austrian Discount </italic>shifted from 62 Austrian and 21 Hungarian companies in 1917 to 40 Austrian, 12 Hungarian, and 21 Czechoslovak companies in 1921. In 1918 <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>arranged with <italic>Zivnostenska Bank</italic> to manage her Czechoslovak interests. French investors held one-quarter of <italic>\u00d6sterreichische</italic>\u2019s capital by 1919, followed by investments from <italic>Solvay</italic> in 1920 and from <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Morgan </italic>in 1923. In 1924 Eugene Schneider joined the board of <italic>\u00d6sterreichische</italic>.\nIn the new Czechoslovakia, banks with Hungarian, German, and Jewish shareholders lost assets because of frozen funds and war loans. As new currency and customs system shifted economic ties from the former Empire in 1918, six banks with Hungarian shareholders closed, and two branches of the <italic>Hungarian Discount & Exchange Bank</italic> merged with <italic>Discount & Agrarian Bank</italic>, with equity transferred to Christian-owned <italic>Tatra </italic><italic>Bank</italic>. Later, two branches of <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic> became <italic>Slovak Creditbank</italic> under the Nostrification Act. \nIn 1919, <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank</italic> separated from <italic>Lower Austrian Discount</italic> and acquired <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s Czech branches with investment from Christian land mortgage <italic>Zivnostenska Bank</italic>. <italic>Zivnostenska </italic>aligned initially with <italic>Solvay</italic> and Brussels banks, then with <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Schneider</italic>\u2019s <italic>Union Europ\u00e9enne Industrielle</italic>, and <italic>Philips</italic> in Eindhoven, alongside related Dutch banks. \nAs<italic> \u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic>  and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt </italic>invested in <italic>Zivnostenska </italic>alongside <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg, and <italic>International Acceptance Bank</italic> of New York. While Otto Feilchenfeld, a first cousin twice removed of Bondi-in-law Rabbi of Posen, had been Chair of <italic>Poldina Hut</italic>, VP of <italic>Prague Iron Co</italic>, a board member of the boards of <italic>Lower Austrian Discount </italic>and <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank</italic>, his son Max soon took over <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank</italic>.\nAfter 1919, Czech banks established numerous branches in Slovakia and played a dominant role in its credit system, influencing local banking and capital markets. In 1919, <italic>Zivnostenska </italic>acquired the control of <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank </italic>from <italic>Lower Austrian Discount Bank</italic>. To link with Slovakia, <italic>Bohemian </italic>partnered with private banker Arthur Franklback, who operated in Bratislava, Sillein, Losonc, and Ungvar. While his family kinterlinked with descendants of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe Moravian rabbinical families, Franklback\u2019s third cousin became a director of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>. <italic>Mercur</italic> retained a participation after selling her Prague branches to <italic>Prague</italic> <italic>Commercial Bank</italic> as well as in her Bratislava branch, which gained <italic>Danish</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Mortgage</italic> and <italic>Banco di Roma</italic> as investors and retained Jewish management.\n<italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak Bank</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>French counterpart was <italic>Prague L\u00e4nderbank</italic>, although French interests were more splintered. Post-war, <italic>Czech Agrarian Bank</italic> aligned her interests with French capital in <italic>Prague L\u00e4nderbank</italic>.  While <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic><italic> </italic>invested in <italic>Prague Credit Bank</italic>, <italic>Union Bank of Bohemia</italic> (\u201cUBB\u201d) received investment from <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. Continuing to run UBB, Herbert and Francis Bondy were related to <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>\u2019s Kornfeld, Max Warburg\u2019s uncle\u2019s cousin, as well as the Bondi cousin Feilchenfelds of <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank</italic>. Along with UBB, Bondy cousin-in-laws Mayou kinterlinked with the Petschek family in 1921 and reorganized their sugar operations into <italic>Hej\u010d\u00edn Sugar, Spirits, & Press Yeast</italic>.\nSince pre-WWI <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> co-investor Bohemian coaler Ignaz Petschek\u2014son of a Wertheim cousin-law and husband of a cousin-law of Galician private bankers Kallir and Natanson\u2014established their own Czech bank and acquired <italic>Starck Mining & Industry </italic>in 1917, married a Katz-descendant Caro in 1920, and founded <italic>Aussiger Mining</italic>. Including Petschek, Jews comprised a third of Czech industrial capital. Petschek kinterlinked with Thorsch, whose bank employed Siegmund Kornfeld before he led <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>. \nBy 1921, Austrian Prague and Vienna banker Alfons Thorsch\u2014descended from Katz, Behrend Lehmann, Samuel brother, and <italic>Cahn</italic>\u2014founded a Czech oil refinery in 1889, he transferred ownership to Amsterdam through his relatives Edgar Fuld\u2014who had married Marie Mendelssohn Warschauer\u2014and Katz descendant Robert Cahn Cahn Daniels May at<italic> Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>. Petschek\u2019s Kallir cousin-in-laws managed GGE <italic>Austria</italic> through the 1930s.\nLikewise, since Sigmund Popper Rosenfeld married David Biedermann\u2019s granddaughter and joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> in the 1860s and <italic>Vienna</italic> <italic>L\u00e4nderbank </italic>in 1880, his descendants ran Vienna bank<italic> Rosenfeld</italic>. Rosenfeld\u2019s nephew Wilhelm Kux began at <italic>Vienna</italic> <italic>L\u00e4nderbank</italic> in 1883, moved to <italic>Lower Austrian Discount Bank</italic> in 1904, became VP there, and from 1925 served as President of <italic>Alpine Mining Co</italic> and managed <italic>Poldina Hut</italic> and <italic>Prague Iron Co</italic> interests tied to enterprises in Czechoslovakia. \nWilhelm\u2019s brother, Emil, joined <italic>Kux Bloch</italic> bank in Vienna in 1922 and served on the board of <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic> from 1927, working with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> and <italic>Kleinwort</italic>. Since 1904 Kux\u2019s cousin, also named Wilhelm Kux, had married the daughter of Romanian banker Jacques Rubenstein, who focused on the timber trade. While Rubenstein\u2019s brother had married Katz-descendant Anna Byk Rottenberg, whose brother had married a daughter of <italic>Marmorosch</italic>\u2019s Abraham L\u00f6bel.\nHowever, like in Romania, WWI disrupted communication between <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Balkanique</italic> in Bulgaria, allowing Austro-Hungarian interests in the latter to grow. Post-war, <italic>Parisienne</italic> restored her position in the bank and increased shareholding with <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, <italic>Wiener</italic>, and SG <italic>Belge</italic>. During WWI, Bulgaria\u2019s first joint-stock bank, <italic>Girdap</italic>, grew her credit, but post-war involvement in speculative ventures like <italic>First Bulgarian Cement Co</italic> and <italic>Bulgarian Macedonian Bank</italic>. \nThe final blow came in the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic> when <italic>Bulgarian National Bank</italic> closed <italic>Girdap</italic>\u2019s account, triggering a run from deposits, and the bank\u2019s collapse. By 1922, Maria Puliev Geshov\u2019s son wed Gubidelnikov\u2019s daughter, reinforcing the link between Romanian <italic>Puliev Georgiev</italic> and <italic>Banca Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 </italic>to the Bulgarian <italic>Targovska Banka</italic> and their respective political parties. \nAfter WWII, <italic>Targovska </italic>and other banks\u2019 Austrian and Hungarian investors were internationalized. Before WWI, <italic>Targovska </italic>investors<italic> </italic>included by<italic> \u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic>\u2019s Wiener, <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>\u2019s <italic>Banque Hongroise</italic>, and <italic>Paribas</italic>. Since an international consortium took over <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>in 1918, <italic>Banque Hongroise </italic>linked with a British group of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Westminster Bank</italic>, <italic>Continental Industrial Trust</italic>, <italic>Middle European Corp</italic>, and <italic>Gu</italic><italic>in</italic><italic>ness Mahon</italic>, with participation from <italic>Dillon </italic>and <italic>Continental Security Corp</italic> in New York, <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic> in Zurich, <italic>Horre</italic> in Amsterdam, and <italic>Hallgarten</italic> in Hamburg after 1923. \nWhile Jews were active in Bulgarian import and export before WWI, government industry nationalizations and cooperative societies gradually reduced their presence. In banking and insurance, Jews occupied minor roles in locally funded banks, with competition from demobilized officers and Russian refugees after 1918. They held few leading roles in enterprises, though not in industry, and remained small-scale tradespeople with few high-ranking merchants. Their weaker social and political standing made them less competitive against Greek, Armenian, and Bulgarian counterparts. \nBulgarian Jews produced few business leaders, unlike Jews in Germany, Austria, or Czechoslovakia. Cooperative societies and the economic crises from the 1920s displaced many Jews from their traditional commercial roles, and opportunities in crafts or factories were scarce due to the self-sufficient peasant population. By 1932, only two significant Jewish tobacco export firms remained, and subsequent government policies eliminated private exporters dealing with tobacco.\nA cousin of the Bulgarian Ari\u00e9 Angel Kuyumdji started as a clerk at <italic>Alkanska Bank</italic>. After WWI, he obtained Spanish citizenship in 1919 and founded <italic>Kuyumdji</italic> in Sofia to finance Bulgarian exports to America. In 1923, <italic>Kuyumdji</italic> became <italic>Franco-Belgian Bank</italic> with investment from<italic> Cr\u00e9dit Foncier d\u2019Alg\u00e9rie et de Tunisie</italic> and SG <italic>Belge</italic>. The bank controlled several companies, including the sugar factory in Ruse, <italic>United Tobacco Factories</italic>, the tobacco houses <italic>Fernandez</italic> and <italic>Emin</italic>, and established subsidiary banks:<italic> Banque de Plovdiv</italic>, <italic>Banque Bulgare du Nord</italic>, and <italic>Banque Bulgaro-Belge</italic>.\nHowever, foreign banks faced difficulties in Bulgaria. <italic>Balkanique</italic> declined between 1922 and 1928 due to lack of foreign investment. <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Bulgare</italic> ran into problems in 1924, requiring Hungarian and Austrian partners to provide additional funding and<italic> Paribas</italic> to convert her debts into shares. \nForeign-capital banks organized seven financial groups, each controlling six to twenty-five industrial companies. Bulgarian-capital groups also grew: <italic>Bulgarian Bank</italic> with thirty-five companies, <italic>Targovska Banka</italic> with fifteen, and <italic>Girdap</italic> with five, mostly secondary enterprises. <italic>Paribas</italic> became the first foreign investor in <italic>Targovska</italic> Banka, acquiring a quarter of her shares by 1926 and holding stakes in the Badashte coal mine and Adree power station. While his brother remained at <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>, Max Horwitz left to join <italic>Hallgarten</italic> before WWI. In 1923, as <italic>Hallgarten</italic> arranged American financing for <italic>Mercur</italic>, Max joined <italic>Mercur</italic>\u2019s board. By 1926, <italic>Hallgarten</italic> acquired <italic>Boissevain </italic>of New York to funnel American and Dutch capital into Europe.\nAfter separating from Austria, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, & Slovenes formed in 1918\u2014soon renamed Yugoslavia\u2014Croatian capitalists started <italic>Zagreb National Bank</italic> in 1918, <italic>Yugoslavian </italic><italic> National Bank</italic> was to become the central bank. So, <italic>Zagreb National</italic> became<italic> </italic><italic>Slavic Bank</italic> and <italic>Yugoslavian </italic><italic> National</italic> took over <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austro-Hungarian Bank </italic>branches. In 1922, <italic>Slavic </italic>merged with <italic>Union-Yugoslav Bank</italic> with the French controlled former <italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic>, and acquired shares in <italic>Credit Bank of Ljubljana</italic> and joined her board.\nHowever, Yugoslavian banking systems began to develop along distinct national lines. In Slovenia, <italic>Credit</italic><italic>a</italic><italic>nstalt</italic> Ljubljana became <italic>Credit Institute for Commerce </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Industry</italic> and branched to Serbian Belgrade in 1920. That same year, <italic>Zivnostenska</italic>\u2019s <italic>Ljubljana </italic>merged with local banks and expanded across the Kingdom. Other active institutions included <italic>Adriatic</italic>, <italic>Illyrian</italic>, <italic>Carniolan</italic>, and <italic>Maribor Discount</italic>, while <italic>Cooperative Economic Bank</italic>\u2014aligned with the Catholic camp\u2014converted into a joint-stock company. <italic>Ljubljana</italic>, <italic>Credit Institute</italic>, and <italic>Cooperative Economic</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> soon controlled half of Slovenian joint-stock capital. \nThe Serb-dominated government negotiated a loan with <italic>Blair</italic> of New York for <italic>Zagreb-Split</italic> RR in Croatia in the early 1920s. So, the Western-connected <italic>Serbian-American Bank</italic> and <italic>Serbian-Swiss Bank</italic> were short-lived, but the revived <italic>Franco-Serbian Bank</italic> regained far more importance. Croatian Zagreb emerged as the chief Yugoslav hub for foreign capital. \nWhile <italic>Wiener</italic> was allowed to keep Zagreb and Belgrade branches for necessary relations unlike most Austro-German banks, Zagreb\u2019s five major banks including <italic>Yugoslovenska Banka </italic>and <italic>Zivnostenska</italic>, controlled half of Yugoslav bank assets. Likewise, Croat banks led finance in Bosnia-Hercegovina, Dalmatia, Vojvodina, and Macedonia. Austrian capital constituted about 30% of Croatian bank capital, with Hungarian and Czech shares comprising 10% each. These banks facilitated industrial investment, especially in timber processing.\nJewish influence fell since pre-WWI, when the Zander and other families played roles in Croatian finance and led Serbian banks, which mostly fell in influence. A son-in-law of National Party member Matija Mrazovic, Franjo Svrljuga (1844\u20131921) directed <italic>Croatian Discount Bank</italic>. His son Stanko (1880\u20131958) married the daughter of Independent National Party member Sime Mazzura, and was a director of <italic>Zagreb Stock Exchange</italic>. \nFranjo\u2019s daughter married a nephew of Milan Kresic (1844\u20131929), who co-founded <italic>Zagreb Savings </italic>and <italic>Croatian Commercial Bank</italic>. Kresic wed a sister of Milan Turkovic (1857\u20131937), who held positions in <italic>Croatian Commercial </italic>and <italic>Zagreb National</italic><italic> Bank</italic>. Turkovic married a daughter of Serbian politician Jovan \u017divkovi\u0107, whose other daughter married Gustav Pongratz (1851\u20131925). Pongratz chaired <italic>Croatian Discount </italic>and presided over <italic>Industrialists\u2019 Union of Slavonia </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Croatia</italic>. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1925, </italic><italic>Slavic </italic>and other banks failed, leading to reorgs. Through <italic>Seligman</italic> London and <italic>Seligman</italic> Paris, <italic>Seligman</italic> New York arranged a bond issue for <italic>State Mortgage Bank of Yugoslavia</italic> in 1927. The following year, the Yugoslav government sought a loan for currency stabilization and railway projects. British banks advised a delay but offered partial funding. <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> asked <italic>Rothschild</italic> London to require that works go to them, with a portion allocated to <italic>Vickers</italic>. While the loan was not issued, <italic>Batignolles</italic> received the contracts.\nIn Albania, before WWI, <italic>Wiener</italic>, <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, and several Italian banks attempted to establish <italic>Albanian National Bank</italic>, resistance from Western European financial and political centers led to the initiative\u2019s failure. In 1920, Britain secured Albania\u2019s admission to <italic>League of Nations</italic>. <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> began operations in land abandoned by Italy. <italic>OIL</italic> entered the market, and both trusts, backed by their governments, sought to influence Tirana authorities. Under Ahmed Zog, Albania undertook industrial modernization and considered a temporary financial protectorate. \nIn 1924, a revolution brought Mgr Fan Noli to power. Italy gained influence over Zog, securing his commitments and withdrawing support from Noli. The following year, Albanian divided concessions were divided among Italian, French, British, and American companies, covering various regions. As Italy gained monopoly over Albanian cabotage and maritime traffic, Albania founded <italic>Albanian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic> in Rome, under the leadership of <italic>Credito Italiano</italic>\u2019s Mario Alberti per Mussolini. The two countries signed a \u2018friendship and security\u2019 pact in 1926, and a \u2018defensive alliance\u2019 pact in 1927 with Zog becoming Europe\u2019s first and only Muslim King.\nThe post-WWI era also increased colonial bank competition across Africa and Asia. Like in Japan, WWI stimulated India. As <italic>Morgan </italic>extended to promote reconstruction, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> branched to India by fused with the Scot-descendant bank <italic>Yule Catto</italic> from 1917, soon directed by Vivian Smyth. James Mackay, the son of an Arbroath shipmaster, James Mackay left Scotland and was a Partner at <italic>Mackinnon Mackenzie</italic> Calcutta by 1874, where he saved the Bombay office from bankruptcy. \nHe served as President of <italic>Bengal Chamber of Commerce</italic> from 1890 to 1893 and a Director of <italic>Chartered Bank of India, Australia, & Chin</italic>a from 1893 to 1897. Knighted for his role in India\u2019s currency reforms, Mackay returned to Britain in 1894, joining <italic>British India Shipping. </italic>Offered the viceroyalty of India in 1909, he opted for a peerage in 1911, becoming Baron Inchcape. Becoming Chair of <italic>British India Shipping</italic> in 1913, he merged her with <italic>Peninsular & Oriental Shipping </italic>(\u201cP&O\u201d) in 1914. During the war, Mackay\u2019s son married a Brooke of Sarawak.\nLocal minority middleman also accelerated Indian industrialization. Marwari heirs focused on jute for textiles and cordage. Born in Jaipur State to one of India\u2019s richest merchant families, Ghanashyamdas Birla built his first jute mill in Calcutta in 1919. That same year, the Jain Sarupchand Hukumchand established a jute mill nearby. While Sarupchand\u2019s father, Magniram, began moneylending and opium trading in 1850, Magniram\u2019s grandfather, Seth Pusaji, had earlier settled in Indore in 1789 and became a successful court banker. From Assam, Jute trader Surajmal Jalan moved to Calcutta in 1900 and founded<italic> Surajmal Nagarmal</italic> in 1927. His rise in the industry was facilitated by his father-in-law, Ramchandra Bajoria, a pioneer in the jute trade.\nSince the Parsee Jamsetji Tata died, his successors shifted their focus to the cement industry in India. The Tata group\u2019s first successful cement venture, <italic>India Cement</italic>, formed in 1912, inspiring others to enter the industry. The Tatas also founded <italic>Tata Industrial Bank </italic>and <italic>Shahabad Cement </italic>during WWI. Between 1913 and 1919, they expanded into engineering, electrochemistry, textiles, construction, sugar, vegetable oil production, India\u2019s first industrial bank, and <italic>New India Assurance</italic>. After WWI, Tata recruited British civil servants and Railway Board officers, including JCK Peterson for<italic> Tata Iron & Steel Co</italic> in 1919. Ratanji Tata also helped fellow Parsee Ardeshir Shroff to secure an apprenticeship at the London branch of <italic>Equitable Trust </italic>of New York.\nWhile the Indian rupee followed the soaring price of silver during WWI, the trend reversed with the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, along with a decline in European imports, leading to a trading surplus for India. However, challenges arose due to the inability to introduce a paper currency to replace the old silver currency and the breakdown of the prewar international transfer mechanism. By 1921, India merged her three chartered Presidency banks\u2014<italic>Bank of Bengal</italic>, <italic>Bank of Bombay</italic>, and <italic>Bank of Madras</italic>\u2014into the independent <italic>Imperial Bank of India</italic> to serve as both the central bank for the Indian government and a bankers\u2019 bank for the growing Indian banking sector.\nLikewise, although <italic>Tata</italic>\u2019s endeavors thrived during the war but faced challenges as economic conditions worsened in 1922. Consequently, <italic>Tata Engineering</italic>, <italic>Tata Electro Chemicals</italic>, and <italic>Tata Sugar Corp</italic> failed, and in 1923, <italic>Tata Industrial Bank</italic> merged with Sassoon\u2019s <italic>Central Bank of India</italic> as Walchand Hirachand, a director in <italic>Tata Construction</italic>, acquired that concern. The cement industry remained intensely competitive. <italic>Tata Mills</italic> and <italic>Tata Oil Mills</italic> survived with support from related companies. By 1925, <italic>Tata Iron & Steel Co</italic> relied heavily on government protection, with its board including figures like David Sassoon.\nElevated to Earl of Reading for his achievements during WWI, Rufus Isaacs became the first Jewish Viceroy of India, serving from 1921. He was committed to the Government of India Act of 1919, which sought to increase Indian participation in governance despite opposition from British conservatives, and took a firm stand against racial discrimination. He worked with Robert Brand\u2019s cousin Thomas Freeman, the Governor of Bombay in 1913 and Madras from 1919, where they contended with civil disobedience from Mahatma Gandhi, a British educated lawyer whose father and grandfather were PMs of a West Indian principality. Balancing his responsibilities, Isaacs ordered the arrest of Gandhi for sedition in 1922. \nIsaacs also faced uprisings, including the Moplah rebellion in 1921 and Sikh unrest in 1922. To address Muslim concerns, he requested a revision of the <italic>Treaty of S\u00e8vres</italic> in 1922 to protect Turkish sovereignty and the status of Muslim holy sites. He returned to Britain in 1926 as Marquess of Reading, took on corporate leadership roles, including <italic>National Provincial Bank</italic> and <italic>London & Lancashire Insurance</italic>, of which he became Chair. \nThrough the <italic>Treaty of S\u00e9vres</italic> in 1920, Turkey gave up Arab provinces to the Hashemite dynasty in the Near East. Under Imperial Turkey, the Ottoman Sultan was akin to the \u2018pope\u2019 of Sunni Islam. During WWI, Britain promised Arabs inland Syria to revolt against German-allied Turks. In the Arab Revolt of 1916, the Shia descendant of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s blood, Hashemite Sharif Husayn, proclaimed himself \u2018<italic>King of the Arab lands.</italic>\u2019 After WWI, Sultan Abdmajid II and his family fled to France. \nAlthough Husayn soon lost his claim from the Kingdom of Hejaz to Saudi Arabia, one of his sons became King of Jordan while the other became King of Iraq and Syria. The latter King Faisal appointed a Sassoon cousin as his first Finance Minister, and was cordial with Jews until his death in 1932. As <italic>Paribas</italic> took over <italic>TURK</italic>\u2019s Syrian bank in 1919, <italic>Bank of Syria</italic> became the issuing bank, later becoming <italic>Bank of Syria & Lebanon</italic> to account for Syria\u2019s changing borders and a more independent French-controlled and Christian ruled Lebanon. \nIn Hejaz, Saudi Arabia allowed Jeddah\u2019s merchants to form a commercial assembly in 1926, continued the Ottoman and Hashemite economic structures under Saudi rule. The assembly\u2019s foreign merchants included the Dutch banker Van Pol, who adopted the name Muhammad Mahdi. The same year, the Dutch state-owned <italic>Dutch East Indies Co </italic>successor <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> founded <italic>Saudi Hollandi Bank</italic> in Jeddah to serve the pilgrims from the Dutch East Indies. Although the bank did not take deposits or make loans, she operated as Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank for many years by maintaining the country\u2019s gold stock. One of <italic>Saudi Hollandi</italic>\u2019s managers was of the Hadhrami Attas family.\nLike the Ottomans, fellow-Turco-Mongolian Qajar-ruled Persia remained neutral during WWI, she became a battleground for Turkish, Russian, and British forces. After the war, various local rebellions and separatist movements arose in Persia\u2019s provinces. Rida Khan Pahlawi, a military leader involved in the 1921 coup d\u2019\u00e9tat that overthrew the Qajar dynasty, became the Shah of Persia in 1925, aiming to modernize the country. \nLikewise, Turkish nationalism surged, and under Turkish Military leader Mustafa Kemal\u2019s led abolition of the Ottoman sultanate in 1922 and ended the caliphate in 1924, deposing the last Ottoman. Both centralized power and introduced modernization reforms that raised the quality of life at the expense of individual freedoms. \nWhile <italic>Bank of Abyssinia</italic> maintained financial obligations with <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic>, young, foreign-educated Ethiopians \u2018progressives\u2019 assailed the monopoly. At the same time, Italy sought to expand territorial and economic control in Africa, including French and British Somaliland, the railway, and <italic>Bank of Abyssinia</italic>, which were met with resistance from France and Britain. In Italian Libya, Jews made up a fifth of industrialized Tripoli and Benghazi. Alongside with distilleries, soap production, and gold work, <italic>Nahum</italic>, Livornese cousin-in-laws of the Sassoon, Cattaui, and <italic>Banco di Roma</italic>\u2019s Arbib families, stood as the sole private banker during this time. By 1922, <italic>Nahum</italic> co-founded, Libya\u2019s first transportation company, <italic>General Car</italic>.\nSince the Ottoman genocides challenged Armenians from the 1890s, the aristocratic Sarofim and other Christian Copt landowning families increased their influence since the 1870s with financing from European Jews. While Cassel\u2019s star in Britain dimmed, Cattaui\u2019s political, religious, and banking achievements continued to accelerate. Shortly before dying in 1920, Sephardi Joseph Cattaui\u2014whose brother-in-law Raphael Suar\u00e9s founded <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic> and <italic>Aswan Dam</italic> with Ernest Cassel\u2014co-founded <italic>Misr</italic> <italic>Bank </italic>with Egyptians to support Arab traders to finance industry, commerce, and agricultural ventures, including Egypt\u2019s textiles and sugar-refining. Most of <italic>Misr</italic>\u2019s founders hailed from wealthy Egyptian landowning families. \nWith a degree from <italic>Egyptian Law School</italic>, Takat Harb <italic>Credit Fonder Egyptien</italic> and earned the respect of directors Suar\u00e9s, Rolo, and Cattaui. Advocating for an Egyptian-owned bank, Harb met Midhat Yakin, a descendant of Muhammad Ali\u2019s sister. With a European education and law degree, Yakin made a fortune during the cotton land boom of 1920. Yakin was a close associate of the king and cousin of the prime minister. \n<italic>Misr</italic> soon formed nine joint-stock companies. While the largest was <italic>Cotton Spinning & Weaving Co</italic>, others included <italic>Paper Manufacturing Co</italic>, <italic>Fisheries Co</italic>, <italic>Flax Co</italic>, <italic>Silk Weaving Co</italic>, and <italic>Trading & Cotton Ginning Co</italic>. The latter opened its first factory in al-Misri hometown, while another factory opened where Yakin owned land. However, <italic>Misr</italic>\u2019s reliance on landowners proved to be a weakness when the economic depression hit this class.\nWhile Europeans dominated industry, few non-Jewish Egyptian nationals served on corporate boards. <italic>Misr</italic> had an exclusively Egyptian board, albeit with one exception, Joseph Cicurel, an Egyptian Jew. Among the remaining directors, only seven were non-Jewish Egyptian nationals, and Abd Siufi was the sole individual with significant commercial and financial expertise. While Siufi inherited his father\u2019s goods trade business, the other directors primarily held positions as political leaders, chosen for their influence in Egyptian politics. \nThese directors held positions on the boards of <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic>, <italic>Credit Foncier Egyptien</italic>, <italic>Electric Light & Power Supply Co</italic>, and <italic>Cairo Water Co</italic>, which maintained close ties with the state and held privileged, and sometimes monopolistic, government concessions. As most of Egypt\u2019s banking system was foreign-owned, ruinous competition persisted until banks cooperated to open clearinghouses in Cairo and Alexandria in 1928. From then, the sole Egyptian-led bank, <italic>Misr</italic> <italic>Bank </italic>had close ties to the new <italic>Belgian Bank</italic>, established in 1929 by <italic>Sino-Belgian Bank</italic>, American <italic>Chase</italic>, and Swiss <italic>Commercial Bank of Bale</italic>.\nLikewise, Iranians challenged the British imperialism. <italic>Imperial Bank of Persia</italic> initially held the exclusive right to issue Iran\u2019s paper currency from its founding in 1889. Since the nationalization of <italic>Banque Russo-Asiatique</italic>, Soviet <italic>Narodny</italic> established <italic>Narodny</italic> Tehran by 1925. In 1928, Iran established <italic>Iranian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>(\u201c<italic>Bank Melli</italic>\u201d) with participation from Persian Jewry to replace <italic>Imperial Bank</italic>\u2019s note-issuing privilege and to serve as the country\u2019s state bank. By 1931, <italic>Imperial Bank</italic> was forced to surrender her note-issuing rights, transferring monetary authority to <italic>Melli</italic><italic>. </italic>\nAbol Ebtehaj was the banks\u2019 most famous Persian employee. Born in Rasht, Ebtehaj studied in Paris and Beirut before moving to Tehran and joining <italic>Imperial Bank</italic> in 1920 as a junior clerk. He was promoted to Assistant Chief Interpreter in 1924 and to Assistant to the Chief Inspector in 1929. That year, Ebtehaj married Maryam Nabavi, connected with the Shah\u2019s Court and Soviet trade. He resigned from <italic>Imperial Bank</italic> in 1936 due to lack of advancement for Persians and joined the Ministry of Finance. In 1942 he became Governor of <italic>Melli</italic><italic> </italic>and his brother co-founded <italic>Iranian Airways</italic>.\nAnd while Jacob Safra founded <italic>Safra</italic> Beirut in the thriving metropolitan, in Syrian Lebanon after WWI, fellow Sephardi Khedouri Zilkha started <italic>Zilkha Bank</italic> in Baghdad in 1927, <italic>Turkiye Tutunculer Bankasi</italic>, <italic>Turkiye is Bankasi</italic>, <italic>Denizli Iktisat Bankasi</italic>, and <italic>Turkiye Imar Bankasi </italic>started in Turkey from 1924 to 1928. Two decades after much of Eurasia, Turkey delegalized the opium trade in 1933. While the Turkish press broadly covered the almost immediate arrest and prison sentencing of <italic>Safra</italic> Istanbul\u2019s David Safra, he was acquitted in 1934 due to lack of evidence.\nWhile <italic>Bank of Algeria</italic> sought <italic>Bank of Morocco</italic>\u2019s issuance privilege to become the central bank of the Maghreb as the protectorate faced monetary difficulties in 1919, <italic>Paribas</italic> defended <italic>Bank of Morocco</italic> by forming a counter-coalition with Moroccan authorities and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, established <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of Colonies </italic>HC, and bought <italic>Bank of Morocco</italic> shares from Russian, Swedish, and German investors. Through <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of Colonies </italic>HC, <italic>Paribas</italic> expanded investments across Madagascar, sub-Saharan Africa, and Indochina. By 1925, <italic>Paribas</italic> defeated <italic>Bank of Algeria</italic> and solidifying <italic>Bank of Morocco</italic> as one of her key instruments. In the same year, <italic>Paribas</italic> co-founded the note-issuing <italic>Bank of Madagascar</italic> formed. \nIn Angola, although <italic>National Overseas</italic> maintained its monopoly and Portugal banned foreign competition, Portuguese bankers competed from 1918. The situation worsened due to rapid inflation and financial difficulties, prompting Portugal and <italic>National Overseas</italic> to jointly fund <italic>Banco de Angola</italic> in 1926, effectively maintaining <italic>National Overseas</italic>\u2019 position and stabilizing the currency. \nMeanwhile, France faced a monetary crisis. Since France occupied the German Ruhr in 1923, MMMOF and the <italic>franc</italic> collapsed. As <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam facilitated Austro-German currency attacks on the <italic>franc</italic> in early 1924, <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Morgan </italic>intervened. <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Frank Altschul devised an intervention plan that led to a successful counterattack against speculators, while Maurice Boyer of <italic>Paribas</italic> coordinated efforts with <italic>Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust</italic> and other Americans to curb speculation in New York. In France, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Raymond Philippe, Andr\u00e9 Meyer, and Michel Lazard convinced the Poincar\u00e9 government to pledge gold reserves for currency stabilization. \nFollowing this, <italic>Lloyd</italic>, <italic>Barclay</italic>, <italic>Westminster</italic>, and <italic>National Provincial</italic> disbursed a 4 million <italic>dollar</italic> loan was in London, and BDF secured a 100 million <italic>dollar</italic> loan, temporarily halting the decline of the <italic>franc</italic>. Between January and March, speculative pressure intensified, with <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> collaborating to manage the crisis. By March 29, the <italic>franc</italic> began to rebound, leading to the collapse of Vienna\u2019s <italic>Allgemeine Industriebank a</italic>nd liquidity crises at other banks, including <italic>Austro-Polish</italic>, <italic>Austro-Orient</italic>, <italic>Kolmat</italic>, <italic>Kettner</italic>, <italic>Bruder Nowak</italic>, and <italic>Union Bank</italic>. <italic>Biedermann</italic> failed soon after.\nIn America, around this time, the Reparations Commission appointed him as president of the committee to investigate the possibilities of the German budget in 1923,<italic> Central Trust</italic> of Illinois\u2019 Charles Dawes joined <italic>Morgan</italic>-GE\u2019s Owen Young, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Kindersley, and others to represented bondholders in brokering the <italic>Dawes Plan</italic> for German debt relief and return of the Ruhr in 1924. \nSince French President Alexandre Millerand supported conservative candidates in the 1924, the socialist majority forced his resignation. By June, President Gaston Doumergue appointed \u00c9douard Herriot to lead MOF, and <italic>Paribas</italic> launched a loan for MOF by late 1924. Against growing inflation, Herriot hired <italic>Lazard</italic> to sell <italic>pounds</italic> in 1925. However, within a month of operation, BDF reached her <italic>franc</italic> limit. To conceal that BDF exceeded the limit, Herriot manipulated BDF\u2019s records. \nAfter the deception became public, Painlev\u00e9 replaced Herriot, but speculative attacks persisted. As <italic>Lazard</italic> supported MOF\u2019s recovery plan to inflate the <italic>franc</italic> and issue a loan with an FX guarantee, BDF opposed it. By June, BDF could not support the <italic>franc</italic>. A year later, MOF shifted right, and Raymond Poincar\u00e9 issued non-inflationary FX-guaranteed loans, stabilizing the <italic>franc</italic>. \nAmidst the crisis, leftwing politician Joseph Caillaux was the Head of MOF. He had held the post sporadically since 1902 as well as serving briefly as PM. In 1926, Caillaux facilitated the appointment of \u00c9mile Moreau as Governor of BDF. The son of a provincial justice of the peace and great-grandson of a representative of the Third Estate in 1789, Moreau pursued legal studies and served as a Finance Inspector from 1896. On Caillaux\u2019s recommendation in 1905, Moreau became Governor of <italic>Bank of Algeria</italic>, where he served for 21 years. In the summer of 1926, Moreau implemented the stabilization of the French <italic>franc</italic>. To prevent undue influence on BDF\u2019s operations, he distanced himself from large deposit banks, discounters, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, and <italic>Wendel</italic>.\nDuring the crisis, France pursued various fiscal policies. In late 1925, MOF had imposed a surtax on real estate sales to foreign buyers and increased taxes on securities. So, investors ran from foreign securities to MOF bonds. As MOF raised interest rates in federal savings banks (\u201cMSBs\u201d) and eliminated withdrawal penalties, deposits increased fivefold, and MOF opened to foreign creditors from August 1927. Facing a need for liquidity, MOF granted a lease of her matchstick tax monopoly to Swedish industrialist and financier Ivar Kreuger from 1926.\nWhile MOF first chartered match monopolies in 1872, <italic>Lee</italic><italic> Higginson</italic> floated Ivar Kreuger\u2019s <italic>International Match</italic> IHC in America to lend to Europe with match monopoly charters from 1923. With Percy Rockefeller on the board, <italic>International Match</italic>\u2019s profits came from her relationship with Kreuger\u2019s <italic>Swedish Match</italic>. Similarly, Poland leased her match monopoly to Kreuger\u2019s cartel from 1924. By 1925, Kreuger organized <italic>Swedish American Investment</italic> IHC to invest in various securities. As <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris facilitated the entry of <italic>Kreuger</italic> into France in 1928, all three <italic>Lazard</italic> houses joined <italic>Kreuger</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Vernes</italic>, and <italic>Shell</italic> to establish the Quebec-based <italic>French & Foreign Investing </italic>IHC.\nConditions were similar across France\u2019s borders. From 1921 to 1924, under the Conservative government led by Georges Theunis\u2014connected to electric industrialist <italic>Empain</italic> who started <italic>Banque Industrielle Belge</italic> in 1919\u2014Belgium focused on restoring public finances and securing German reparations. Expecting these payments, Belgium borrowed heavily on international markets. In 1923, after Germany failed to meet reparations obligations, Belgium joined France in occupying the Ruhr. To cover growing deficits, the government issued debt and introduced a value-added tax. \nAfter socialists won in the 1925 elections, Albert-Edouard Janssen became finance minister and proposed devaluing the Belgian <italic>franc</italic>, raising taxes, and negotiating an international loan. As <italic>Belgian National Bank</italic> began supporting the <italic>franc</italic>, Janssen then formed a bond syndicate led by SG <italic>Belge</italic>. In October, Janssen and others signed a revolving credit agreement with BOE\u2019s Montagu Norman and <italic>Morgan</italic> and other banks in London. However, <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> declined to commit more in November. Instead, FRS\u2019 Strong proposed doubling the private credit line. The Belgian <italic>franc</italic> inflated after stabilization ended in 1927. \nIn Germany, more Christian financiers thrived. Since Wilhelm Finck built<italic> Merck Finck</italic> and co-founded <italic>Munich Reinsurance </italic>and <italic>Allian</italic>z, his son August succeeded him after WWI. Soon after August chaired the boards of both companies. While <italic>Munich Re</italic> contributed to Germany\u2019s postwar export recovery through its role in founding <italic>Hermes Kredit</italic> in 1917, <italic>Allianz</italic> established Europe\u2019s largest LIC in 1922.\nWith German <italic>mark</italic> inflation accelerating, Bavaria elected Adolf Hitler. Germans sought to hold balances in stable currencies via current accounts abroad, which <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> dominated in Britain. By 1923, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> opened a New York branch. Likewise, Cologne-based Kurt Schr\u00f6der tried again to split the Rhine but failed.<italic> </italic>As France occupied the Ruhr in 1923, MMMOF and the <italic>franc</italic> collapsed, Fritz Thyssen met Hitler, and began financing his Nazi Party. Since founding <italic>Bank voor Handel</italic> in Rotterdam in 1918, Thyssen established <italic>Union Banking Corp</italic> in New York by 1924. In 1925, Thyssen met Averell Harriman in Europe and invited him to join <italic>Union Banking</italic>\u2019s board. Additionally, several <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic> partners joined the board to manage Thyssen\u2019s American interests.\nSince the Reparations Commission appointed him as president of the committee to investigate the possibilities of the German budget in 1923,<italic> Central Trust</italic> of Illinois\u2019 Charles Dawes joined <italic>Morgan</italic>-GE\u2019s Owen Young, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Kindersley, and others to represented bondholders in brokering the <italic>Dawes Plan</italic> for German debt relief and return of the Ruhr in 1924. Per the <italic>Plan</italic>, GRS created <italic>German Land Bank</italic> (\u201cGLB\u201d) to issue notes backed by Junker farms as GRS signed over industrial bonds to reparations and allowed GRB to discount only GLB and railroad debt. While GRB could make collateral loans on GRS and city bonds, these had to mature in under a year. GRS also reduced GRB\u2019s ability to discount trade bills. \nSince 1923, Germany\u2019s Court forced GRS to write up bonds to 15% of her gold value, hiking farm taxes to balance the budget. As GRB restricted CP discounts, GRS opened wartime reorgs to general debtors. With stock price deflation fueling bankruptcies, GRS reduced the turnover tax and sought to write down pre-war public debt to 5%. In protest, German exchanges suspended. With a new Junker President, GRS increased land mortgage values to 25% and equity for long-term industrial bonds. \nWhile <italic>Dawes </italic>allowed GLB to sell bonds directly on NYSE, private credit went indirectly via Amsterdam. Warburg cousin Hans Schiff Meyer of Berlin was part of the German peace delegation in Versailles in 1919 and VP of the <italic>German Reparations Commission</italic> in Paris until 1925. Later, he joined his cousins at <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg and managed <italic>Warburg</italic> Amsterdam. During the <italic>Panic of 1923</italic>, <italic>Warburg</italic> founded <italic>Hamburger Bank</italic> to lay up a 6% gold loan to issue notes based on gold and received a <italic>dollar</italic> rediscount credit from Warburg\u2019s <italic>International Acceptance</italic>. \nAs Kindersley participated at <italic>Dawes</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London helped found <italic>International Bank of Amsterdam</italic> in early 1924 with a group of Swedish, Swiss, Dutch, German, and British banks, including <italic>Lloyd</italic>, <italic>Stockholm </italic><italic>Enskilda</italic>, and <italic>Danat</italic>. <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam\u2019s Mannheimer and <italic>Danat</italic> also opened acceptance houses in Amsterdam for Germany to indirectly tap American credit. While <italic>Lazard</italic> London formed a partnership with <italic>Behrens</italic> of Hamburg and developed a particularly close relationship with <italic>Danat</italic>\u2019s Jakob Goldsmith by 1924, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York engaged with <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>, <italic>International Acceptance</italic>, and <italic>Dillon</italic>.\nBorn in 1901 to Georges Warburg and Lucie Kaulla, Siegmund Warburg grew up linked to <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>. By the 1920s, he married Jewish Eva Philipson, whose father managed <italic>Svenska Handel</italic>, the main rival bank of the Wallenbergs. While Knut Wallenberg involved himself in politics, serving as Foreign Affairs Minister during WWI, his brother Marcus led <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>. Marcus\u2019 children linked <italic>Stockholm Enskilda.</italic> As a daughter wed an aristocratic Oppenheim in 1919, both sons trained at New York\u2019s <italic>Citi</italic> NB and <italic>Brown</italic>, Jacob went to <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> in Zurich and Marcus Jr to British <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Hambro</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Hambro</italic> and <italic>Martin</italic> heirs of London trained at <italic>Heidelbach Ickelheimer</italic>.\nMeanwhile, Siegmund\u2019s second cousin, Hamburg-born James Loeb Warburg\u2014son of Paul Warburg and Nina Loeb\u2014moved to America as an infant. Instead of joining <italic>Kuhn</italic>, he worked at <italic>Baltimore & Ohio </italic>RR from 1916 and served in America\u2019s Navy\u2019s during WWI. After graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1917, he married a descendant of Philadelphia\u2019s Quaker Shippen Willing families and joined <italic>Metropolitan</italic> NB in Washington, DC until 1919 and <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> as Assistant Cashier. As <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> invested in <italic>International Acceptance Bank </italic>in 1921 Paul Warburg, James resigned from the former to join the latter as VP.\nBy 1924, the Warburgs led American banks, including <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>International Acceptance Bank</italic>, <italic>Dillon</italic>, <italic>Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust</italic>,<italic> Marshall Field</italic>, <italic>Glore Ward</italic>, <italic>New York Trust Co</italic>, <italic>North American Co</italic>, <italic>Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co</italic>, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic>, and <italic>American International Corp</italic>, established <italic>American Continental </italic>IHC to channel capital into German industry. \nThe same year, <italic>Dillon</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and <italic>International Acceptance Bank</italic> founded <italic>US & Foreign Securities</italic> IHC to invest in Central Europe. Similar IHCs included <italic>White Weld</italic>\u2019s <italic>Overseas Securities</italic>. On the German side, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Warburg</italic>, <italic>Oppenheim </italic>Cologne, <italic>Hirschland</italic>, <italic>Levy</italic>, and <italic>Styn</italic> formed a syndicate to evaluate credit requests from German firms and coordinate with <italic>American Continental</italic>. <italic>Industrial Finance & Investment</italic> started in 1925 to further these efforts, with funds from <italic>Kleinwort</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Barclay</italic>, <italic>Fleming</italic>, <italic>Hope</italic>, BGGE, <italic>American Continental</italic>, and<italic> International Acceptance Bank</italic>. \nWith the aid of IHCs, Jewish private bankers helped finance German industry after Hugo Stinnes died in April 1924 and his <italic>Stinnes</italic> <italic>Siemens</italic> collapsed in 1925, bringing down similar HCs led by <italic>Sichel</italic>, <italic>Kahn</italic>, and others. Even <italic>Dresdner</italic> was unable to fund <italic>Krupp</italic>, which turned to <italic>Goldman</italic>-backed <italic>Hirschland</italic>. Amidst the inflationary crisis, Jakob Schapiro, a Jewish coachmaker from Odessa, gained 60% of the <italic>Rheinische Credit</italic>-banked <italic>Benz</italic> shares and 25% of <italic>Daimler</italic> shares, becoming a major stakeholder in both companies.\nWhile <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> bought <italic>Daimler</italic> shares in 1909, she declined a seat on <italic>Daimler\u2019</italic>s board, instead allowing <italic>W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic> to represent her interests. In 1917, <italic>Deutsche</italic> had an opportunity to join <italic>Daimler</italic>\u2019s board, but rejected it due to a scandal involving <italic>Daimler</italic>\u2019s war profits. Not until 1920 did <italic>Deutsche</italic> send a representative to the <italic>Daimler</italic> Supervisory Board.\nSince<italic> Ladenburg</italic> Mannheim merged with <italic>Disconto</italic> in 1905, <italic>Rheinische Credit</italic> co-founder Ladenburg kinterlinked with<italic> W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank </italic>in 1911, and <italic>Rheinische </italic>took over <italic>Ladenburg</italic>\u2019s cousin bank <italic>Hohenemser</italic> in 1919. Buying<italic> W\u00fcrttembergische </italic>in 1924, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> facilitated cooperation between <italic>Daimler</italic> and <italic>Benz</italic>. By 1926, <italic>Daimler</italic> and <italic>Benz</italic> merged, reducing Schapiro\u2019s stake to 16% and forcing him from the board soon after. \nResigning from <italic>Daimler</italic> <italic>Benz</italic>, Christian designer Ferdinand Porsche established his own automotive firm, partnering with Adolf Rosenberger to form <italic>Porsche</italic> <italic>Rosenberger</italic>. While Rosenberger\u2019s uncle Ludwig Esslinger owned gravel and lime works in Pforzheim, Ludwig\u2019s second cousin had inherited a Stuttgart bank and married a descendant of Rabbi Judah Lowe and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother in the 1860s. Likewise, Adolf Rosenberger\u2019s second cousin married a third cousin once removed of banker Martin Aufh\u00e4user\u2019s wife. (Frederich Esslinger, of unknown relation to this family, co-founded <italic>Benz</italic>.)\nOne of <italic>Disconto</italic>\u2019s stars was Christian Robert Croon Pferdmenges. Descended from Rhineland textile magnates, Pferdmenges, who joined <italic>Disconto</italic> in 1902. In 1905, he was transferred to London and then to Antwerp in 1914 to establish a new branch. After WWI, he returned to Antwerp as part of the German civil administration and continued managing the branch until 1916. That year, <italic>Disconto</italic> acquired Cologne bank <italic>Schaafthausen</italic>, of which he became head. He was elected Chair of <italic>Association of Banks & Bankers in the Rhineland & Westphalia</italic> in 1921.\nSoon after, <italic>Haniel</italic> coordinated industrial holdings with banking interests after WWI. <italic>Haniel</italic>\u2014financed by <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, <italic>Disconto</italic>,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Schaafthausen</italic> in the 19th century\u2014considered selling the family\u2019s coal mines and consulted Pferdmenges, who involved <italic>Disconto</italic>\u2019s Georg Solmssen and <italic>Ph\u00f6nix</italic>. As <italic>Haniel</italic> exchanging the coal shares for <italic>Ph\u00f6nix</italic> stock, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> relinquished the chairmanship of <italic>Ph\u00f6nix</italic> to Christian Cologne banker Otto Wolff, who controlled <italic>Rheinstahl</italic>. By late 1921 the <italic>Haniel</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, and <italic>Wolff</italic> controlled <italic>Ph\u00f6nix</italic>. \nAfter Stinnes died, GRB organized a credit syndicate for liquidity, and Jakob Goldsmith\u2019s <italic>Danat</italic> reorganized <italic>Stinnes</italic> <italic>Siemens</italic>. As <italic>Haniel</italic> doubled their <italic>Ph\u00f6nix</italic> and formed a partnership with <italic>Wolff</italic> and joined the 1925 negotiations that created <italic>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</italic> in 1926, combining <italic>Haniel</italic>,<italic> </italic><italic>Ph\u00f6nix</italic>, <italic>Rheinstahl</italic>, and <italic>Stinnes</italic><italic> </italic>enterprises\u2014with Goldsmith, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, Carl F\u00fcrstenberg of <italic>Berliner</italic>, Arthur Salomonsohn of<italic> </italic><italic>Disconto</italic>, Louis Hagen of<italic> Levy</italic>, and Anglo-American financiers <italic>International Acceptance</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Dillon</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2014which led a supra-national steel cartel across Western Europe. \nWhile Fritz Thyssen chaired <italic>Vereinigte</italic>, he secured financing for his <italic>Thyssen</italic> enterprises with his <italic>Bank voor Handel</italic> in Rotterdam and <italic>Union</italic><italic> Banking Corp</italic> in New York in collaboration with <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic> from 1925. In 1926, creditors transferred stock of <italic>Stinnes</italic>\u2019 holding company\u2019s German assets to newly formed American companies, which were split evenly between Stinnes\u2019 widow and three American firms, <italic>Newman Saunders</italic> of New Orleans, <italic>Becker</italic>, and <italic>Halsey Stuart</italic>, both of Chicago.\n<italic>International Acceptance </italic>hired Massachusetts lawyer Hugh Knowlton as VP by 1926. Since Knowlton married Christine Stanley in 1917\u2014the daughter of an Episcopalian from Connecticut who had developed the <italic>Westinghouse</italic> alternating-current system and sold his consultancy to GE\u2014her brother Harold was the president of New York\u2019s <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>and became <italic>Morgan </italic>partner by 1927. \nFrom 1927, <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>\u2019s Central European representative was Christian Bremen-born Alex Watjen. Back in 1906, a cousin of his father had participated with <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic>, <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, and GGE in forming a Berlin bank. Before his second cousin married a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister in 1916, Watjen and his cousin married daughters of Ewald Fleitmann. \nEwald and his brother Hermann had arrived to New York in the 1850s and opened an import and commission silk business. In 1866 the brothers partnered with Joseph Wharton to establish a nickel mill in Germantown, Pennsylvania. While Hermann retired in 1869, leaving management to Ewald, who soon served as VP of <italic>Citizens\u2019 Central</italic> NB and director of <italic>German Savings Bank</italic> and <italic>Germania</italic> LIC until his death in 1906, when his son and nephew took over. \nAs Germany\u2019s Court revalued railroad, city, and GRS bonds to 25% and allowable as GRB loan collateral, industry consolidated. Since the <italic>Treaty of</italic> <italic>Versailles</italic> liquidated international operations, patent sharing, and demolished military applications, Franz Mendelssohn Oppenheim merged chemical firms into his uncle Paul Mendelssohn\u2019s <italic>Agfa</italic>\u2014which innovated <italic>Zyklon B</italic> for pest control\u2014in 1920. Like other industries, industrial chemicals suffered under <italic>Dawes\u2019</italic> reparations and French occupation of the Ruhr. Attempts at labor rationalization, led to strikes. \nUnder the impetus of BASF, <italic>Bayer</italic>, <italic>Agfa</italic>, <italic>Cassella H\u00f6chst</italic>, and other chemicals companies merged to form <italic>Farben</italic> in late 1925. German co-founders included Hermann Schmitz of <italic>BASF</italic>, Carl Bosch of <italic>Bosch</italic>, Fritz Meer of<italic> Bayer</italic>, Kurt Oppenheim, Max Warburg<italic> </italic>of<italic> </italic><italic>Warburg</italic>, and Georg Schnitzler of <italic>H\u00f6chst</italic><italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic><italic>Styn</italic>, with capital from <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> and <italic>Delbr\u00fcck Schickler</italic>, and, through a Swiss HC, Americans including Edsel Ford, Charles Mitchell of <italic>Citi</italic>, Walter Teagle of <italic>OIL</italic>, and Paul Warburg. As <italic>Farben</italic> dominated German chemicals, products ranged from pest control to coal liquification for synthesized oil. By 1926, German brewers <italic>Schultheiss-Patzenhofer</italic> and  <italic>Ostwerke</italic> merged annual profits. \nAlong with <italic>Dawes</italic>, FRS eased rates for Britain to rejoin the gold standard. While withdrawing GRB discounting, GRS limited municipal treasurers access to raising capital on NYSE, squeezing PU-owning municipalities amidst coal and <italic>mark</italic> inflation. Federalizing taxes, GRS reduced spending and taxed foreign bondholders in 1926. Credit crashed as GRB decreased rates but refused to discount for banks lending on security collateral in 1927. \nSince <italic>Morgan Grenfell\u2019</italic>s Edward Grenfell married the daughter of BOE director and Chair of Far East trader <italic>Borneo Co</italic> in 1913, <italic>Borneo Co</italic> and <italic>Finlay</italic> <italic>Campbell</italic> became publicly traded in the early 1920s, and family led these firms for decades. Although withdrawing from South Africa, <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> kinterlinked with Smyth cousins and expanded tea operations from India to Kenya and Taiwan. \nIn 1918, British sugar refining heirs Ernest Tate and Charles Lyle to merge their overlapping businesses on the Thames. Sugar cube <italic>Tate</italic>, despite greater refining capacity, faced lower profitability per ton of sugar compared to syrup-focused <italic>Lyle</italic>. Motivated by the complementarity of their products, discussions led to the merger\u2019s completion after the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>. Charles Lyle became the first Chair of <italic>Tate Lyle</italic>, establishing their monopolistic position in British sugar refining. \nAnd, a year after <italic>Farben</italic>, <italic>Midland Bank</italic> funded the creation of <italic>Imperial Chemical Industries</italic><italic> </italic>by amalgamating <italic>Nobel </italic>Britian, <italic>Brunner Mond</italic> (which had secured rights to the Solvay process in Britain in 1883), <italic>United Alkali</italic><italic> </italic>(formed after a merger of Leblanc-process soda in 1905), and <italic>British Dyestuffs Corp </italic>(which was formed by the government during WWI to secure dyestuff).\nAfter WWI, <italic>Kuhn </italic>and BOE consolidated Austrian debt into <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna with <italic>International Acceptance</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>. What did not go into the new <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, went into the new <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank. </italic>An early junior hire of the bank was British brewing heir Sam Allsopp to help Austria and Hungary during post-war reconstruction. Following the merger of <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> with BOE-owned <italic>British Trade Corp</italic> in 1923 into <italic>Anglo-International Bank</italic>, Allsopp married a Smyth cousin and continued to work. One of <italic>Anglo-International Bank</italic>\u2019s subsidiaries was <italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak Bank</italic>. \nWhile British interests focused on <italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak Bank</italic>, French financial interests focused on <italic>Prague L\u00e4nderbank</italic>. Initially fully owned by BOE\u2019s <italic>Anglo-International Bank</italic>, most <italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak </italic>shares were transferred to the Czechoslovak state in 1927 with Petschek as a key local stakeholder. Despite this transfer, the British bank retained the largest shareholding, with smaller shares held by <italic>Harriman</italic> in New York and <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s founder<italic> Samuel</italic> in London. While <italic>Harriman</italic> broker founded a New York bank with capital from <italic>Samuel</italic>, Petschek invested in the newly joint-stock <italic>Thalmann</italic> Paris, which had kinterlinked with Harriman at the start of WWI.\nCompeting with <italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak Bank</italic> in the sugar sector, Vienese <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic>  sold equity to <italic>Solvay</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and <italic>Creusot</italic>\u2019s Schneider and invested in Czechoslovak <italic>Zivnostenska</italic> with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt. </italic>By 1927, <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>acquired <italic>Union Bank of Bohemia</italic> and <italic>Allgemeine </italic><italic>Verkehrsbank</italic>. Since Eugene Schneider joined <italic>\u00d6sterreichische</italic>\u2019s board in 1924, the latter merged with <italic>Union Bank of Bohemia</italic> led their Polish affiliates\u2014<italic>Bank </italic><italic>Ma</italic><italic>l</italic><italic>opolski</italic> and <italic>Union Bank of </italic><italic>Poland</italic>\u2014to merge under Chair Janusz Radziwill, whose cousin married a Wendel that year.\n<italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak</italic>\u2019s board had four British members, with at least half representing sugar interests, including <italic>British Sugar</italic> Chair Harold Carter and Donald Campbell, a Director of <italic>Grindlay</italic> and <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic>. Of a family associated with the East and West Indies trades, Donald the son of Colin Hogg Campbell married the daughter of<italic> Coutts</italic>\u2019 Senior Partner, a descendant of James Coutts\u2019 brother, in 1890. Along with becoming Chair of <italic>Finlay Campbell </italic>and joining <italic>National Provincial Bank</italic>\u2019s Board, Colin succeeded his father as Governor of <italic>London Assurance</italic>, a position he held until 1933, when he became Chair of <italic>National Provincial</italic>. By then <italic>National Provincial </italic>merged with <italic>Coutts</italic> in 1920 and <italic>G</italic><italic>rindlay</italic> in 1924. \nColin\u2019s cousin, Malcolm Hogg,<italic> </italic>who became Deputy Chair of <italic>Westminster Bank </italic>from 1922, one of Britain\u2019s five largest banks with <italic>National Provincial</italic>. Several other <italic>Westminster </italic>directors had relatives on <italic>Lloyd</italic> Bank\u2019s board, including Lord Dudley\u2019s brother-in-law CE Benson, Viscount Runciman\u2019s son, and Thomas Freeman\u2019s cousin, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Brand. \nAfter acquiring<italic> </italic><italic>Parr </italic>in 1918, <italic>Westminster</italic> merged with <italic>Beckett</italic><italic> </italic>of<italic> </italic>Leeds and York in 1921, adding Rupert Beckett as a director.  With Robert Brand as his cousin\u2019s wife\u2019s uncle, Beckett wed a Paget, whose step grandmother was a Campbell and cousin once removed married Pauline Payne Whitney at the turn of the century. Beckett\u2019s wife was related to his great-aunt, a great-grandmother of Winston Churchill-Spencer, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1924. Gaining power at <italic>Westminster</italic>, Beckett became Chair within a decade. \nLikewise, <italic>Westminster</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Robert Gascoyne-Cecil had married Elizabeth Cavendish, a cousin twice removed of Brand\u2019s wife. While Bertram Smyth was on the boards of <italic>National Provincial Bank</italic>, <italic>Samuel</italic>, and <italic>Brown Harriman</italic>, his cousins were on the boards of <italic>Hambro</italic>, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>, and dozens of other institutions.\nAlong with directing <italic>Westminster</italic>, Freeman served as MP of Hastings in 1900, Governor of Bombay in 1913, and Governor of Madras from 1919. Appointed Governor-General of Canada in 1926, he was the first to visit America on state business. Meanwhile, in Britain, <italic>Lazard</italic> London was the main investment advisor for the Anglican <italic>Central Finance Board</italic>. Kindersley and Brand supported the Church\u2019s mission. \nWhile his son soon joined the boards of the latter bank and BOE, <italic>Lazard</italic> London head Robert Kindersley\u2019s son-in-law wed a <italic>Cazenove</italic> partner by 1924. The same year, Austin Harris, whose father was Deputy Chair of <italic>Lloyd</italic> and a Director of <italic>Commercial Union Assurance</italic> and others, married Peggy Rothschild Behrens. Britain allowed <italic>Lloyd</italic> Bank to take over Britain\u2019s oldest South American bank, <italic>London & River Plate Bank</italic> of Argentina, in 1923, soon renamed <italic>Bank of London & South America</italic>.\nAfter <italic>Coutts </italic>took over <italic>Robarts Lubbock</italic> in 1914, <italic>National Provincial Bank</italic> took over<italic> Cou</italic><italic>t</italic><italic>ts</italic> by 1919. Since <italic>Smyth</italic> allied with <italic>Union Bank</italic>, she was absorbed by <italic>National Provincial Bank</italic> in 1918. <italic>Child</italic> fused into <italic>Glyn </italic>in 1924. The same year, <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic> (\u201cRBS\u201d) took over Scottish aristocratic bank <italic>Drummond</italic>. By then, in 1923, Elizabeth Lyon Bowes\u2014Abel Smyth\u2019s third great granddaughter and third great niece of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire\u2014married the younger brother of King Edward VIII.\nFor her President in 1917, <italic>Chase </italic>NB elected Eugene Rensselaer Thayer, a Boston Brahmin connected to <italic>Kidder</italic> and a third cousin once removed of John\u2019s Morgan\u2019s son-in-law William Hamilton, graduated from <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1904 and opened a brokerage firm in Boston. In 1912, he became President of <italic>Merchants</italic> NB until 1917. He resigned in 1921 but remained a director. The same year, his wife\u2019s second cousin married Charles Churchill-Spencer, 9th Duke of Marlborough.\nMeanwhile, to lift Britain out of depression and back on the gold standard, FRS kept rates low from 1924. Like BOE Governor Montague Norman was connected to <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Brown Shipley</italic>, FRS <italic>New York</italic> Governor Benjamin Strong had links <italic>Morgan</italic>. Without the other FRS District Bank Governors, Norman and Strong collaborated to stabilize the <italic>pound</italic> by inflating <italic>dollar</italic> credit and preventing gold outflows to Britain.\nIn 1922, FRS Governor William Harding\u2019s term ended as agricultural sector opposition to his deflationary policies during the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic> led President Warren Harding (no close relation) to appoint Daniel Crissinger as his successor. Harding then advised the Cuban government on a financial reorg in late 1922 and became Governor of FRS <italic>Boston</italic> from 1923\u2014as his daughter married a fellow divorcee <italic>Chase</italic> director Eugene Rensselaer Thayer\u2014until his death in 1927. Harding Governor declined <italic>League of Nations</italic>\u2019 offer in 1924 to be receiver of Hungary, but he visited unofficially and assisted the country with advice.\nIn Italy, Luigi Torre became <italic>Pisa</italic>\u2019s managing owner upon the death of his uncle Israele. Under the leadership of Torre, <italic>Pisa</italic> remained the only private bank to syndicate Italy\u2019s public debt from 1912 to WWI. <italic>Pisa</italic> also invested in <italic>Edison</italic> Italy after <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic> pulled out in 1918. From Marxist roots like <italic>Pisa</italic>\u2019s Luigi Torre, Benito Mussolini rose to power in Italy through his Fascist movement, which he founded in 1919. He combined nationalism, modernization, and mass mobilization into an ideology he called national syndicalism. As the Fascists gained power, the Socialists fragmented, creating a power vacuum that Mussolini and his supporters exploited. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Morgan </italic>promoted reconstruction. With connections to <italic>Fiat</italic>\u2019s Giovanni Agnelli, Giovanni Fummi participated in the Paris Peace talks in 1919, from where <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> hired him to expand in Italy from 1920. Along with leading Italian companies and managing Vatican investments, Fummi developed business ties with the Fascist regime, which <italic>Morgan </italic>supported due to Mussolini\u2019s stability and anti-Marxist stance.\nIn 1922, Mussolini organized a march on Rome to demand power, and the government stepped down, allowing him to become PM of Italy. Mussolini consolidated his power with the support of the military and his paramilitary group, the Blackshirts, leading to the establishment of a fascist dictatorship in Italy that abolished democracy and established one-party rule. The industrial and financial elite, including Toeplitz, Morpurgo, Luzzati, and Pisa, supported Mussolini because he protected their interests. While many of them abandoned their Jewish religion voluntarily, Edgardo Morpurgo later appointed a staunch supporter of Mussolini as Managing Director of insurer<italic> Generali</italic>. While <italic>Pisa</italic>\u2019s Luigi transformed his French lands into a cooperative to accommodate exiles in 1924, Toeplitz\u2019s <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic> partnered with SGE and other Anglo-American PUIHCs into <italic>Italian Superpower </italic>PUIHC for hydroelectricity with <italic>Edison</italic> Italy.\nAfter FRS <italic>New York</italic> Governor Strong visited <italic>Banca d\u2019Italia</italic> in 1925 to discuss stabilization of the Italian <italic>lira</italic>, FRS led BOE, BDF, GRB, and other central banks in loaning $75 million to <italic>Banca d\u2019Italia</italic> in late 1927, while <italic>Morgan </italic>extended $25 million with another $5 million from <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London at the same time.\nMeanwhile, new alliances formed. Since <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> stabilized Brazilian coffee in 1908, the operation repeated during WWI in 1917. After Britain seized London branches of German banks, Anglo-German <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Kleinwort</italic> became the main conduits for German clients as trade resumed in 1920. Along with reimbursing credits for <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, and <italic>Disconto</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> London became<italic> Deutsche</italic>\u2019s British correspondent. Bruno Schr\u00f6der also advised FRS <italic>New York</italic> on developing acceptances. \nBy 1921, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Baring</italic> formed a syndicate which issued the first post-war bond in London by a Central European country for Czechoslovakia in 1922. Using tax or commodity collateral, <italic>League of Nations</italic> acted as a trustee. Similar issues were made for Hungary, Finland, and other new countries, with the yield premiums decreasing over time as the market became more familiar with the securities.\nSince Thomas Merton\u2014a brother in-law of Katz descendant Cohen-Barent and <italic>Wagg </italic>families and cousin of the Rothschilds\u2014married Violet Sawyer in 1913, Violet\u2019s cousin, Francis Bridgeman\u2014a cousin of the Lascelles, Baring, Grenfell, and Smyth families\u2014married a granddaughter of Alex Kleinwort in 1922. By 1924, Baron Baring married Doris Harcourt, a cousin of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Grenfell and Morgan families. \nHowever, the <italic>Baring</italic>-<italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>-<italic>Rothschild</italic> syndicate faced competition. Joining <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> to grow acceptances for Indonesian sugar and Brazilian coffee, <italic>Lazard</italic> London extended credit to Poland in 1922, and considered discounting Polish acceptances in 1923. However, they declined to organize a syndicate to raise funds for Poland secured by the country\u2019s tobacco monopoly. While splitting Greek loans with <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic> partnered with <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> for investment in Finnish timber. \nAs global deflation followed the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, <italic>Banco do Brasil</italic> sought a loan in 1923, which BOE\u2019s temporary embargo on foreign loans precluded. As Brazil turned to Wall Street in 1926, <italic>Lazard</italic> London encroached on <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s relationship and led to accusations of breaching the unwritten merchant banking code. While Brazil returned to the gold standard by 1927, <italic>Lazard</italic> vetoed <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s participation in a syndicate that it formed with <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Rothschild </italic>to issue a French loan before relations were eventually restored over a cup of coffee. By 1928, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London joined <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Baring</italic> in another Brazilian capital raise in London, but only the latter two partnered with <italic>Citi</italic> NB and <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s affiliate to borrow in New York.\nWhile <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> sponsored Romania\u2019s 1913 loan, Romania refused to honor bonds held by enemy nationals, including German <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>. Despite efforts by the <italic>British Foreign Office</italic>, <italic>Exchequer</italic>, and BOE, the dispute continued. By 1925, British <italic>Vickers</italic>\u2019 lost influence in Romania to French <italic>Creusot</italic>-backed Czechoslovak steel company <italic>\u0160koda </italic>steel companies and <italic>Cop\u0219a-Mic\u0103 & Cugir Co</italic> placed management under local control. \nAs Romania sought financing in 1926, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> left the syndicate and, as Romania and France signed a treaty, <italic>Paribas</italic>, BDF, and <italic>Blair</italic> extended the loan. After Monnet joined<italic> Blair</italic> in America, he advised sovereign loans to Poland alongside <italic>Sullivan</italic>, syndicated with <italic>Morgan </italic>before <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Hambro</italic> took over. (As BOE Director Everard Hambro died in 1925, his grandson Charles joined BOE\u2019s Court by 1928.) Monnet also advised <italic>Siemens</italic>, which cooperated with Ivar Kreuger\u2019s Swedish <italic>Ericsson </italic>telephony. \nAlong with participating in foreign loans via<italic> Blair</italic>, Monnet promoted American investment in other ways. During WWI, Monnet met George Murnane of the <italic>American Red Cross</italic>. After WWI, the New York-born Catholic led <italic>New York Trust</italic>. After 1927, Murnane left <italic>New York Trust </italic>to become a partner at <italic>Lee</italic>. As <italic>Lee</italic> supported Kreuger\u2019s IHC, Monnet introduced him to government clients. Murnane also worked with <italic>Solvay</italic>, the Belgian alkaline innovator helped consolidate Austrian banks and worked with<italic> Lazard</italic>, BGGE, and <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>. \nBut bankers increasingly faced competition from non-bank advisors, including Edward Young, Edwin Kemmerer, and Kreuger. While Young\u2019s second great uncle\u2019s father was a <italic>Mallet </italic>cousin, his brother wed a Meinertzhagen cousin-in-law, a brother-in-law married a <italic>Lloyd</italic> descendant, and a nephew wed a descendant of the original Abel Smyth. After <italic>Cambridge</italic> and a few years in journalism, Young was elected to Parliament in 1915, and later, aligned with Lloyd George\u2019s faction of the Liberal Party. He became a Conservative in 1926 due to disagreements over socialism, advocating for fiscal conservatism and housing reform. \nYoung attended <italic>League of Nations</italic> assemblies and represented Britain. From 1923, he focused on fiscal reform in Poland, He designed Iraq\u2019s currency and chaired <italic>Iraq Currency Board</italic> in London from 1925 to 1930. As Chair of the Royal Commission on Indian Finance from 1925, he stabilized the <italic>rupee</italic> and drafted <italic>Indian Reserve Bank</italic>\u2019s constitution. In 1928, his East Africa mission advised on closer union of British territories. By 1931, he was the Secretary of Britain\u2019s Overseas Trade Department before shifting to corporate restructuring.\nFrom 1923, <italic>Princeton </italic>economics professor Edwin Kemmerer led monetary, banking, and fiscal reforms abroad. Starting in Colombia, he established <italic>Banco de la Rep\u00fablica</italic>\u2014a central bank resembling FRS, mirroring the way in which Colombia adopted free banking following America in the 1865\u2014and imposed minimum capital rules on banks, leading larger banks in Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn absorbed smaller regional banks, leaving Antioquia with four by 1930. By 1931, Kemmerer also advised Chile, Ecuador, Bolivia, Peru, Mexico, Guatemala, Germany, South Africa, Poland, China, and Turkey. \nHowever, banker competition increased conflicts between balanced budgets and currency stability. After Peru sought Kemmerer\u2019s assistance in managing external credit in 1926, she floated loans via <italic>Seligman</italic> and <italic>Citi</italic> in 1927 and 1928. Other countries remained direct financial protectorates. Although Nicaragua bought of 51% of the shares of <italic>Nicaraguan</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>in 1924, American bankers continued to exercise effective control.\nSince 1925, Polish reforms aimed to stabilize the financial system by monopolizing long-term credit for post-war reconstruction, while allowing banks handle short-term credit. The government targeted Jewish businesses by imposing excessive taxes and restricting access to credit through banks like <italic>Bank Polski</italic> and <italic>Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego</italic>. To counter these measures, Jewish communities, with support from <italic>American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee</italic>, established cooperative banks such as <italic>Bank Ludowy</italic>, <italic>Warsaw Discount Bank</italic>, and <italic>Spoldzielczy Bank</italic>, providing essential financial services to Jewish artisans and merchants. With investment from<italic> Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> controlled Poland\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Warsaw Discount Bank</italic>. Since Anglo-French interests took over <italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic>, they acquired <italic>Powszechny</italic>.\nHowever, Hungary\u2019s sugar focused bankers led by the Deutsch family did not survive. As Deutsch cousin Schossberger failed in 1926, <italic>Hungarian Creditbank </italic>purchased their sugar mill and retained management control. During this period, <italic>Creditbank </italic>secured the management rights for a long-term state loan with <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. With assistance from <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, <italic>Creditbank </italic>acquired the <italic>First Hungarian Bank</italic>, which had affiliations with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>. <italic>Creditbank </italic>aimed to increase its capital, and <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> expressed interest in joining the syndicate but wanted board seats. \nFollowing unsuccessful negotiations, <italic>Creditbank </italic>settled for a smaller increase in capital, which involved participation from <italic>Lazard</italic> London and existing shareholders. But by 1928, a new foreign group, including <italic>International Acceptance</italic> and <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, facilitated a further increase in capital for <italic>Creditbank</italic>. Sugar also drove investment in Latin America. Since <italic>Chase</italic> NB invested in a Dominican Republic bank, taking her over in 1926. <italic>Chase</italic> soon expanded to Cuba. After <italic>Royal Bank of Canada</italic>\u2019s branch manager Jos\u00e9 Obregon wed a daughter of Cuban\u2019s president in 1926, <italic>Chase</italic> hired him to intermediate with the Cuban government.\n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panic of 1925</italic>\nAlthough Ohio and New York split the presidency for four decades after 1870, Tennessee led the prior four. President Andrew Jackson\u2019s central figure in his circle was Judge John Overton, a frontier lawyer, speculator, and slave dealer. After a long friendship and business partnership, Overton proposed Jackson\u2019s run for governor of Tennessee in 1814. After co-founding Memphis in 1819, he managed to secure the state legislature\u2019s endorsement for Jackson as a presidential candidate. Overton\u2019s influence extended further as he formed the Nashville Committee, which successfully propelled Jackson to the Senate in 1823. In Jackson\u2019s political family, John Overton played the crucial role of consigliere.\nSince <italic>Independence</italic>, Americans limited municipal tax to protect life and property, such as police, fire protection, education, and street grading. So, cities granted franchises for private activities with stipulated rate controls. In the 1830s, high property tax revenues financed the South\u2019s first municipal boom when state banks monetized plantation mortgages. One such banker was Alex Caldwell, a plantation owner who co-founded the first Presbyterian church of Memphis before moving to Nashville. However, the collapse eroded municipal credit and fell further with the <italic>Civil War</italic>. In Memphis, despite only 5% of the city\u2019s residents owning taxable real property, the heirs of John Overton, including their in-law Judge John Lea, collectively possessed nearly 10% of the assessed real estate value.\nDuring <italic>Reconstruction</italic>, East Tennessee\u2019s mixed-race and commercial interests pushed the first Confederate state to adopt the 14th Amendment. In Tennessee, Governor Brownlow disenfranchised veterans, militarized a White and Black police force, and appointed Northerners to administer state and local affairs, but failed to recruit the land-rich Judge Lea, whose family had had sent Jackson to the White House. As the regime financed public schools and services for poor Whites and enfranchised Blacks, theft and corruption grew. \nAlso refusing Brownlow, Judge John Baxter called for enfranchisement of landed confederates in 1867. With most of the tax incidence falling on property, confederates refused to pay. Without revenue, Nashville\u2019s government floated short-term checks that soon depreciated. However, to prevent repudiation, the <italic>Bankruptcy Act of 1867</italic> (\u201cBA1867\u201d) had not covered municipalities. So, Judge Lea and other taxpayers argued municipalities were business corporations\u2014not political bodies\u2014and placed Nashville into receivership in state insolvency court. In addition, Lea convinced Brownlow to re-enfranchise <italic>Confederate</italic> veterans and Congress against military rule. \nBy 1870 Brownlow left for Congress and <italic>Reconstruction</italic> ended. Re-enfranchised <italic>Confederates</italic> overturned earlier reforms and ousted the carpetbaggers. While they re-legalized segregation and restricted state taxation with a new constitution, the carpetbag debt remained. By 1873 Memphis defaulted on her debt. The <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> struck within months, and cholera broke out of Nashville\u2019s former army depot. As citizens fled and tax defaults grew. Following neighboring states, Tennessee replaced slavery with a prisoner lease system against Black vagrants. While decreasing taxes for prisons, the system also paved roads and brought in revenues.\nAs Memphis could not compromise with inter-state bondholders, the state granted in-state creditors priority to force non-residents to compromise. Memphis\u2019 situation further deteriorated as yellow fever spread. Without compromise, the Governor disincorporated Memphis, transferring the territory into the Shelby County Tax District and appointing a receiver to administer it. As creditors petitioned Judge Baxter, he appointed a water executive as receiver to monetize and decontaminate the water supply. \nThe Lea and Baxter families also industrialized Tennessee. Coal from West Virginia to Illinois expanded the iron industry from the Midwest to the Great Lakes. Before the <italic>Civil War</italic>, textiles in Britain and New England processed Southern cotton using wheel hydro-energy but competition led them to coal and steam engines. After the war, Judge Baxter\u2019s son Jere reorganized <italic>Tennessee Coal & Iron</italic> (\u201c<italic>COALT</italic>\u201d) in 1866, linked British collieries in 1875, and acquired them in 1882. As <italic>COALT</italic> purified ore with open hearth, <italic>Baring</italic> financed Kentucky coal. Baxter\u2019s other son Nathenial was a director of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Nashville</italic>, which absorbed <italic>Mechanics</italic> NB in 1880, and in 1883, merged with <italic>Merchants</italic> NB. <italic> </italic>Similarly, Judge Lea\u2019s son served as a long-time VP of<italic> American</italic> NB, which organized in 1883.\nPolitical planters also banked other Southern states. Among Florida\u2019s earliest bankers was James Taliaferro. Born to Virginia planters descended from Emperor Charlemagne and William the Conqueror, Taliaferro\u2019s extended cousins included the Kentucky bankers <italic>Alexander</italic>. After the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Taliaferro moved to Jacksonville, Florida, and became active in lumber. In 1883, he helped establish <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Tampa</italic>. Elected to the Senate in 1889, Taliaferro soon became President of the bank until 1903, when his brother replaced him. In 1907, James\u2019 daughter married Edward Lane, a banker from Valdosta, Georgia, who had founded <italic>Atlantic</italic> NB of Jacksonville in 1903.\nUnlike the North, Tennessee and the war-ravaged, low-tax South had few defaults as they reduced state railroad-aid in the 1880s and dis-industrialized. National law, meanwhile, shaped municipal financing of utilities and banking. In choosing between the receivers, the Court rejected the sale of property held for public uses to pay municipal debts. Like impairing municipal bond obligations, the Court also forbade municipal re-incorporations.  \nAmidst railroad price discrimination against localities that had failed to stipulate such controls, the Court in  allowed states to cap rates on railroad-operated grain elevators for the public interest in 1877. Likewise, the Court deemed water supply a public interest in 1884, permitting municipally-owned enterprises in California to replace private franchises. Even as most states privatized electric utilities in the 1920s, the West coast retained significant public ownership. While <italic>Munn</italic> supported Midwestern sprawl by creating equal access to Chicago grain certificates, Henry Flagler, <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s co-founder, invested in railroads to develop Florida. \nWhile Jay Gould had limited regionalization with a low coal price strategy, his <italic>Western Union</italic> cartelized telegraphy with <italic>Morgan</italic> funds. Since <italic>Prime</italic> financed James Scrymser\u2019s <italic>International Ocean Telegraph </italic>as the first cable to Latin America in 1866, Jay Gould seized <italic>International Ocean Telegraph </italic>in 1878, leading Scrymser to turn to <italic>Morgan</italic> to form<italic> Mexican Telegraph </italic>and <italic>Central & South American Telegraph </italic>later. \nAlthough long funding sovereign, railroad, and telegraphy ventures, <italic>Morgan</italic> continued funding innovation. In 1878, Egisto Fabbri persuaded John Morgan to back Thomas Edison of Ohio in developing the phonograph and electric lightbulb with <italic>Western Union</italic>. As William Forbes and Henry Lee Higginson financed Scottish telephony pioneer, Alex Graham Bell, and gained control of his <italic>American Bell Telephone</italic> in 1879 to monopolize telegraphy patents, Edison and his British assistant, the son of a clergyman, Samuel Insull, disrupted gas PUs by selling electric equipment to central stations.\nUnlike Edison\u2019s direct current, <italic>Westinghouse</italic> alternated. As <italic>Westinghouse</italic> bought electric engineers in 1886, <italic>Siemens</italic> leased Edison\u2019s patents for Germany. From 1887, <italic>Sprague</italic> street cars spread across America. While <italic>Lee</italic>\u2019s Higginson, <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic>\u2019s Thomas Coolidge, S Endicott Peabody, and George Gardner took over electric manufacturer <italic>Thomson Houston</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s American agent, Henry Villard, worked with <italic>Morgan</italic> to take over <italic>Northern Pacific RR</italic> in 1887 and fuse Edison\u2019s patents with engineers in 1889 into <italic>Edison</italic> with funding from GGE, <italic>Siemens</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and<italic> Rockefeller</italic>. After the passage of AA1890, SSPA, and the failure of<italic> Baring</italic>, <italic>Deutsche </italic>lost confidence in Villard and recalled her loans from <italic>Edison</italic> in the fall of 1890. \nAlthough George Peabody paid British ironmasters for rails partly in railroad stock, the practice was uncommon in the 1830s. While <italic>Edison</italic> accepted PU bonds as payment, she required cash after PUs defaulted in the <italic>Panic of 1890</italic>. As Villard and <italic>Morgan</italic> merged <italic>Edison</italic>, <italic>Sprague,</italic> and other engineers into <italic>General Electric </italic>(\u201cGE\u201d), GGE left the pool in 1892. With PUs collapsing amidst the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic> and GE lent to and reorganized PUs. To appraise the value of the PUs, <italic>Morgan</italic> retained the Boston Brahmin electrical engineering consultancy <italic>Stone Webster</italic>, which was founded by a son of <italic>Kidder</italic> partner Frank Webster.\n<italic>Stone Webster</italic>\u2019s other co-founder, Charles Stone, was an extended cousin of the founder of <italic>Kidder</italic>\u2019s predecessor firm, <italic>Thayer</italic>, and of Galen Stone. After working as a financial editor, Galen joined Boston brokerage <italic>Clark Ward</italic>, where he met Adams cousin Charles Hayden, who had graduated from MIT in 1890 with a degree in mining and electrical subjects, including copper. In 1892, Stone and Hayden left to form brokerage <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>, which targeted copper investment from inception, using direct circulars to help copper develop American telephony and electricity. \nAmidst evaluating and appraising electrical properties, <italic>Stone Webster</italic>\u2019s financial officer, Cameron Forbes\u2014a grandson of John Forbes and a son of AT&T\u2019s founding president\u2014aided the firm in managing and owning electrical properties. The first property acquired was <italic>Cumberland Electric Light & Power Co</italic> of Nashville, which they bought from <italic>Morgan</italic> interests in 1894 after appraising the property by the investment bankers. \nSince John Morgan\u2019s cousin-in-law <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic>\u2019s Edward Adams was elected President of <italic>Cataract Construction</italic> to tap the hydroelectric potential of Niagara Falls in 1890, he assembled experts which led him to select <italic>Westinghouse</italic>\u2019s alternating current over GE in 1893. The same year that Adams resigned from <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic> to represent <italic>Deutsche</italic> in America and reorganized <italic>Northern Pacific </italic>RR. By 1895, GE and <italic>Westinghouse</italic> pooled patents to end the litigation in 1897.\nHenry Byllesby had worked with Edison from 1881 until leaving to invent over forty electric devices with George Westinghouse for four years. In 1891, he received a job offer from Charles Coffin, President of <italic>Thomson Houston</italic>, to oversee a Minnesota subsidiary. Over his four years in Saint-Paul, he observed that many Midwestern electric companies lacked the resources to meet customer demand, leading to financial instability and acquisitions by competitors. After <italic>Thomson Houston</italic> merged with Edison\u2019s GE, he chose not to work for Edison again. In 1895, he relocated to Oregon and became VP of GE <italic>Portland</italic>. In this role, he successfully designed, financed, and constructed four hydroelectric developments by 1899.\nPU competition was especially fierce. While a price war likewise erupted in New York in 1878, coal-based gas PUs formed a pool. With electricity, <italic>Sprague</italic>\u2019s streetcars revolutionized inter-urban transport starting by 1884. That year, <italic>OIL</italic> interests created a trust for equity stakes in inter-state urban PUs and induced them to switch from coal- to oil-based gas. (Natural gas was not a factor until 1927.) Amidst incongruous antitrust from state courts, they used <italic>Morgan</italic> financing to purchase one of Pennsylvania\u2019s 1870 HC charters and create <italic>United Gas Improvement</italic> (\u201c<italic>GAS</italic>\u201d), a PUHC. After <italic>GAS </italic>formed <italic>Equitable Gas Light Co</italic> in 1884, New York\u2019s old gas pool formed <italic>Consolidated Gas</italic>. Likewise, <italic>GAS </italic>expanded into Boston<italic> </italic>via <italic>Brookline</italic>. \nSome PU profits were thin as cities chartered public PU and contracted competing short-term private PUs. Like they did after the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Chicago spurred rate wars after the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic> by issuing new charters and building public PUs, including one to illuminate the river in 1887. As a private PU sued another for territory, Illinois\u2019 court dismissed the case to prevent monopoly. So, <italic>Morgan</italic> funded <italic>GAS\u2019</italic> acquisition of both PUs and raised prices. However, Illinois initiated dissolution in 1889. Following the <italic>Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 </italic>(\u201cAA1890\u201d), <italic>GAS</italic> surrendered their charter and continued acquisitions after restructured it into an NYSE-traded <italic>trust</italic> in 1891. While Courts restrained Illinois from forcing <italic>GAS</italic> to sell her Chicago assets, the city weaponized AA1890, chartering a phony PU, which they forced <italic>GAS</italic> to buy. \nLikewise, the local nature of PUs stimulated local magnates. During Ireland\u2019s potato famine, Anthony Brady and his family fled, soon settling in Upstate New York. At the age of 19, he opened his own tea store in Albany, New York, after previously working at the Delavan House in Albany. Over time, he expanded his tea business, establishing stores in Albany and Troy, New York, which became major players in the local tea trade. Later in his career, Brady diversified into the granite industry, acquiring significant granite quarries and undertaking specific construction projects such as sewer installation and pavement construction. \nAs <italic>Albany Gas Light Co</italic> prospered, the City Council granted a gas supply franchise to <italic>Municipal Co</italic>in 1885, with construction to start in 1886 and gas provision in 1887. Amidst political attempts to deceive the press and council members, Brady bought most of <italic>Albany Gas Light Co</italic>, and contracted to sell coke stock to <italic>Municipal </italic><italic>Co</italic>. Soon after Brady acquired PUs in Cohoes and Utica. Brady hired fellow Irish Catholic Thomas Murray as his electrical engineer, who soon developed many patents with Edison.\nMeanwhile, the invention of water-based manufactured gas threatened more expensive oil gas. In 1884, Edward Addicks arrived in Boston with water-based gas patents, establishing <italic>Bay State Gas</italic>, and monopolizing water-based gas. Without banker financing, Addicks started companies across several states to inflate stocks (\u201cstock watering\u201d), that greatly increased the value of his shares. Although Boston\u2019s aldermen had prevented competition with <italic>Bay State Gas</italic>, Boston\u2019s Mayor Matthews sought to lower gas prices, and contracted <italic>Brookine</italic> in 1893 to supply water-based gas. This contract exerted direct pressure on <italic>Bay State Gas</italic> and prompted other gas companies to reduce their pricing strategies. Amidst agitation against over-capitalization, Boston enacted stringent anti-stock watering provisions. \nWith gas resources encroaching upon Boston, Addicks aimed to secure control over PUs within <italic>GAS</italic>\u2019 territory in Brooklyn, New York. In response, <italic>GAS</italic> formed <italic>Brooklyn Union Gas Co</italic> to acquire Brooklyn gas companies. As Matthews\u2019 mayoral term ended in 1895, he became President of <italic>Bay State Gas</italic>. By 1896, <italic>GAS</italic> settled the conflict by selling <italic>Brookine </italic>to <italic>Bay State Gas</italic>. Yet, the strict anti-stock watering acts of 1894 posed significant challenges, and <italic>Bay State Gas</italic> entered receivership. As <italic>GAS</italic> gained control of <italic>Bay State Gas </italic>along with <italic>Brookine</italic>, Matthews\u2019 became legislative counsel for<italic> GAS</italic>\u2019s Whitney. \nMeanwhile, new PUs kept forming in New York City. While Russell Sage\u2019s <italic>Standard Gas Light Co</italic> obtained rights from the state legislature,<italic> Lehman</italic> and <italic>Belmont</italic> funded <italic>East River Gas</italic> from 1890, and six small operating PUs started in Queens by 1895. In 1897, <italic>Morgan</italic> helped form <italic>New Amsterdam </italic>to merge <italic>GAS\u2019</italic> <italic>Equitable Gas Light Co</italic>, <italic>East River Gas</italic>, and several other firms. The following year, Whitney and Brady partnered with <italic>Edison Brooklyn</italic> to buy two Brooklyn PUs. But the mergers were all local. \nAfter shifting states\u2019 <italic>commerce</italic> rate-setting powers to courts in 1890, the Court limited ICC\u2019s power before the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>. Uncertainty grew until 1898<italic>. </italic>With <italic>Smythe </italic>the Court cemented <italic>Munn</italic> for <italic>commerce\u2014</italic>including municipally regulated PUs<italic>\u2014</italic>allowing fair market value profits in the public interest to eliminate rate wars. However, a rate war ignited in Manhattan in 1899, involving <italic>Consolidated Gas</italic>, <italic>Standard Gas Light Co</italic>, and <italic>New Amsterdam</italic>, resulting in a significant reduction in gas prices. The rate war ended when <italic>Consolidated Gas</italic> absorbed both competitors along with the Queens PUs in 1900. Within a year, <italic>Consolidated Gas</italic> and <italic>Edison Brooklyn</italic> fused into <italic>Consolidated </italic><italic>Edison</italic>. \nLikewise, competition drove PUs to consolidate in other urban centers. Since starting in 1891 with support from New York\u2019s <italic>Edison</italic>, <italic>Edison </italic>San Francisco merged with <italic>San Francisco Gas Light Co</italic> in 1896 to form <italic>San Francisco Gas & Electric Co</italic>, which continued acquiring PUs. GE also funded entrepreneurs such as Horatio Livermore, who established a hydroelectric plant at Folsom to electrify his streetcar franchise in Sacramento.\nThere was much competition in the field. Bavarian-born Aaron Fleishhacker immigrated to America in 1845, and  traded in California and Nevada from the 1850s, establishing a business. While his son Mortimer joined his father\u2019s paper box factory and paper business around 1890 and organized <italic>Truckee River General Electric Co</italic>, <italic>American River Electric</italic><italic> Co</italic>, and <italic>City Electric Co</italic>, and <italic>Central California Traction Co</italic> by 1905, Mortimer\u2019s brother  Herbert began as a bookkeeper in 1887, became a salesman, and established paper mills in Oregon before kinterlinking with an joining <italic>London, Paris</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> & American Bank </italic>in 1907.\nParis-born Polish Prince Andr\u00e9 Poniatowski founded <italic>Standard Electric Co</italic> after marrying a sister-in-law of the son of <italic>Central Pacific RR</italic>\u2019s co-founder, William Crocker in 1894. California\u2019s greatest utility was built by Eugene Sabla, who had a similar background. The son of an import-exporter descended from nobles who fled the French Revolution, Panama City-born Sabla mined gold mines on the Yuba River north of Sacramento. \nWith Colgate family funding, Sabla founded a hydroelectric plant for his operations in 1895. The venture hired electrical engineer William Stanley, an Episcopalian from Connecticut who had developed the <italic>Westinghouse</italic> alternating-current system. (While Stanley later sold his consultancy to GE, his children kinterlinked <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic>.) Over the next decade, Sabla expanded their endeavors, constructing additional plants and forming <italic>Yuba Power Co</italic> in 1899 to also supply the Livermores.\nBy 1900, <italic>Harris</italic> helped Sabla consolidate his plants into <italic>Bay Counties Power Co</italic>. Building on this success, Sabla established <italic>California Gas & Electric Co </italic>in 1903. When the earthquake of 1904 brought devastation to San Francisco, utilities had to reorg. In the wake of this disaster, Sabla merged <italic>San Francisco Gas & Electric Co</italic> with their <italic>California Gas & Electric Co</italic>, leading to the birth of <italic>Pacific Gas & Electric Co</italic> (\u201cPG&E\u201d) in 1905. PG&E acquired Poniatowski\u2019s <italic>Standard Electric Co</italic> soon after. By 1924, PG&E acquired<italic> </italic>Fleishhacker\u2019s <italic>Great Western Power Corp</italic>.\nUrban PU consolidation continued. Since Addicks\u2019 son served as an engineer for Boston PUs, he became SVP of <italic>Consolidated Gas</italic> by 1903. But while<italic> Consolidated Gas</italic> Boston and <italic>Kidder</italic> sought to fuse eight Boston PUs in 1905, injunctions and court cases prevented them from doing so for three years, after which they decreased prices. Along with funding<italic> Consolidated Gas</italic> New Jersey to hold ferries and streetcars, <italic>Lehman</italic> consolidated Midwestern gas PUs. In Tennessee, <italic>Consolidated Gas </italic>monopolized Memphis PUs from 1902, and by 1912, <italic>GAS</italic> gained control of the of streetcars Providence, Rhode Island, and gas in Nashville. Likewise, <italic>Clark</italic> amassed gas and electric PUs in Tennessee, Maine, Oregon, Illinois, and Michigan by 1914.\nIn 1904, GE, with financial backing and strategic support from <italic>Morgan</italic>, incorporated <italic>Electrical Securities Corp</italic> in New York. The following year, GE and Sidney Mitch\u2014an Alabama-born son of a doctor and daughter of a Presbyterian preacher\u2014formed <italic>Bond & Share</italic> ( together \u201cSGE\u201d). \nTo consolidate control and finance local PUs, SGE issued bonds backed by diversified PU securities and managed operations through a pyramid structure as PUHC. SGE enabled inter-state electrification via minority equity investments, lowering capital costs for state-regulated utilities, and financed acquisitions by issuing debt and preferred shares while controlling common stock. SGE used PU securities as collateral for loans from <italic>Morgan</italic> and other bankers, but hydroelectric development remained underfunded.\nWith financing from <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>SHIP</italic>-cofounder <italic>Griscom</italic>, SGE\u2019s board included Jacob Newman as a director. A son of Jewish New Orleans private banker Isidore Newman, Jacob was President of <italic>New Orleans-Carrollton</italic> RR, <italic>Light & Power</italic>. from 1895 and joined his father\u2019s <italic>Newman</italic> in 1900.  As SGE founded <italic>Carolina Power & Light </italic>and other PUs, Newman served as President of <italic>American Cities RR & Light</italic>. Likewise, Louis Root\u2014a Christian extended cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Secretary of State Elihu Root and the Morgan family\u2014joined <italic>Newman</italic> after working at <italic>New York Security & Trust.</italic> In 1910, SGE joined a syndicate that organized <italic>American Cities</italic> as a reorg of<italic> </italic><italic>Newman</italic>\u2019s <italic>American Cities</italic>, which <italic>Griscom</italic> acquired in<italic> </italic>1914. \nWhile New York finance was dominant and GE\u2019s Charles Coffin of Massachusetts was a Quaker Mott cousin, not a Boston Brahmin, half of GE\u2019s long-term service directors from 1893 to 1910 were Brahmin, including Henry Lee Higginson, Oliver Ames, and <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic>\u2019s Thomas Coolidge. Indeed, Coolidge\u2019s niece married Higginson\u2019s nephew in 1905. Their cousins were also involved in financing other industries, such as railroads, <italic>American Bell Telephone</italic>, <italic>United Fruit</italic>, <italic>Kidder</italic>, <italic>Shawmut </italic>NB, and <italic>Lee Higginson</italic>. \nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, <italic>Kidder</italic> promoted Robert Winsor to partner in 1894. Winsor, who began as a clerk in 1880, had a mother who was the daughter of Unitarian Reverend Henry Ware, a founder of <italic>Harvard</italic> Divinity. While one of Henry Ware\u2019s sons followed in his footsteps as a reverend and divinity professor, two others pursued careers in medicine. One of them taught at <italic>Harvard</italic>, and another married Elizabeth Cabot Lee, whose brother and brother-in-law founded <italic>Lee Higginson</italic>.\nThe sons of <italic>Lee Higginson</italic> founders George Cabot Lee and Henry Lee Higginson were senior partners in the late 19th century. Since <italic>Kidder</italic> partner Frank Webster\u2019s son founded engineering consultancy <italic>Stone Webster </italic>in<italic> </italic>Boston, that firm was retained by <italic>Morgan</italic> to appraise the value of GE\u2019s PUs during the <italic>Panic of 1893. </italic>Upon Francis Peabody death in 1905, Frank Webster became Head of <italic>Kidder</italic>, although Robert Winsor made most of the day-to-day decisions. Their business focused on local connections and relationships with leaders of <italic>Merrimac Manufacturing</italic>, <italic>Massachusetts Cotton Mills</italic>, <italic>Calumet Copper Mining</italic>, and <italic>American Bell</italic>. \nBy 1900, <italic>Lee Higginson</italic> hired James Storrow, who became Chair in 1910. Storrow\u2019s Boston Brahmin grandfather was related to the Lee, Cabot, and Higginson families, and engineered the Lowell and Lawrence mills. Since his father was <italic>Bell</italic>\u2019s patent lawyer, Storrow followed his father into law after graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> Law. While his mother linked him to <italic>Morgan</italic> as Commodore Perry\u2019s great niece, Storrow had married into the Quaker Mott family, connecting him to Arizona copper magnates <italic>Phelps Dodge </italic>and <italic>Seligman</italic>\u2019s Strauss and Guggenheim in-laws.\nPreferring pre-Revolutionary Protestant British immigrants, <italic>Morgan</italic> did not share kinship or partnerships with any Jewish bank until the 1930s. And then only via Christians, without hiring Jews for decades. If any joined, they were Anglican converts, like the other diverse partners. Born to a Florentine father Russian mother, Egisto Fabbri became Anglican and married a Brit after immigrating in the 1850s before joining <italic>Morgan</italic> in 1875. Likewise, <italic>Morgan</italic> hired the native-born son of a Scotch-Irish Methodist minister, George Lamont, but he became a Presbyterian. <italic>Morgan</italic> Partner Edward Stettinius was raised Catholic, but married and became an Anglican.\nNot allowing women on the trading floor, <italic>Morgan</italic> only invited wives to the bank when it was closed on New Year\u2019s Day. Belle Costa Greene stood apart in <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s private circles. Working as a <italic>Princeton </italic>librarian since 1902, Belle met John Morgan through his nephew. From late 1905, she became the financier\u2019s personal secretary and remained the Head of <italic>Morgan </italic>Library until retiring in 1948. While Belle claimed her fark complexion came from a fictional Mendes-Costa maternal grandmother, her estranged father Richard Greener was <italic>Harvard</italic>\u2019s first Black graduate in 1870. After attending <italic>Uni of South Carolina Law </italic>and working with Booker Washington, Greener served as a Commercial Agent in Vladivostok and Bombay\u2019s Consul during Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s presidency, and later became Dean of <italic>Howard </italic>Law. \nMeanwhile, socially elite White Protestant women established <italic>United Daughters of the Confederacy</italic> (\u201cUDC\u201d) in 1894 in Nashville, Tennessee. UDC memorialized the Confederacy by erecting monuments across the South. Their significant influence was evidenced by successful lobbying efforts, such as securing substantial funding from state legislatures, including projects like the <italic>Confederate Women\u2019s Home</italic>, inaugurated in 1915. Although UDC maintained exclusivity to wives of merchants, lawyers, judges, and members of state legislatures, membership rapidly expanded to over 100,000 members by the outbreak of WWI. This movement coincided with a kind of golden age of Black banking.\nDespite some claims that the collapse of <italic>Freedman Saving & Trust </italic>destroyed Black banking, it trained many in business and capitalism.<italic> </italic>In 1887, a former slave turned preacher founded <italic>United Order of True Reformers</italic> to provide members with health and death benefits in Richmond, Virginia. However, due to a lynching incident and rumors of White plans to harm one of the <italic>Order</italic>\u2019s lodges that had entrusted its funds to a White storekeeper, the Order decided to create a bank as a secure repository. By 1888, <italic>Savings Bank of United Order of True Reformers</italic> started, supporting stores, a hotel, an elderly home, and a rural enterprise that involved cultivating and marketing agricultural products.\nOver the next two years several more Black banks started, including <italic>Capital Savings </italic>in Washington, DC, <italic>Mutual Trust Co</italic> in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and <italic>Penny </italic><italic>Savings</italic> in Birmingham, Alabama. Black banks saw a big jump in deposits at the turn of the century to serve as depositories for Black fraternal LICs, closely connected with churches, and often founded and included clergy on their boards. In Atlanta, <italic>Georgia Real Estate Loan & Trust Co</italic> and <italic>Atlanta Loan & Trust Co</italic>, started in 1890 and 1891, with the aim of providing capital to Blacks.\nBy 1897, <italic>Union Mutual </italic>LIC, an extension of a Black LIC in Alabama, established its headquarters in Atlanta as the first chartered Black LIC in the state. Over 28 Black banks across the South between 1899 to 1905, including <italic>Eureka</italic> and <italic>South End</italic> banks in Boston; <italic>Empire </italic>and <italic>Adelphia </italic>savings and loans of Cleveland and Columbus Ohio; <italic>Mutual </italic>S&L of Charleston, West Virginia; <italic>One Cent Savings </italic>in Nashville; and <italic>People\u2019s Finance</italic> with branches at Detroit, Saint-Louis, Cleveland, Kansas City, and Newark.\nAmidst this boom, the daughter of slave, mulatto Maggie Mitchell of Richmond, Virginia became one of the first women to start a bank. In the mid-1850s, Mary Prout, a free Black woman in Baltimore, founded the <italic>Saint-Luke Society</italic> at <italic>Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church</italic> to support female communal fundraising. After the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Prout welcomed men in 1867. Two years later, William Forrester, his father, and other men associated with <italic>Freedman Saving & Trust </italic>Richmond, splintered <italic>Saint-Luke Society</italic> Richmond into<italic> Independent Order of Saint-Luke</italic> (\u201cIOSL\u201d). After the <italic>Panic of 1873 </italic>brought down <italic>Freedman</italic>, Forrester started an insurance scheme in the 1880s, but faced resistance. \nAround the same time, Maggie graduated <italic>Armstrong Colored Normal School</italic> and joined her mother at IOSL as secretary in 1883, and soon married Armstead Walker, whose family owned a cement firm. Becoming IOSL\u2019s Secretary-Treasurer in 1899, founded <italic>Saint-Luke Penny Savings </italic>by 1903, which became the largest employer of Black women in white-collar positions. While Maggie Walker received little profit, America\u2019s first self-made millionairess, Sarah Breedlove did. Born to former Louisiana slaves, her brothers supported her through unstable marriages, including to a CJ Walker. Her hustle and innovative hair straightener propelled her to wealth and prominence. (These Black Walkers were unrelated to the White bankers of Saint-Louis.)\nThe South\u2019s first Black millionaire was Robert Church. Raised by his white father, Captain Charles Church, who owned Mississippi riverboats, and his mother Emmeline, a Malay princess who was captured during civil strife and sold into slavery. Church settled in Memphis, Tennessee, where he survived a gunshot during the 1866 Memphis race riot. During the 1878 yellow fever epidemic, he invested in real estate, amassing a saloon, hotel, restaurant, and extensive land. Actively engaged in politics, he served as a <italic>Republican National Convention</italic> delegate in 1900. \nAfter divorcing his wife, Church married fellow mulatto Anna Wright, who ancestors included a Kentucky colonel related to the English-born Philadelphia Quakers, wealthy Memphis plantation owners, and a Chickasaw Indian family known for their brickyard. His daughter Mary was an early Black female <italic>Oberlin</italic> graduate before engaging in activism, co-founding <italic>National Association of Colored Women</italic> and advocating for women\u2019s rights alongside Susan Anthony. In 1891, she married Robert Terrell, a graduate of <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Howard</italic> Law, who was appointed chief of a UST auditing division and became a DC municipal judge.\nSome Blacks benefited from the coal inflation before the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, including RB Hudson in Selma, Alabama. As Congress extended LA1889 federal mineral oversight to the Oklahoma <italic>Territories</italic> coal and oil in 1898, Blacks seized opportunities in the Creek Nation in the vicinity of Tulsa, owning nearly all the land for 40 miles along a railway line around Muscogee. Notably, Patsie Mcintosh owning the largest real estate in the area, and Black-owned banks started in the region by 1902, and Birmingham, Alabama, by 1905. Black investors soon funded streetcars from Jacksonville through Nashville to Little Rock. \nWilliam DuBois became the first Black to earn a PhD from <italic>Harvard</italic> after graduating from the Black <italic>Fisk Uni</italic> of Tennessee and studying race relations in Berlin. While he taught at several universities, DuBois did not enter finance. Instead, DuBois advocated for a Black elite, the \u2018talented tenth\u2019, which the Rockefellers funded initially with <italic>General Education Board</italic> of 1902 and, subsequently, <italic>Rockefeller Foundation </italic>of 1914. On the other hand, Booker Washington emphasizing the need for investment in Black industrial education and entrepreneurship. From 1900, his books, speeches, fundraisers, and <italic>National Negro Business League</italic>, showcased <italic>Tuskegee Institute\u2019</italic>s achievements to secure funding from John Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, <italic>Clark</italic>, John Morgan, <italic>Seligman</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Schiff and Warburg, and other industrialists. \nSince Booker Washington<italic> </italic>founded <italic>National Negro Business League</italic>, he promoted many business enterprises using politics rather than economics. One of these was for <italic>New York League</italic> delegate Philip Payton\u2019s <italic>Afro-American Realty Co</italic> in Harlem in 1903. While Harlem became a center of cultural for Blacks, Black banks and other businesses could not compete with Jews and other Whites. \nWashington also promoted Black-owned <italic>North Carolina Mutual Insurance</italic> in Durham, where other Black businesses included <italic>Mechanics & Farmers Bank</italic>, <italic>Bankers Fire Insurance Co</italic>, and <italic>National Negro Finance Corp</italic>. Moreover, Washington promoted Mississippi\u2019s self-segregated Mound Bayou, whose co-founders Isaiah Montgomery and Charles Banks became<italic> League</italic> officers and active in the Republican Party. Mound Bayou featured farms and businesses such as drugstores, restaurants, real estate companies, professional offices, post office and railroad station, along with two gins, two sawmills, an ice plant, a brick factory, a telephone exchange, and an electric power plant. In 1904, Banks<italic> </italic>founded <italic>Mound Bayou </italic>SB. Soon after, Isaiah\u2019s brother Thornton sold his Dakota lands to join Bayou, establishing <italic>Mound Bayou Loan & Investment</italic> with Banks to protect against White intrusion. \nMound Bayou\u2019s Montgomery and Banks forged ties with Delta\u2019s wealthiest Black, Wayne Cox. Graduating <italic>Alcorn College</italic> in 1884, Cox moved to Indianola, Mississippi, with a population of two thousand, with over half the residents were Black. There, he started a school for Blacks and bought extensive Delta land at reduced rates and sold parcels for large profits. His political ties with the Republican party facilitated his wife Minnie\u2019s appointment as postmistress in 1902. As Whites a circulate a petition for her to reign, President Theodore Roosevelt intervened. By 1904, Cox founded <italic>Delta Penny Savings </italic>and became President. The bank earned the distinction of being the sole black bank globally with guaranteed deposits, becoming the second largest Black-owned bank soon after.\nOther Black banks soon opened in the state. By 1905, John Webb of the <italic>Colored Woodmen</italic>, a regional Black fraternal insurance society, helped organize <italic>Peoples Penny Savings </italic>in Yazoo City, Mississippi, to be led by President Reverend Henry King and Cashier Albert Banks (of unclear relation to Charles). Like pawnshops, <italic>Peoples Penny </italic>allowed sharecroppers and small farmers with limited traditional collateral, to use guns as collateral for short-term loans. Several months later, prominent local Black leaders in Natchez established <italic>Bluff City Savings</italic>, which specialized in small, short-term loans, collateralized with livestock and farm equipment. Additionally, the bank extended larger loans for mortgages on homes, farms, and churches. By 1906, Wayne Cox helped organize <italic>Penny Savings </italic>of Columbus. Likewise, Robert Church founded <italic>Solvent</italic> <italic>Savings & Trust</italic> in Memphis, the first black-owned bank in the city. \nIn contrast to older cities like Savannah and Augusta, Atlanta\u2019s Black elite, known as the \u2018mulatto aristocracy,\u2019 predominantly emerged from a mixed-race house-servant class. Alonzo Herndon, rising from enslaved fieldwork, attained wealth through entrepreneurship. By 1902, his all-Black run barbershop catered exclusively to wealthy White men. Herndon\u2019s marriage to Adrienne McNeil, a member of Atlanta\u2019s mulatto aristocracy, marked his social elevation within the city\u2019s elite circles. A year after Herndon founded <italic>Atlanta Mutual </italic>LIC<italic> </italic>in 1905, a race riot swept through the city, fostering Black business consolidation. \nAs <italic>Atlanta State Savings </italic>became Atlanta\u2019s first Black-owned bank in 1909, Heman Perry arrived with a dream to form a competitive Black LIC. Born in Texas to a former Georgia slave, Perry joined a cotton factory at 16, but sold life insurance in his spare time from finding salaried employment in too slow. After moving to New York around the turn of the century, he sold insurance and multiplied stock wealth before losing it all. As Perry arrive in 1908, he banked at <italic>Atlanta State Savings </italic>while struggling to raise equity for a LIC<italic>.</italic>\nLikewise, the \u2018talented tenth\u2019 thrived in medicine too. Born to sharecroppers in Tillman, Mississippi, Joseph Walker graduated <italic>Alcorn College</italic> in 1903 and <italic>Meharry Medical College</italic> in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1906, before establishing a medical practice in Indianola. Like Cox and his wife, Walker faced racial discrimination as Democrat Governor James Vardaman sought to end Black education and return them to the fields. Despite these obstacles, Walker continued to provide medical care to the community. As Cox joined Charles Banks, and others to start the first Black legal reserve LIC, <italic>Mississippi Beneficial</italic> LIC in Indianola by 1908, he unsuccessfully tried to recruit Walker as President. Elsewhere, Black doctors accomplished even more.\nBorn to prominent Little Rock, Arkansas, educators, George Ish graduated <italic>Yale</italic>, like his brother, and then interned at<italic> Freedmen\u2019</italic>s<italic> Hospital </italic>in Washington, DC, and graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> Medical by 1909. Returning to Little Rock, he became a surgeon and founding <italic>United Friends Hospital</italic>, <italic>JE Bush Memorial Hospital</italic>, and <italic>McRae Memorial Tuberculosis Sanatorium</italic> in Arkansas for Black patients. Despite the racial segregation of the time, Ish worked at White hospitals in Little Rock. \nUnlike most American Blacks, the Dibbles migrated to South Carolina as merchants of royal lineage, and kinterlinked with Bonds Conway, who sold ginger beer and carpentry skills until buying his freedom from slavery in 1793. After buying property, Conway became one of Charleston\u2019s earliest Black storeowners. But decades later in 1860, only 197 out of Charleston\u2019s 8,038 Blacks were free. \nBefore the Dibbles grew the business into the South\u2019s largest grocer, Eugene Dibble Sr married his Vaughan cousin in 1888, who maintained the trans-Atlantic trade with cousins that returned to Nigeria, where a Michael Vaughan of Lagos began banking in 1920. And Eugene Dibble Jr graduated <italic>Howard</italic> Medical in 1920 to join <italic>Tuskegee Institute\u2019s John Memorial Hospital</italic> as an assistant. After joining <italic>Virginia Hospital</italic>, he returned to lead <italic>John Memorial Hospital</italic> as medical director, and then <italic>Virginia Hospital</italic>. In 1926, he married the daughter of MIT\u2019s first Black graduate, Robert Taylor, who was born a slave in North Carolina and went on to manage real estate in Tuskegee for<italic> Goldman</italic> and <italic>Sears</italic> cousin Julius Rosenwald and others. \nMeanwhile, White Southern doctors expanded in banking. The son of one of Kentucky\u2019s most extensive pre-<italic>Civil War</italic> plantation owners, Thomas Helm was born in 1859 and graduated from <italic>Lincoln Uni</italic> and <italic>Uni of Louisville</italic> to become a doctor by 1885. Three years later, he married Nellie Blakey, the daughter of a Logan County local politician and leading farmer. Helm actively participated in politics as a Democrat, serving as a federal pension examiner from 1896 to 1900. \nWhile <italic>Davison Bank</italic> was organized in Auburn, by 1880, Helm initiated the joint-stock <italic>Bank of Auburn</italic> in 1905 with the help of his political in-laws and served as its first president. He resigned after 1910 when he established a hospital in Bowling Green and became a council member of that city while also owning substantial real estate, including <italic>Morehead Hotel</italic> and a modern brick residence. Also in Bowling Green, he became President of <italic>Warren</italic> NB for two years until its consolidation with <italic>American</italic> NB, and served on the board of directors of <italic>Citizens</italic> NB.\nSoutherners also advanced national law. The Presbyterian grandson of an Irish barrister and political Indiana lawyer, Algernon Sullivan represented Southern business interests in New York before the <italic>Civil War</italic>. Despite blackballing by the <italic>New York Bar Association</italic>, the progressive sponsored the first Black lawyer to be admitted to the <italic>New York Bar</italic>. When his Southern clients immigrated north and requested his services, Sullivan and his bookkeeper, William Cromwell, established <italic>Sullivan Cromwell </italic>(\u201c<italic>Sullivan</italic>\u201d) by 1879. \nOne of <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s hires, Tennessee-born Waddill Catchings was connected to Southern elites, with cousin-in-laws including the Campbell family, American President Thomas Jefferson, Texas President Sam Houston, and Tennessee Judge John Overton. His great-grandfather, William Fly, had amassed slave wealth in Tennessee and Mississippi before relocating to Texas, where Catchings\u2019 cousin twice removed, Ashley Fly was a prominent doctor and became Galveston\u2019s mayor around the turn of the century. \nGraduating from <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law by 1904, Catchings joined <italic>Sullivan</italic> and became involved in restructurings after the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>. His notable achievement came in overseeing the successful emergence of New York City\u2019s only steel mill, <italic>Milliken</italic>, from bankruptcy in 1909. Following this, in 1910, Catchings was appointed receiver for <italic>Central Foundry</italic>, where he facilitated its operations amidst financial challenges and eventually assumed the role of president.\nAt the time, Alabama\u2019s growing steel industry required electricity. Throughout the 19th century, Congress financed dam construction by enacting individual acts for each project. Despite the Tennessee River Valley\u2019s potential, bills since the 1820s failed, and the Valley remained underdeveloped. Similarly, in 1903 and 1912, Presidents Roosevelt and Taft vetoed bills granting <italic>Alabama Power </italic>access to sell hydroelectric power and nitrogen fixation indefinitely and consigned canal fees to UST. But as domestic securities markets for such projects were underdeveloped, <italic>Alabama Power </italic>tapped British capital. Finally, in 1916, the Court allowed <italic>Alabama Power </italic>to expropriate private property in the public interest. The region\u2019s economy evolved.\nOut-of-towners helped industrialize Georgia. Since 1865, when a Tennessee Unionist founded <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>, the inaugural NB of the former Confederacy. However, state regulations confined banks to city limits, leading to a proliferation of banks in Atlanta during the resurgence of Georgia in the early 20th century. \nWhile Colonel Robert Maddox\u2014whose extended cousins from Kentucky engaged with <italic>Hargadine McKittrick Dry Goods</italic> of Saint-Louis, Missouri\u2014cofounded a planters\u2019 warehouse using tobacco and cotton as collateral and private bank, <italic>Maddox Rucker</italic> in 1879, <italic>Citizens & Southern Bank, of Savannah</italic> and <italic>Lowry</italic> started in 1887 and 1888, and a New Orleans Confederate captain became mayor and co-founded <italic>American Trust</italic> SB in 1880, becoming President in 1890. In 1896, a Mississippian established <italic>Third</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>, prompting <italic>American Trust </italic>SB\u2019s transition to a federal charter, ultimately becoming <italic>Fourth</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>.\nDuring the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, Alabama\u2019s coal king Henry DeBardeleben seized control of Jere Baxter\u2019s <italic>COALT</italic>. By 1895, Baxter\u2019s niece married Atlanta banker Maddox. Although Baxter built a depot to sell his steel, L&N refused service, and he failed along with John Gates\u2019 pools in 1896. After Gates bought Jere\u2019s property and kept him as manager. By 1902, Jere Baxter joined the state legislature to fight L&N to link his depot in 1903 but died within a year.. After <italic>Maddox Rucker</italic> reorganized as <italic>American</italic> NB in 1908, Maddox served as mayor of Atlanta for several years.\nDeBardeleben, meanwhile, banked with William Harding. An extended cousin of Levi Morton and Newton St John, William Harding was unrelated to future President Warren Harding. Born in Greene County, Alabama, Harding began his banking career at the Tuskaloosa bank <italic>Fitts</italic> following graduation from <italic>Uni of Alabama</italic> in 1881. In 1886, he became Assistant Cashier at <italic>Berney</italic> NB in Birmingham and was promoted to Cashier in 1894, managing payrolls for <italic>DeBardeleben Coal & Iron Co</italic> and <italic>Central Georgia</italic> RR. A year after he wed a tobacco Duke cousin, Harding became VP of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Birmingham</italic> in 1896 and President soon after. He also served as a Director for <italic>Birmingham Railway Light & Power Co</italic> and <italic>Bessemer Coal, Iron, & Land Co</italic>.\nAlabama-born Joel Hurt studied engineering at <italic>Uni of Georgia</italic> before established <italic>Atlanta Home Insurance Co</italic> in 1882 and <italic>East Atlanta Land Co</italic> in 1886, developing <italic>Inman Park</italic> in honor of Samuel Inman, opening Edgewood Avenue, and erecting <italic>Equitable Building</italic>. The same year, Hurt joined others to charter <italic>Atlanta & Edgewood St </italic>RR (\u201cAES\u201d), transitioning Atlanta from mule-drawn transportation to steam-power as the city\u2019s first electric streetcar line. \nTo preside over AES from 1893, Hurt installed his brother-in-law, Ernest Woodruff. While his father had moved to Georgia from Connecticut before the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Ernest married the daughter of another Northerner, who founded <italic>Winship Foundry</italic>. Buying bankrupt convict-labored coal mines and furnaces on the Tennessee border to service <italic>COALT</italic> in 1895, Hurt co-founded <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic> and became President.\nThe corporate activity required legal advice. After Alex King of South Carolina and Jack Spalding of Kentucky arrived in Atlanta, they formed law firm <italic>King Spalding</italic> in 1885 to advise railroads. Patrick Calhoun joined as a partner in 1887. A grandson of John Calhoun, Patrick left in 1896 to consolidate street railways in Pittsburgh, Saint-Louis, and San Francisco via <italic>Maryland Trust</italic> <italic>Co</italic> and <italic>Brown </italic>of Baltimore and New York.\nWhile Methodist minister and Judge Walter Colquitt served as a Georgia Congressman and Senator until his death in 1855, his son Alfred served as a major in the <italic>Mexican War</italic>, Confederate Major General during the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Governor of Georgia, and finally Senator from 1883 until his death in 1894. In 1891, Alfred\u2019s daughter married new law school graduate Preston Arkwright. As Arkwright joined the family law firm, he represented Henry Atkinson. A Massachusetts-born descendant of Puritans, Atkinson graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1884, and moved to Atlanta in 1886 to trade cotton for Inman. Becoming VP of <italic>Home Loan & Banking Co</italic> in 1889, Atkinson co-founded <italic>Southern Banking & Trust Co</italic> and took over <italic>Georgia Electric Light</italic> in 1891.\nBy 1897, Atkinson\u2019s low bid gained <italic>Collins Park & Belt</italic> RR, the sole streetcar line not part of AES. Likewise, Atkinson pursued franchises on streets running parallel to AES\u2019 profitable lines. As the pro-competitive city council granted these duplicate franchises, Hurt offered to sell AES to the city for municipal ownership of both streetcar companies in 1901. However, Atkinson fought via the law, elections, and the media using <italic>King Spalding</italic>. As Thomas Coolidge of Boston\u2019s GE-affiliated <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic> funded Atkinson\u2019s purchase of AES in 1902, they merged into <italic>Georgia</italic> RR & <italic>Power Co</italic>, and bought <italic>Atlanta Gas Light Co</italic> by 1903.\nAs Joel Hurt resigned from streetcars, he yielded <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic>\u2019s presidency to his brother-in-law Ernest Woodruff by 1904. Woodruff soon organized and reorganized <italic>Atlantic Ice & Coal Co</italic>, <italic>Atlantic Steel Co</italic>, <italic>Continental Gin Co </italic>(formerly <italic>Winship Foundry</italic>), and others. Meanwhile, Ernest\u2019s son Robert studied under Asa Candler in Sunday school. Together Candler and the Woodruffs developed Atlanta into a commercial center. After <italic>Coca Cola</italic> started as a medicinal tonic using cocaine in Atlanta in 1885, Candler bought the unprofitable business in 1888. Amidst international anti-opium sentiment, Candler eliminated cocaine and medicinal claims, and invested in advertising from 1905.\nUnder Atkinson\u2019s leadership, <italic>Georgia</italic> RR <italic>& Electric Co</italic> grew substantially. He developed the Tallulah Falls water-power project and an extensive power transmission network covering the northern half of the state. Atkinson\u2019s earlier involvement in sawmill and railroad properties in South Georgia prompted him to build the <italic>Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic</italic> RR. Despite the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic> hindering some plans, the railroad, along with <italic>Brunswick Steamship Co</italic> and <italic>Tampa Northern</italic> RR, contributed to significant regional development.\nAfter consolidating the deposit business of <italic>Atlanta Trust</italic>, <italic>Southern Banking & Trust Co</italic> combined deposit business underwent a merger into <italic>Third</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>, with Atkinson as VP. Despite his resignation in 1909, Atkinson remained a director of <italic>Third</italic> NB. Atkinson continued <italic>Southern Banking</italic>\u2019s trust business along with a land title business, rebranded as <italic>Title Guarantee & Trust Co</italic>. Taking the helm as president, Atkinson attracted Eastern capital to, contributing to the financing Atlanta real estate.\nUnlike older and larger banks, <italic>Solvent</italic> of Memphis survived the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic> as Robert Church placed sacks of money in the bank\u2019s windows. Likewise, <italic>Solvent</italic> survived an embezzlement scandal by the Cashier, and grew under Robert Church\u2019s son, Cashier Robert Church Jr. Jr had studied at <italic>Oberlin</italic> and <italic>Packard School of Business</italic> in New York before interning for two years on Wall Street. Other Black banks suffered. Despite promotion by Booker Washington<italic> </italic>in 1903, Philip Payton\u2019s <italic>Afro-American Realty Co</italic> of Harlem collapsed amidst the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>. \nStill, new Black banks continued forming. Since the Atlanta\u2019s race riot of 1906, the first Black-run bank was organized in 1909, and by 1913, <italic>Atlanta State Savings </italic>became Georgia\u2019s first chartered Black bank. While over 100 SBs failed annually in Mississippi since the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, new starts continued to register net increases. After Mississippi\u2019s governor underscored the absence of safeguards for consumers in 1912, the state legislature could not agree on bank examiner selection.\nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, Virginia insurance regulators sought to enforce banking rules in 1910, focused their attention on <italic>True Reformers</italic> due to suspicions of mismanagement and corruption. That year, Commissioner Button ousted the organization\u2019s president, and later, audited <italic>True Reformers Bank</italic>, causing it to become insolvent and placed under receivership. Empowered with expanded authority and a progressive agenda, extended audits to all 14 Black-owned banks in the state. His actions, including placing <italic>People\u2019s Southern One Cent Savings </italic>under receivership, revealed their intricate interconnections and the potential dire consequences for customers and property owners. He employed surprise audits to uncover various issues in the banks, from minor discrepancies to limited access to modern business methods, depressed property values in segregated areas, and difficulties in obtaining credit. \nSince Oklahoma started bank deposit insurance amidst the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, the Court held them constitutional in 1911. As FA1913 deleted NB deposit insurance provisions from early drafts, other agricultural and Democratic states adopted SB schemes. But more banks failed. In Mississippi, as loan defaults and alleged theft by Cashier Banks deteriorated Yazoo City\u2019s <italic>Peoples Penny Savings</italic>\u2019 situation, White authorities utilized the criminal courts rather than established banking regulations to gain control of the bank in 1913. \nIn the process of arresting, charging, and trying President Reverend King and Cashier Banks, they took possession of the bank assets and loans. By October, the large, White-owned <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Natchez</italic> failed, leading depositors to run from nearby banks. As a precaution, the Black-owned <italic>Bluff City Savings </italic>temporarily closed. Despite holding $50,000 in assets and following conservative lending practices, White authorities advocated for the bank\u2019s closure and asset liquidation amidst an embezzlement case involving the assistant cashier. By early 1914, Mississippi established a Board of Examiners and a deposit guarantee system.\nBy then, persuaded by Booker Washington, Julius Rosenwald funded <italic>Mound Bayou Oil Mill</italic>, which started in 1913. However, of the peak number of 12 Black banks in Mississippi in 1910, only a third remained open as Mississippi implemented the 1914 banking law. That year, bank examiner James Love began audits focusing on Black banks. As <italic>Mound Bayou</italic> SB, <italic>Penny Savings </italic>of Columbus, and <italic>Southern Bank </italic>of Jackson closed after several audits, only <italic>Delta Penny Savings </italic>of Indianola remained after Love repeatedly scrutinized its operations.\nAmidst Love\u2019s efforts to impose stringent requirements, <italic>Mound Bayou</italic> SB reorganized and opened in 1915. However, as troubles arose with <italic>Mound Bayou Oil Mill</italic>\u2019s White lessee BB Harvey, the mill suspended operations in 1915. As Bayou leaders rejected offers from <italic>Proctor Gamble</italic> to maintain their identity as a Black-run community, <italic>Mound Bayou Oil Mill</italic> converted into a dancehall. \nIn Tennessee, <italic>Solvent</italic>\u2019s success attracted another Black bank, <italic>Fraternal</italic> <italic>Savings &</italic> <italic>Trust</italic> in 1910 under the leadership Reverend Jay Scott. Both banks expanded rapidly and invested heavily in Black business as Memphis grew through WWI. These two Black-owned and operated Memphis banks played a crucial role in launching and supporting Black businesses, with <italic>Solvent</italic> soon becoming the nation\u2019s fourth largest. \nAfter Robert Church of Memphis died in 1912, his son became President of <italic>Solvent</italic> but distanced himself from operations. Instead, he turned his focus to civil rights and politics, becoming a delegate to multiple Republican National Conventions and establishing the first branch of NAACP in Tennessee. Church Jr also founded the <italic>Lincoln League</italic>, which organized voter registration drives and voting schools for Black voters. He forged a relationship with Democratic politician EH Crump, who provided tax exemptions for Church\u2019s real estate holdings in exchange for votes, which protected Church\u2019s technically delinquent properties.\nRacism also struck White bank owners. At the twilight of the steamboat era ended L&N\u2019s competition with Nashville\u2019s <italic>Ryman Lines</italic>, Tom Ryman died in 1904. However, Ryman\u2019s daughters married two Coggins brothers. Born in Cherokee County, Georgia, Augustus Coggins inherited his father\u2019s livery stable and gold mine. At 25, Coggins was elected as Cherokee County\u2019s sheriff in 1893 and before marrying Daisy Ryman. Expanding his family\u2019s livery stable, Coggins partnered with his brother to purchase horses and mules for resale in Atlanta and the southeast. With his 350-acre <italic>Crescent Farm</italic> and adjoining properties, Coggins employed 75 Black farmhands overseeing livestock breeding and crop cultivation. By 1913, Coggins became President of the new <italic>Bank of Cherokee</italic>.\nAround that time, \u2018sundown towns\u2019 emerged in the South, barring Blacks from staying past sundown, allowing them only as visitors. In 1910, farmers employing Black laborers received warnings to dismiss them. Many chose to retain their Black workforce, including Coggins. However, in late 1915, the <italic>Ku Klux Klan </italic>set <italic>Crescent Farm</italic> and other farms ablaze. With two barns, one filled with crops and the other housing mules and horses, being lost the <italic>Cherokee Advance</italic> described it as the destruction of Georgia\u2019s largest corn crop ever. Still, Coggins\u2019 <italic>Crescent Farm</italic> and <italic>Bank of Cherokee </italic>survived.\nAfter her key patent expired in 1893, <italic>Bell</italic> lowered prices to grow market share. During the 1900 HC boom, <italic>Morgan</italic> reorged into <italic>American Telephone & Telegraph</italic> (\u201cAT&T\u201d), gaining control from <italic>Lee</italic>. One of her operating companies, operated by Alex Caldwell\u2019s son James out of Nashville, competed with independents while spreading across the South. After buying the <italic>Tennessean</italic> newspaper in 1906, Judge Lea\u2019s grandson, Luke, became Tennessee\u2019s Senator in 1911. Citing Wilson, he lobbied ICC to investigate L&N. \nThe Court, however, supported L&N. Lea\u2019s career ended by 1916. While Congress took control of railroads in 1920, Nashville lost her grain privileges. Like Jere Baxter\u2019s competition against the monopolistic L&N, Luke sponsored a competitor to Caldwell\u2019s multi-state telephony operator in 1905. As states increasingly limited competition, Tennessee had rejected Lea\u2019s proposal and, later, Nashville\u2019s request for a municipal competitor. For universal access, those who can afford must cross-subsidize. So, by keeping Nashville\u2019s government from gaining a tax alternative, Caldwell could afford to sell to rural areas at a loss.\nIn 1910, AT&T\u2019s new management broadened her telephony monopoly to telegraphy by acquiring <italic>Western Union</italic>. And after pushing Caldwell to invest in long-distance service, AT&T forcefully gained control of his system using sub-HCs. While Taft expanded ICC\u2019s scope to include telecommunications, Roosevelt opposed his antitrust policy and split the party ticket by charging against him in the election of 1912. \nAgainst the Taft and Roosevelt monopoly supervision debate, Professor Wilson campaigned to prohibit big business and regulate competition instead. To avoid ICC investigations under the new administration, AT&T sold off <italic>Western Union</italic> and agreed not to monopolize local telephony. But she called for Roosevelt-style regulation to limit competition. Still, private PUs raised less in the capital markets than industrials and much less than railroads.\nWhile Germany\u2019s GGE invested in entire PUs from 1910, GE only held minority interests through SGE. (Similarly, the Boston Brahmin electrical engineering consultancy, <italic>Stone Webster</italic>\u2014related to <italic>Kidder\u2019s</italic> CEO Webster and banked by the Boston Brahmin-led <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic>\u2014emulated GE\u2019s SGE from 1909 buying minority interests in clients with a Maine-domiciled HC.) Insull pursued a different route. After GE bought out Edison in 1892, Insull acquired one of Chicago\u2019s 36 PUs with funding from Marshall Field. By 1902, Insull funded his former associate Henry Byllesby to open an engineering firm in Chicago, <italic>Byllesby</italic>, which similarly acquired struggling Midwestern PUs.\nIn spite of UST, Insull and other PUs interlocked directorates with a politically-active Chicago NB, which failed and brought down several banks in 1906. Although Chicago legalized consolidated in 1896, only in 1906 did he buy out the city\u2019s crony PU, consolidating them down to two. As rates fell, Chicago became one of the world\u2019s most electrified cities. Since leaving <italic>Harris Halsey</italic> Chicago (<italic>Halsey</italic> <italic>Stuart </italic>from 1911)<italic> </italic>financed Insull\u2019s PUs after the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>. From 1910, PUs became the main business of <italic>Halsey</italic> <italic>Stuart </italic>and <italic>Harris</italic>. \nBut the nascent city of Chicago offered opportunity. Of free-Black mulatto descent, Adelphia Binga married a barber, traded food across the country, and rented Detroit tenements. By 1908, her son, Jesse opened <italic>Binga</italic> private bank in Chicago. Four years later, Jesse married \u2018Mushmouth\u2019 Johnson\u2019s sister. Chicago\u2019s \u2018Number Banker King\u2019, Mushmouth managed illegal gambling operations by paying off officials before dying in 1907.\nBy 1913, Insull secured fair state rate regulation from Illinois and other states to replace municipal regulation of electric PU rates to sell rural electricity cheaper. As President of the <italic>National Electric Light Assn,</italic> Insull lobbied President Wilson to nationalize coal and stabilize prices upon entry into WWI. From regulation to business, came Howard Hopson. After <italic>JG White</italic> bought out <italic>Speyer</italic> from <italic>Associated</italic> PUHC in 1912, Hopson regulated <italic>Associated</italic> as New York PU Commissioner. He left in 1915 to consult <italic>JG </italic>and others on PUs. In 1916, Henry Byllesby formed <italic>Northern States </italic>PUHC. WWI strained their capabilities, but after the war, it thrived and acquired many more utility companies in the Upper Midwest.\nCongress supplemented AA1890 with AA1914, requiring FRS approval for NB directorate interlocks and forbidding inter-state HCs, except for regulated industries without direct competition: SBs outside of large cities and PUs. For these, most common law trusts had incorporated in New York and Delaware. While agricultural processors issued FRS-discountable CP, PUs and industrials issued longer-dated CP, stocks, and bonds. Unlike older central banks, FA1913 intentionally forbade FRS from discounting private securities or loans secured by them. HCs issued and pledged their own and operating company securities for credit. \nSBs could make larger collateral loans. Although NBs could lend up to 10% of their assets to one party, the limit was 25% for New York SBs\u2019 collateral loans. After AA1914 privileged SBs,  enticed SB conversions by allowing NBs outside New York, Chicago, and Saint-Louis to make real estate loans. This growth required PUs. The wartime coal shortage led steel and other captives to buy market electricity. By buying electricity from PUs, heavy industry cross-subsidized consumers and farms for universal access. \nAlthough UST had taxed PUHCs twice since TA1909 by taxing dividends, the drastically higher TA1917 compounded the burden. Congress did expand tax-free reorgs with TA1917 to compromise TA1916\u2019s unearned gains and indefinite deferral. UST subsequently required HCs to pay income tax on consolidated returns. Finally, TA1918 exempted intercorporate dividends from controlled subsidiaries to the parent from taxation, stimulating dividend payouts from operating companies to HCs and further acquisitions. Capital markets revived after WWI ended in late 1918, increasing TA1916\u2019s tax liabilities. High tax bracket investors fueled a municipal tax-exempt debt boom, funding roads, PUs, and land development subsides. \nSince the Court further allowed municipalities to operate fuel yards in addition to PUs, municipal debt grew with their scope and incomes. Although PUs spread nationally, the South accounted for an outsized portion as Southern municipal financing improved. Tax-exempt municipal debt markets grew with new income taxes and the automotive revolution, which slowly shifted municipal taxation from property to gasoline sales taxes.<italic> </italic>In Tennessee, James Caldwell\u2019s son Rogers established <italic>Caldwell </italic>to parlay these taxes into Southern municipal bonds as an issuer and market marker. Before distributing these bonds to inter-state LICs and SBs affiliates for sale in branches, <italic>Caldwell </italic>pledged them to access state funds deposited at NBs controlled by Luke Lea and James Caldwell. \nWhile Tennessee\u2019s 1877 law granting local creditors priority added security may have disincentivized industrial development, the Court supported it, and investors in <italic>Caldwell </italic>inter-state HC likely benefited. During the high tax and inflation of WWI, the cumulative pressures were most challenging for PUs that could not set prices without legislative acts. To pay debt interest, PUs issued shorter-term debt as rates grew. \nPUHCs\u2014predominantly bank-sponsored\u2014restructured defaulting intra-urban PUs via receiverships into state-regulated monopolies. Since the 1870s, common law courts allowed railroads to issue receivers\u2019 certificates to pay off dissenting creditors and finance working capital in voluntary equity receiverships. After BA1898, BHCs dominated receiverships. During the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, the Court confirmed that non-railroad creditors could appoint <italic>Wabash</italic> receivers, and New Jersey allowed non-railroad corporations to reorg using receiverships. As with railroads, banks oversaw these reorgs and issued receivers\u2019 certificates. While railroad reorgs before the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic> eliminated shareholders, the new receiverships issued reorg warrants.\nMeanwhile, Insull integrated PUs horizontally with gas and vertically with customers\u2014electric streetcars and ice manufacturing\u2014to diversify cash flows, decrease coal use, and pay fair wages unlike collieries. BHCs and PUs increasingly took over streetcars after the Court legalized non-railroad <italic>Wabash</italic>-style BHC receiverships for New York City\u2019s streetcar HC and other non-railroads in 1907. \nHowever, WWI coal famines pushed business away from PU-powered streetcar to cheap oil powered cars, trucks, and jitneys. After Congress nationalized railroads during WWI, she reprivatized<italic> </italic>them with IA1920. Having prevented return increases during WWI inflation, this act cartelized the sector for steady returns with ICC reorg and merger regulation. Since Congress excluded streetcars from IA1920\u2019s railroad cartels, streetcars remained in receivership for longer. Without municipal subsidies, Insull battled Chicago to consolidate urban transport.\nCheap oil and the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic> drove the car sector. During the consolidations of 1900, patent holders banded to form patent pool <italic>CAR</italic> in 1903. With <italic>Rockefeller</italic> financing, the new motor company <italic>Ford </italic>refused to join and sued <italic>CAR</italic>. As the older firms failed during the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, <italic>CAR </italic>members revolted to lower licensing fees. So, one of the<italic> CAR</italic> members, William Durant, whose uncles led <italic>Genesee County Savings </italic>and <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Flint</italic>, formed <italic>General Motor </italic>(\u201cGM\u201d) with financing from <italic>Lee Higginso</italic>n\u2019s James Storrow to consolidate <italic>CAR</italic>. \nIn 1910, as <italic>Morgan</italic> refused to finance GM on legal advice from Francis Stetson of future-<italic>Davis Polk</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic> supported <italic>CAR</italic>, Durant yielded control of GM\u2019s board to Storrow and fellow Mott-in-law <italic>Seligman</italic>\u2019s Strauss, joined by <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Central Trust</italic>. While Durant backed Louis Chevrolet in forming <italic>Chevrolet Motor</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic> joined Eugene Meyer in a bond syndicate for <italic>US Motor</italic>. However, poor subscriptions pushed <italic>US Motor </italic>into receivership and <italic>CAR</italic> fell apart after a court held it against the public interest. Still, <italic>Chevrolet </italic>grew. By 1914, Pierre DuPont acquired GM with financing from Michigan iron affiliated <italic>Chatham Phenix </italic>NB and rehired Durant. \nFrom 1913, <italic>Ford </italic>developed assembly lines based on meatpackers, accelerating the industry\u2019s growth until the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic> led GM to bypass banks and sell secured CP directly. Still, automobiles grew faster than other industries to transform <italic>commerce</italic>, public finance, and energy demand. But competition was fierce among <italic>Willys-Overland</italic>\u2014affiliated with <italic>Wilson Foundry & Machine</italic>, <italic>Curtiss Aeroplane & Motor</italic>, and <italic>Moline Plow Co </italic>while also relying on short-term financing\u2014to <italic>Auburn</italic> and <italic>Duesenberg</italic>, which gambler Errett Cord soon acquired. Alongside the manufacturers, Czech Jew John Hertz founded the <italic>Yellow Cab </italic>in Chicago in 1915 and became its president in 1922. By 1924, he fused New York\u2019s <italic>5</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> Av Co</italic> and <italic>Chicago Coach </italic>to form <italic>Omnibus Corp of America</italic>, and initiated <italic>Hertz Drive-Ur-Self</italic> in 1924 before selling both to GM by 1925.\nSince the British Admiralty established a network of wireless stations across the Empire for instant global communication with British vessels amidst-scandal pre-WWI Anglo-German arms race, <italic>Marconi</italic> spread. With <italic>Franci-Swiss Bank</italic> was an early investor, <italic>Marconi</italic> entered France in 1917, MOF intervened to block <italic>Marconi</italic>\u2019s attempt to establish a monopoly. Instead, <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Paris formed <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Wireless</italic>, becoming the leading French provider of international radio communications. It expanded its network through specialized subsidiaries and established alliances with American interests in 1919. <italic>Paribas</italic> supported an electricity project inspired by the German model in 1919, resulting in the creation of electric businesses in France, in partnership with British and Belgian companies, with developments continuing into the 1920s.\nAs aircraft patent disputes hindered the war effort, Assistant Navy Secretary Franklin Delano Roosevelt (\u201cFDR\u201d) convinced them to form a pool for cross-license patents. As Congress nationalized AT&T, GE, and others, the coalition innovated radios. As Congress reprivatized industry and resumed patents after WWI, GE sought to sell the tech to British <italic>Marconi </italic>in 1919. But FDR\u2019s national security concerns led GE and AT&T to cross-license patents and share manufacturing in a JV, <italic>Radio Corp of America</italic> (\u201cRCA\u201d). While AT&T kept the telephony market, the agreement gave GE control of RCA. As Congress made AT&T a monopoly in 1921, AT&T shares became America\u2019s most distributed stock, followed by Insull\u2019s PUs, which sold customers preferred shares to thwart public ownership. \nFDR\u2019s extended cousin, Owen Young\u2014a fifth great-grandson of a Roosevelt\u2014graduated from <italic>Saint-Lawrence Uni</italic> in 1894 and <italic>Boston Uni</italic> Law in 1896. Specializing in corporate law in Boston, he joined GE in 1913 as general counsel and later VP. He founded RCA, which he soon headed along with GE. Since FDR\u2019s cousin William Roosevelt developed <italic>Mexican Telegraph </italic>and <italic>Central & South American Telegraph</italic> and merged into <italic>All America Cables</italic>, he became Chair, with Vanderbilt, Higginson, and <italic>OIL</italic> cousin John Auchincloss of <italic>Davis Polk</italic> included as board directors. By 1920, Congress lost confidence in <italic>Commercial Cable Co</italic>\u2019s Mackay family after learning that they were effectively controlled by Pender\u2019s British consortium.<italic> </italic>\nAround the same time, the Behn brothers formed <italic>International Telephone & Telegraph </italic>(\u201cIT&T\u201d) in Cuba as <italic>Citi</italic> promoted the bond issue in 1921. Born in the Danish Virgin Islands to a Danish father and a French mother, the Behns became American citizens by 1917 as America bought the Virgin Islands. By 1921, one brother married a cousin of Edward Berwind, President of <italic>Berwind White</italic>. Since the turn of the century, Berwind worked with <italic>Morgan</italic> to reorg <italic>Metropolitan </italic>streetcar, coal mining properties and became one of the world\u2019s largest individual owners. Along with related coal directorships with railroads, steamships, docks, and lumber, banks, and insurers, he monopolized New York\u2019s steamship coal. \nSince 1911, Berwind\u2019s sister wed Henry Harjes, Senior Partner of <italic>Morgan Harjes</italic>. Still, <italic>Morgan </italic>did not finance the Behns in the wake of the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>. Harjes\u2019s father had co-founded <italic>Morgan </italic>with John Morgan and Anthony Drexel and led <italic>Morgan Harjes</italic> in Paris. Likewise, a nephew of Harjes\u2019s deceased first wife, William Graves served as secretary of <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> Paris, where he established the Overseas Division during WWI.\nHowever, Harjes died in a polo accident in 1926 before his sons could take over the firm, and the name changed to <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris since Harjes\u2019 sons were too young and French law required named partners to practice. So, John Carter, a descendent of Emperor Charlemagne and cousin twice removed of Confederate General Robert Lee, became Senior Partner at <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>Paris. While his niece married Anthony Drexel\u2019s granddaughter in 1917, his son, Bernard Carter, had joined the firm in 1924 after time with his cousin-in-laws at <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> Grenfell</italic>, contributing to the firm\u2019s work in securing loans for European governments and businesses during post-WWI reconstruction.\nCarter led alongside Nelson Jay. A graduate of <italic>Knox College</italic>, Jay joined <italic>Milwaukee Trust</italic> in 1907, became bond department manager in 1910, and VP of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Milwaukee </italic>the following year. In 1915, he moved to <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> in New York as bond department manager and became VP in 1916. During WWI, he worked under General Charles Dawes as assistant general purchasing agent. In 1919, he joined <italic>Morgan Harjes</italic> in Paris and became a partner. He was appointed American trustee for the <italic>Dawes </italic><italic>Plan</italic> loan in 1924.\nWith CP markets frozen, PUs and other corporations shifted to bonds and bank loans from CP. Unlike Federal bank and\u2014after IA1920\u2014railroad receiverships, bankers led PU receiverships. While failures spiked, defaults were low as state commissioners allowed rate hikes to offset capital expenses. After Memphis squeezed her PU into receivership by preventing increases, Tennessee then took over municipal rate setting, and SGE reorganized the PU. Because of the panic, corporations shifted from short-term CP to capital markets. Likewise, banks replaced risky unsecured CP with NYSE-secured collateral loans. And as UST reduced debt, banks purchased municipal debt. \nAfter the Court held banks labile for <italic>over</italic>certification in 1913, NYSE mutualized clearing in 1920. While central clearing reduced settlement risk, funds shifted from clearing to collateralized margin loans. UST furthered this credit efficiency by allowing NBs to branch within city limits. With the run from FRS-discounted farm credit, Chicago\u2014the bastion of such credit\u2014switched to stocks and bonds. \nAfter decades of debate about federal development of the Tennessee River Valley,<italic> ALUM</italic> acquired land for hydroelectricity from 1914.<italic> </italic>The debate grew as German submarines made fertilizer imports risky. Congress refused to compensate private PUs, forcing donations. While peacetime elections halted the effort, the <italic>Waterpower Act of 1920</italic> replaced the necessity for Congressional authorization of each dam by creating the <italic>Federal Power Commission </italic>(\u201cFPC\u201d) to finance dams and hydroelectric plants and protected public and private rights with licenses for fifty years. By 1921, <italic>Alabama Power </italic>and Henry Ford sought to dam the Tennessee River to industrialize the South. But as Congress debated the project, coal inflation remained. \nFacing the prospect of losing large electricity consumers after WWII, <italic>Alabama Power</italic> sought ways to retain the state\u2019s industrial base. Collaborating with Henry Atkinson of <italic>Georgia</italic> RR & <italic>Power Co</italic>, they conceptualized the idea of \u2018coal by wire\u2019, transmitting power from Alabama to Georgia. The initiative led to a five-state transmission grid by 1921, benefiting the Southeast during a drought. <italic>Alabama Power</italic>\u2019s strategic leasing of surplus capacity from a coal plant further enhanced regional power coordination.\nBlack-owned bank assets soared after the <italic>Panic of 1914</italic>. Although <italic>Penny Savings</italic> of Birmingham, Alabama, was the largest Black-owned bank in the country, her founder and leader, Reverand William Pettiford, died in 1914. While <italic>Penny </italic>merged with <italic>Prudential Savings</italic>, another Black-owned bank, the new executive was unable to access liquidity from larger banks like Pettiford had done. After<italic> Penny Prudential</italic> failed in 1915, Birmingham had no Black-owned bank for over four decades.\nAfter receiving a charter to found <italic>Standard</italic> LIC in Atlanta, Heman Perry recruited Robert Church of Memphis, FC Brown of Philadelphia\u2019s<italic> Brown Stevens</italic>, and Booker Washington\u2019s secretary Emmett Scott among directors. By 1917, he created the affiliated <italic>Service Co</italic> HC, which controlled eleven operating subsidiaries with an estimated worth of about $11 million, including construction, realty, engineering, and printing ventures that employed over 2,500 people for building a public high school and residences. As Perry\u2019s conglomerate added<italic> Citizens Trust Bank </italic>in 1918, his affiliates removed funds from <italic>Atlanta Savings</italic>, forcing the latter to close.  \nWhile physician Joseph Walker became involved in Booker Washington\u2019s <italic>National Negro Business League</italic> and served as a delegate in the Republican Convention from 1916, he refused to take over <italic>Mississippi Beneficial</italic> LIC in Indianola until Cox died in 1917.\nAs <italic>Atlanta Mutual </italic>LIC thrived, Wilson Lovett, an agent out of Louisville, spearheaded Kentucky\u2019s inaugural Black-owned bank, <italic>First Standard Bank</italic> in 1920. Since William Wright founded <italic>Mammoth</italic> LIC in 1917, later forming <italic>Mutual Savings & Realty Association</italic>, which evolved into <italic>American Mutual Savings</italic>, Wilson Lovett\u2019s <italic>First Standard Bank</italic> diversified with <italic>Domestic Mutual</italic> LIC, property, realty companies, and loan associations.\nDespite the New York Banking Commissioner\u2019s efforts in 1922, Northern Black banks opened only in Chicago and Philadelphia. Although there were more Black banks in Virginia and the South, the Chicago and Philadelphia were much larger. Richard Wright founded the North\u2019s first Black bank. Growing up a fatherless slave, Wright gained freedom in 1863, and attended a missionary school before serving as a major and the first Black paymaster in the <italic>Spanish-American War</italic>. Guided by Booker Washington\u2019s ideas of self-help and industrial education, Wright co-founder <italic>National Negro Business League</italic>, newspapers, and then <italic>Citizens & Southern </italic>private bank of Philadelphia with his children in 1920. While his positioning his bank as a community bank, he also became involved in the real estate business in association with <italic>Brown Stevens</italic>. \nChicago saw a significant increase in its Black population following WWI, due to the restrictive <italic>Immigration Act of 1924 </italic>and the Great Migration of Southern Blacks. This resulted in a growth of Black-owned businesses, including Jesse Binga\u2019s private bank. While Binga\u2019s private bank prospered, the failure of another in 1919 led Illinois to outlaw them in 1921. As <italic>Liberty</italic> LIC\u2014co-founded by Earl Dickerson\u2014became the first Black LIC in the North, Binga reorged his bank as <italic>Binga</italic> SB, which grew quickly. \nConcurrently, Anthony Overton reorged the failed <italic>Woodford</italic> SB into <italic>Douglass</italic> NB, the first Black-owned NB. Of unknown relation to the White Judge Overton, Overton was born in Louisiana and his father briefly served in the Louisiana Legislature. With a law degree from <italic>Uni of Kansas</italic>, Overton practiced law and entered the cosmetic industry. In 1911, he moved to Chicago and formed <italic>Douglass</italic> NB in 1922, <italic>Great Northern Realty Co</italic> in 1924, and <italic>Victory</italic> LIC, which expanded to eight states by 1925 and became the first Black LIC in New York State by 1927. With the help of Samuel Insull, Binga and Overton developed Chicago\u2019s South Side. Along with finance, PUs benefited Chicago. From 1921, Insull reorged his PUHC into a Delaware corporation to buy inter-state HC, with <italic>Halsey</italic> <italic>Stuart </italic>instead of <italic>Morgan</italic>. With control of <italic>Associated</italic>, Hopson invested in PUs from New York to the Philippines. \nAs the Court forbade UST from taxing stock dividends as income in 1920,  created unconsolidated returns. So, HCs sought to wholly control the subsidiary to gain consolidated tax benefits and issued preferred equity to avoid ownership dilution. To attain this benefit and earn a total return on reinvested capital from state commissioners, PUHCs increasingly paid preferred equity dividends in stock. \nWhile stockholder sales of these stocks were taxable, they could monetize the shares tax-free via collateral loans. HCs generally acquired equity in operating companies using their shares as a currency, but large HCs issued securities to pay in cash. While UST did not tax HC debt, HC debt investors\u2019 claims to operating assets were junior relative to the subsidiary\u2019s unsecured creditors. Despite HC debt\u2019s low seniority, default risk decreased with market power, with little remaining for AT&T. \nAfter IA1920\u2019s <italic>Railroad Labor Board</italic> raised wages in 1920, the Court declared war-time price controls unconstitutional in 1921, and RHCs sought wages cuts. Riots against Blacks broke out in seven cities during 1919\u2019s inflation, but the worst struck in May, in the \u201c<italic>Black Metropolis</italic>\u201d of Tulsa, Oklahoma, the \u201c<italic>Oil Capital of the World.</italic>\u201d The state barred deflationary drilling after the massacre. By October, coal militias set off a class war against White coalers as federal troops occupied West Virginia. \nAs FRS Banks sold UST debt for profit, FRS coordinate transactions via the <italic>Open-Market Operations Committee</italic>. When a commission labeled coal a PU, Congress empowered ICC to distribute coal equitably. As the <italic>Labor Board</italic> reduced coal wages and sparked inter-state strikes in 1922, the Court held unions suable, and that <italic>LABOR</italic> violated AA1890 in 1925. As Northern collieries hiked wages, mining shifted to the South\u2019s un-unionized Black and immigrant labor. \nBy then, New York financiers linked the South to the nation. Although born in Georgia, William McAdoo\u2019s family had strong Tennessee roots, and he clerked with the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals there in 1882. He was admitted to the bar in 1885 and practiced law in Chattanooga until 1892, after which he moved to New York and formed a law partnership. In 1902, he became President of <italic>Hudson & Manhattan</italic> RR, overseeing the completion of the first tunnel under the Hudson River. Appointed Secretary of UST by President Wilson in 1913, McAdoo was instrumental in establishing FRS. For this reason, Wilson thought it imprudent to allow the widower McAdoo to resign when he married Wilson\u2019s daughter in 1914.\nAfter his wife\u2019s second cousin married Alabama coal magnate Henry DeBardelben\u2019s granddaughter in 1912, President Wilson appointed William Harding to the Board of FRS in 1914 and Governor in 1916. From 1918, Harding was also General Manager of <italic>War Finance Corp </italic>(\u201cWFC\u201d). As Harding\u2019s FRS Governor term ended in 1922, agricultural sector opposition to his deflationary policies during the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic> led President Warren Harding (no close relation) to appoint Daniel Crissinger as his successor. Harding then advised the Cuban government on financial matters in late 1922 and became Governor of FRS <italic>Boston</italic> from 1923\u2014as his daughter married a fellow divorcee <italic>Chase</italic> director Eugene Rensselaer Thayer\u2014until his death in 1927.\nDuring WWI, Waddill Catchings served in <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s<italic> Export </italic>department in procuring and transporting essential resources for the Allied forces. Following his tenure at <italic>Morgan</italic>, Catchings assumed the presidency of <italic>Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron</italic> of Birmingham, Alabama, to supply products for the war effort. Alongside his <italic>Harvard</italic> classmate William Foster, Catchings co-founded the <italic>Pollak Foundation for Economic Research</italic> to advance economic. As Henry Goldman retired during WWI for supporting Germany,<italic> Goldman Lehman</italic> hired Catchings in 1918 as her second non-Jewish partner. By 1925, Catchings hired Albert Gordon, a <italic>Harvard</italic> Business educated Catholic whose father became wealthy supplying the British Army leather in WWI.\nOther mixed religion firms also combined Northern and Southern connections. Since <italic>Newman </italic>co-founded SGE and organized <italic>American Cities</italic>, the latter defaulted in the <italic>Panic of 1920. </italic>So, SGE and <italic>Newman </italic>formed <italic>National </italic>PUHC in New Jersey to acquire <italic>American Cities</italic> PUHC and other PUs in late 1921. Meanwhile, the Jewish <italic>Newman</italic> promoted Louis Root to partner and added fellow Christian Paul Saunders. \nBorn into a family of Southern planters and lawyers, Saunders led <italic>Commercial Bank & Trust</italic> of Laurel, Mississippi, to 1911, <italic>Mortgage Securities</italic> in New Orleans to 1915, and <italic>Commercial Trust & Savings </italic>of New Orleans from 1917, when he became a director of the New Orleans branch of FRS <italic>Atlanta</italic>, which he chaired from the year he joined <italic>Newman.</italic> In 1922, <italic>Newman</italic> dissolved to form <italic>Newman Saunders</italic>, with Newman as President and Saunders and Root as VPs, and soon invested PUs in Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, and elsewhere. \nThe same year, <italic>Newman Saunders</italic> hired Powell Groner, an Episcopalian extended cousin of North Carolina\u2019s tobacco Duke family, who had studied law and became involved with <italic>Kansas City</italic> RR. Soon after, Newman\u2019s daughter kinterlinked with <italic>Gerstle Sunstein</italic> brokers of Philadelphia and his niece married a<italic> Gimbel </italic>heir, connecting <italic>Newman Saunders</italic> to the Seligman and Guggenheim families.\nWhen <italic>Caldwell</italic> formed in 1917, she was <italic>Kidder</italic>\u2019s only Southern correspondent, and<italic> Kidder</italic> New York was her only correspondent. Soon, <italic>Caldwell</italic> acquired over 50 banks spanning from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ohio River, and established branches in New York, Chicago, and over 20 other cities. But he had competition. \nAfter graduating <italic>DePauw Uni</italic> in 1916, Howard Sheperd joined <italic>Citi</italic>, with an interruption by WWI. Howard\u2019s father had modernized egg filling in Indiana before transferring his business to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and becoming America\u2019s most widely known man in the paper industry. In 1918, <italic>Harris Forbes</italic> hired Atlanta-born Eugene Black, whose father graduated <italic>Uni of Georgia</italic> and practiced law and represented <italic>Southern</italic> RR, while serving as a Baptist deacon. Jr\u2019s maternal grandfather was Henry Grady, who founded the <italic>Atlanta Herald</italic>. Graduating from <italic>Uni of Georgia</italic>, Jr served as an ensign during WWI.\nIn 1920, <italic>Chemical</italic> NB hired new graduates, including Tennessee-born Nathaniel Baxter Jackson from <italic>Vanderbilt Uni</italic>\u2014unrelated to President Jackson, but a nephew of Robert Maddox and great-nephew of Jere Baxter\u2014and Thomas Helm\u2019s son, Kentucky-born Harold Helm from <italic>Princeton</italic>. While Jackson became Assistant Cashier in 1920, he was promoted VP in 1923, and Helm became Assistant Cashier. Likewise, <italic>Morgan </italic>hired Tennessee-born Longstreet Hinton of <italic>Williams College</italic> in 1923, a year after hiring Henry Davison Jr\u2014whose deceased father Henry Pomeroy Davison had been a <italic>Morgan</italic> and wife was a Lee Peabody\u2014, and Russell Leffingwell, former <italic>Cravath</italic> lawyer and UST Assistant Secretary under President Wilson. \nLikewise, <italic>Hargadine McKittrick Dry Goods</italic> heir Thomas McKittrick of Saint-Louis, Missouri, graduated from <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Saint-Louis Uni </italic>Law. After time with the family firm, he briefly worked at <italic>Saint-Louis Union Trust</italic> in 1914 and then <italic>Citi</italic> NB in New York and Genoa. Following WWI, he joined <italic>Lee Higginson</italic> in New York in 1919 and became a partner in London from 1922 as he married a cousin of Germano-American brokerage<italic> Knauth Nachod Kuhne</italic>, which was hobbled by WWI and filed for bankruptcy soon after. In London, McKittrick joined William Granet, whom <italic>Lee</italic> hired in 1919. The son of a Genese banker, Granet led English railroads and married a sister-in-law of the Greys.\nWhile <italic>Walker</italic>\u2019s George Walker of Saint-Louis advised <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Export </italic>department during WWI, Samuel Bush oversaw Armaments and then Facilities Division to speed up national industrial activity. By 1920, Walker became President of <italic>Harriman</italic> and his daughter wed Bush\u2019s son Prescott. Likewise, <italic>Walker</italic> co-founder was a son of Thomas West, who had traded cotton in Mobile, Alabama, before organizing <italic>Saint-Louis Trust </italic>in 1889. The latter merged with <italic>Union Trust </italic>to form <italic>Saint-Louis Union Trust</italic>, where he became President while also directing <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Saint-Louis</italic>.\nSince 1917\u2014when the Rockefellers gained control of <italic>COALB </italic>from <italic>PENN</italic> and Baltimore banks and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul replaced <italic>COALB</italic>\u2019s one non-reelected retiring director\u2014an heir of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Stillman Rockefellers married the daughter of bag manufacturer and <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Saint-Louis</italic> director Benjamin Gratz, a Christian descendant of Kentucky Jewish coal industrial Benjamin Gratz, in 1923.\nThe same day in 1923, John Morgan\u2019s grandson Henry Morgan graduated joined <italic>Morgan</italic>, and married the daughter of Boston Brahmin CF Adams, a descendent of two presidents and director of AT&T and multiple banks. By 1924, Henry\u2019s brother, kinterlinked with mutual funds as his Converse sister-in-law married Boston Brahmin Paul Cabot, who founded America\u2019s first mutual fund trust, <italic>State Street Investment Corp</italic>, within <italic>State Street Trust</italic>,<italic> </italic>presided over by <italic>Russell</italic> descendant Allan Forbes. Since deceased <italic>Morgan </italic>Partner Henry Pomeroy Davison\u2019s son Henry Jr married a Lee Peabody and joined <italic>Morgan</italic>, another son married Anne Stillman, daughter of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s former president, in 1924. The following year, Anne\u2019s cousin James Stillman Rockefeller married Nancy Carnegie.\nIn 1923, <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic> acquired <italic>International Trust Co</italic>, growing employees to 1,657, from 152 in 1908, and affiliating with <italic>International Acceptance Bank</italic> after hosting a Warburg. A grandson of kerosene pioneer Samuel Downer, Allan Pope joined <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic>\u2019s security affiliate after WWI and became manager of the Boston office. From 1921 to 1925, he was VP in charge of the New York office, then a director until 1928. He became President in 1928. \nPope\u2019s brother Bayard began his career as a salesman and then joined electrical securities firm <italic>Blodget</italic>, becoming a Partner in 1918. In 1926, <italic>Blodget</italic> merged with the securities division of <italic>Stone Webster</italic> to form <italic>Stone Webster Blodget</italic> under the leadership of Pope, who also became VP of <italic>Stone Webster</italic>. That year, <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic> reorganized <italic>Stone Webster</italic>\u2019s PUHC from 1909 into a Delaware HC, following Insull\u2019s example. In 1926, <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic><italic> </italic>hired the Kentucky army veteran John Montgomery, an extended <italic>Coutts</italic> Forbes cousin who had married Virginia Lee, Confederate General Robert Lee\u2019s grand-niece and <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris\u2019 John Carter\u2019s third cousin. \nBefore John Morgan\u2019s grandson Pierpont Morgan Hamilton wed a <italic>Blair</italic> daughter in 1922, a third cousin once removed of John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife, William Huntington Perkins\u2014not a relative of Thomas-Handasyd Perkins\u2014led <italic>Bank of America</italic> in New York since 1890 and merged with <italic>Franklin Trust Co</italic> in 1920 and later absorbed <italic>Atlantic</italic> NB around 12 months prior to his retirement in 1921. \nAfter Brooklyn Jewish banker Nathan Jonas bought <italic>Bank of America</italic> and organized <italic>Financial & Industrial Securities</italic> BHC to hold <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> and ither interests in 1925. Since his Jewish parents fled D\u00fcsseldorf during the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic> and settled in the South, Alabama-born Jonas relocated to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 1869. Entering banking as an errand boy in 1881, he assumed the presidency of <italic>Citizens Trust Co</italic> by 1905. After <italic>Citizens Trust Co</italic> merged with <italic>Manufacturers </italic>NB<italic> of Brooklyn </italic>in 1914, the bank changed her name to <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic>. \nUnlike in Europe, Protestants did monopolize banking, politics, or electricity in the Irish stronghold of New England. In the late 1840s, Irish Catholic Patrick Kennedy arrived in Boston during the potato famines, worked as a cooper, married Bridget Murphy, and had children before dying of cholera in 1858. That year, Patrick Kennedy was born. His mother supported the family as he left school to work on Boston docks. After buying saloons in the 1880s, Patrick Kennedy helped form <italic>Columbia Trust Co</italic> in East Boston in 1895, of which he became VP, and later helped organize <italic>Sumner Savings</italic>. Alongside his banking roles, Kennedy served multiple terms as a state legislator and becoming a prominent voice in the city\u2019s Democratic Party.\nIn 1888, Patrick\u2019s son Joseph was born. Starting an apprentice at <italic>Columbia Trust</italic> in 1912, Joseph became a SB examiner per his manager\u2019s advice. The experience gave him insider information into other banks. When a downtown Boston bank threatened a takeover of <italic>Columbia Trust</italic>, Joseph raised funds to retain one of the city\u2019s few Irish banks and became its President by 1914. That year he married the daughter of Boston Mayor John Fitzgerald, who had an interest in investment bank <italic>Hayden Stone </italic>through shipping<italic> </italic>company <italic>Atlantic Gulf</italic>. By 1917, Joseph Kennedy joined the board of New England\u2019s PU, <italic>Massachusetts Electric</italic>, and supervised <italic>Bethlehem</italic>\u2019s shipyard during WWI, where he worked with Assistant Navy Secretary FDR.\nAfter WWII, Joseph Kennedy left the shipyard in 1919. Through his wife and <italic>Massachusetts Electric</italic>\u2019s board, he had built a connection with Galen Stone of <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>, which he soon joined. Mayor James Curley also promised Stone business in return for hiring Kennedy. Stone, who was on the boards of 22 companies, including <italic>Pond Coal Co</italic>, taught Kennedy to profit from insider information. Kennedy bought 15,000 shares of <italic>Pond Coal</italic> at $16 each before public knowledge of its acquisition by Henry Ford and sold them at $45 each. Though not illegal then, this was unethical. After Stone retired 1922, Kennedy refocused on New York.\nWhile Congress expanded tax-free reorgs with TA1921 for businesses to readjust to the deflation, the Court limited the scope to close loopholes. Still, the Court allowed HCs to claim tax savings from consolidated filing as income in 1923. As after-tax yield advantages fell for municipal PUs, banks competed in inter-urban PUs. While GE\u2019s PUHC was the largest, banks joined and fueled suburban investment as PU securities outgrew industrials and railroads. Although <italic>Caldwell </italic>supported Ford\u2019s venture, Southern PU industrialists convinced Congress to block the deal in late 1924. \nAs FRS eased policy for Britain to resume gold convertibility, low FRS rates fostered real estate nationally. Prices grew the most in Florida, where SGE and <italic>Caldwell </italic>refocused. By 1923, Tennessee banks had backed mortgage title and insurance agents in Florida, adding order to a complex web of titles dating back to Spanish colonial grants.<italic> </italic>In addition, Florida\u2019s popular vote of 1924 increased real estate investment by repealing income and inheritance taxes. While limiting state taxes, municipalities freely taxed property, automobiles, and gasoline. With the real estate boom, municipalities tapped <italic>Caldwell </italic>to raise debt for roads and PUs. \nReal estate developers needed credit to finance construction and carry inventory before selling to the end buyer with sparse bank credit in the young unit banking state. Brokers purchased binders\u201430 to 60-day call options\u2014with embedded leverage. However, as title transfer delays increased, investors traded the binders instead. As these leveraged real estate transactions became increasingly liquid, Florida\u2019s legislature limited real estate brokerage effective October 1925, and the market collapsed. Banking continued, and Jacksonville building permits soon hit new peaks. \nEarlier in Georgia, as bank mergers increased with WWI, <italic>American</italic> NB merged into <italic>Atlanta</italic> NB, and in 1919, <italic>Citizens & Southern Bank of Savannah</italic> merged with <italic>Third</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>, forming <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic> NB (distinct from the Black-owned bank in Philadelphia). And as sugar rationing squeezed <italic>Coca Cola</italic>, <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic>\u2019s Ernest Woodruff bought <italic>Coca Cola </italic>from the Candler family in 1916, and took <italic>Coca Cola</italic> public by 1919 while <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic> retained an interest. \nWhile Ernest Woodruff remained President of <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic> until stepping down to Chair in 1922, his son Robert assumed <italic>Coca Cola</italic>\u2019s presidency by 1923, where he remained for decades. As droughts stymied hydro power, <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic> accelerated mergers under a new president, acquiring <italic>Lowry</italic> NB in 1923 and <italic>Atlanta</italic> NB in 1924, while <italic>Atlanta Trust Co </italic>hired former lawyer Eugene Black Sr as his son soon led security sales for<italic> Harris Forbes</italic> Atlanta and other southern offices.\nAs <italic>Alabama Power</italic> eyed PUs along the Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi coasts. Faced with political opposition to British roots, <italic>Alabama Power</italic> created a new HC, <italic>Southeastern Power</italic>, incorporated in Maine in 1924. By 1925, another severe drought affected Georgia\u2019s hydro capacity. Facing financial challenges, <italic>Georgia</italic> RR & <italic>Power Co</italic> Chair Atkinson embraced <italic>Alabama Power</italic>\u2019s proposal to join <italic>Southeastern Power.</italic> The subsequent $250 million merger formed <italic>Georgia Power Co</italic> under the Southeastern system, enabling improved services, industrialization, and financial stability. The merger, finalized in 1926, streamlined operations, lowered costs, and facilitated the completion of the North Georgia hydro group.\nDeflation and racism also helped fell Black banks. Since reopening in 1915, Mississippi\u2019s <italic>Mount Bayou</italic> SB failed 1924, leaving <italic>Delta Penny Savings </italic>of Indianola as Mississippi\u2019s last Black-owned bank. But White animosity forced Joseph Walker to flee Indianola. As he sold over <italic>Mississippi Beneficial</italic> LIC to Herman Perry\u2019s <italic>Standard</italic> LIC of Atlanta at a low price to preserve Black ownership, he co-founded <italic>Universal </italic>LIC in the<italic> Fraternal </italic>building in Memphis by 1923. After issuing<italic> Service Co </italic>stock that that he sold to <italic>Standard</italic> LIC in 1923, Perry sold <italic>Mississippi Beneficial</italic> LIC to the White-owned<italic> Southeastern Trust</italic> at a market price and pledged 51% of <italic>Standard</italic> LIC as collateral for a loan in 1924. \nAlthough Booker Washington\u2019s successor at <italic>National Negro Business League</italic>, Robert Moton, organized a loan from Julius Rosenwald and John Rockefeller, the deal required Perry to relinquish control to qualified management. With Perry reluctant for change, <italic>Southeastern Trust </italic>forced <italic>Standard</italic> LIC to fuse into the White-owned <italic>Southern </italic>LIC of Tennessee in 1925. But one closed door, opened others. Since leaving <italic>Standard</italic> LIC in 1920, Georgia-born Harry Pace engaged in media and formed <italic>Northeastern</italic> LIC in Newark, New Jersey by 1925.\nLikewise, <italic>Bankers\u2019 Trust of Atlanta</italic> (\u201cBTA\u201d) was already insolvent due to insolvent Georgia farm mortgages. In addition, BTA was a pre-FRS nonbank fiscal agent that brokered bank deposits from Florida and New York to Georgia. Congress enacted  amidst the collapse on May 26. While BA1926 did not cover railroads or banks, it redefined involuntarily petitioning. Enabled by BA1926, BTA\u2019s correspondent filed an involuntary petition against BTA in July, precipitating a run across the system. Although Jacksonville\u2019s building permit values had surpassed their 1925 high, they crashed again after BTA\u2019s bankruptcy. By April 1927, the prominent <italic>Coral Gables Corp</italic> developer reversed her policy since 1922 and filed petitions against delinquent mortgages. The following month, the Florida legislature decreed binders were enforceable contracts. Because of geographic diversification and account substitution, mortgage title and insurance companies\u2014such as those operated by <italic>Caldwell</italic>\u2014survived. \nAmidst the failure of 150 banks with BTA, so did one of the three banks Cherokee County, Georgia, <italic>Bank of Ball</italic>. Augustus Coggins <italic>Bank of Cherokee</italic>\u2019s tried to mitigate the impending financial crisis by selling assets and using fraudulent collateral for loans. Fleeing Cherokee County before the bank\u2019s closure in late 1926, Coggins faced bankruptcy proceedings, leaving depositors with recovered funds but creditors received less than 19% of owed amounts. The crisis also fostered official change. By late 1927, FRS <italic>Atlanta</italic> elected Luke Lea of Nashville a Class B Director and, soon after, appointed <italic>Atlanta Trust Co</italic> President Eugene Black Governor of FRS <italic>Atlanta</italic>, where he helped stabilize NBs in Havana with swift cash infusions.\nFrom the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>, several pre-boom bankers built up groups in Florida. While Edward Lane\u2019s<italic> Atlantic</italic> NB of Jacksonville expanded to Fairfield, Springfield, Riverside, Sanford, Palatka, West Palm Beach, Daytona Beach, and Gainesville, his Taliaferro-in-laws continued to lead <italic>First</italic> NB of Tampa. <italic>Barnett</italic> NB, under Bion Barnett, began expanding with banks in DeLand and Cocoa, followed by Avon Park, and acquired <italic>Saint-Augustine</italic> NB. The largest, however, was <italic>Florida</italic> NB of Jacksonville after Alfred DuPont, who had moved to Jacksonville in 1926, acquired control in 1927. DuPont\u2019s brother-in-law Edward Ball managed the expansion, beginning with <italic>Florida</italic> NB at Lakeland in 1929, followed by Bartow, Orlando, Daytona Beach, Saint-Petersburg, and Miami.\nMeanwhile, Black bankers merged to survive. Following the collapse of Philadelphia\u2019s real estate-focused <italic>Brown Stevens</italic> in 1925, Richard Wright converted his <italic>Citizens & Southern </italic>private bank into a SB. By 1927, <italic>Citizens & Southern </italic>fused with <italic>Keystone Bank</italic> into Philadelphia\u2019s last Black-owned bank. While Memphis\u2019 Black-owned <italic>Fraternal</italic> and <italic>Solvent</italic> savings banks and trusts merged in late 1927 amidst financial difficulties. \nBy December, Christmas withdrawals depleted the bank\u2019s cash reserves, leading to a bank run and eventual closure due to bankruptcy. As 28,000 depositors lost nearly 90% of their savings and over 50 Black businesses suffered losses, investigations traced shortages to fraud, leading to the imprisonment of the President, VP, and six other executives. As <italic>Fraternal & Solvent Savings </italic>of Memphis, and its ally, <italic>Delta Penny Savings </italic>of Indianola failed in early 1928, Richard Wright, President of <italic>National Negro Bankers\u2019 Association</italic> and <italic>Citizens & Southern </italic>of Philadelphia, pointed out that no other Black banks failed that year and that neither bank belonged to <italic>National Negro Bankers\u2019 Association</italic>. \nNo Black banks would open again in Mississippi until the 21st century. While Robert Church Jr was not implicated and continued to control Black votes, his power waned with the rise of Democrat FDR in the 1930s. After EH Crump foreclosed and seized his real estate for tax nonpayment in 1940, Church Jr continued politicking in DC. \nAmidst the crisis and national trends, White banks also merged. Since his sister married Chauncey-Justus Blair at the turn of the century, John Mitchell\u2014President of the <italic>Armour</italic> and <italic>Marshall Field</italic> dominated <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings Bank</italic>\u2014led FRS <italic>Chicago</italic> and saw his son William marry an Armour heiress in 1921 and found a brokerage that became <italic>Caldwell</italic>\u2019s Chicago correspondent. \nBy 1923, John Mitchell merged his bank with <italic>Merchants Loan & Trust </italic>into <italic>Illinois Merchants Trust </italic>in 1923 and then consolidated with <italic>Corn Exchange</italic> NB in 1924, which subsequently merged with <italic>Continental </italic>NB into<italic> </italic>Chicago main bank,<italic> Continental Illinois</italic><italic> </italic>NB. With Blair as VP, Mitchell remained President and held board seats at <italic>Chase</italic> NB, <italic>Pullman Co</italic>, AT&T, and <italic>Chicago & Alton </italic>RR, and served as Insull\u2019s main banker. \nBy 1929, <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic> NB extended a loan to and acquired <italic>Atlanta Trust Co</italic>. The same year, <italic>Coca Cola</italic> reportedly guided <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic>\u2019s merger with <italic>Fourth</italic> NB into <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>, creating the Southeast\u2019s largest NB. \nContinued to promote the \u2018talented tenth,\u2019 Rockefeller soon recruited from the first Black dynasty when founding the first New York bank hired Black tellers and managers in 1928. <italic>Dunbar</italic> NB was housed<italic> Dunbar Apartments</italic>, which John Rockefeller Jr built for Blacks in Harlem and hired Roscoe Bruce to manage. The son of the first Black elected Senator, Blanche Bruce, Roscoe graduated from <italic>Phillips</italic> <italic>Exeter</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> before heading <italic>Tuskegee Institute</italic>\u2019s Education Department. Within a year, Roscoe Bruce joined <italic>Dunbar</italic> NB\u2019s board with two other Blacks: Robert Russa Moton, principal of <italic>Tuskegee Institute</italic>; and the editor of Booker Washington-promoted <italic>New York Age</italic>. But while <italic>Dunbar Apartments </italic>continued into the 21st century, <italic>Dunbar</italic> NB did not last through the 1930s.\nSimilarly, after Alonzo Herndon died in 1927, his son Norris grew <italic>Atlanta Mutual</italic> LIC for decades. However, without children, he disbursed much of his fortune to the <italic>Herndon Foundation</italic>. But consolidation also fostered a longer lasting dynastic network. Since leaving <italic>Standard</italic> LIC in 1920, Harry Pace formed <italic>Northeastern</italic> LIC in Newark, New Jersey by 1925. From <italic>Atlanta Mutual</italic> LIC, Price\u2019s classmate Truman Gibson joined <italic>Standard</italic> LIC in the 1920s before the two men helped merge <italic>Northeastern</italic> LIC with the North\u2019s first Black LIC, <italic>Liberty</italic> of Chicago, and <italic>Supreme</italic> of Columbus, Ohio, in 1929. This merger brought advantages to <italic>Liberty</italic> LIC, including <italic>Supreme</italic>\u2019s industrial insurance and <italic>Northeastern</italic>\u2019s investments and management under Harry Pace.\n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panic of 1929</italic>\nAluminum, commercialized by electricity, was lighter than copper, steel, or tin. Like Jews, many more Christians left Southwest Germany after the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>. With hometown gas PUs that grew into BASF, Jacob Schoellkopf innovated dyes. While he bought <italic>Niagara Falls Hydro-Electric </italic>in 1877, technology remained poor. Colonel Shaw of Watertown, New York, sought to develop hydroelectricity on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls since 1887, but was unsuccessful. However, in 1892, <italic>Morgan</italic>, along with <italic>Brown</italic> and <italic>Vanderbilt</italic> funds, helped <italic>Shaw</italic> form <italic>Canadian Niagara Power</italic>, a wholly owned subsidiary of the American firm. \nBy 1895, electrolytic advances allowed him sell energy to <italic>ALUM</italic>. As <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic>, <italic>COPPER</italic>, and <italic>ALUM</italic> stabilized prices during the <italic>Panic of 1901</italic>, <italic>ALUM</italic> incorporated and joined the global cartel via a Canadian subsidiary. Meanwhile, <italic>ALUM</italic> bought water-power sites and developing its own energy. The first was S<italic>hawinigan Water & Power </italic>on the Saint-Maurice River in Canada.<italic> </italic>As <italic>ALUM</italic> bought more plants on the Saint-Lawrence River, President Roosevelt vetoed border development in 1906 to conserve the environment. \nWhile American HCs developed Canadian PUs, the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic> led Ontario to municipalize electricity. So, the HC reinvested into Spanish and Latin American hydroelectricity. Despite <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris helped <italic>Morgan </italic>sell Canadian industrial securities in France.<italic> </italic>During the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>GAS</italic> could not buy Canadian PU operating assets after<italic> </italic>hiring his Baptist minister\u2019s nephew, Cyrus Eaton, to find them. Eaton later bought the PUs and parlayed his gains to buy a partnership in <italic>Otis</italic> in 1916.\nA descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, Charles Otis was born in Cleveland to a founder of <italic>Otis Steel</italic>, whose father in turn was a Western Reserve banker and merchant. After graduation, he handled cattle in Colorado. In 1895, he returned to Cleveland and co-founded securities firm <italic>Otis</italic> and purchased a seat on NYSE. Otis helped form <italic>Cleveland Stock Exchange</italic> and served as President.\nWhile British investors had gotten a hold of <italic>Otis Steel</italic>, John Sherwin acquired the firm during WWI. Sherwin\u2019s father Nelson Sherwin, a fifth cousin of Samuel Bush,  was born in Vermont, graduated <italic>Ohio State</italic> Law, formed a partnership, and married Eliza Kidder, a fellow descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and a second cousin thrice removed Henry Kidder. \nIn the 1860s he became a regional internal revenue assessor and entered Ohio politics. After serving as postmaster of Cleveland, he began work in insurance in 1884. Nelson\u2019s nephew, Henry, moved to Cleveland in 1860, and worked in a dry goods house until becoming chief bookkeeper. In 1866, he sold his interests and entered the paint trade. In 1870, Henry partnered with Edward Williams, creating <italic>Sherwin</italic> <italic>Williams</italic>, which incorporated in 1884, with Henry later becoming Chair.\nJohn Sherwin, in 1893, married a daughter of Henry McIntosh. McIntosh began his career as a telegraph operator with <italic>Cleveland & Erie</italic> RR and became Chief Operator eight years later. He left for a bookkeeping position and returned to Cleveland in 1876 to work with Henry Payne. From 1901 to 1911, he was President of <italic>Guardian Savings </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Trust</italic>. He became Chair of the bank in 1917.  \nSherwin began as a messenger at <italic>National City Bank</italic> in Cleveland and later became cashier of NB <italic>of Elwood City</italic>, Pennsylvania, where he served two years. He returned to Cleveland to organize <italic>Park</italic> NB as cashier and director, which later consolidated into <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Cleveland</italic>. From 1920, Sherwin led the consolidation of 29 banks into <italic>Union Trust</italic> into the fifth-largest trust company in America.\nAmidst WWI in 1917, Brooklyn-born legal counselor, Julius Cohen, innovated the British public benefit corporations into America\u2019s first <italic>authority</italic>\u2014<italic>Port Authority of New York & New Jersey</italic>\u2014to settle a century-old dispute between New York and New Jersey over control of transportation on the Hudson River and in the harbor, addressing issues such as competition among railroads and conflicting regulations. \nHowever, <italic>Port Authority </italic>remained unique for many years.<italic> </italic>While<italic> </italic>Congress nationalized aluminum during WWI, but with peace, allowed the re-privatized electric firms to merge into <italic>Niagara</italic>. While <italic>Morgan </italic>controlled one of these, he relinquished her to the Schoellkopfs. In 1919, after working at <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, Russell Hutton joined Frederick Schoellkopf Jr to form <italic>Schoellkopf Hutton</italic> in Buffalo. In 1921, they added Horace Burton Pomeroy from <italic>Harris Forbes</italic> Rochester, a cousin once removed of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Henry Pomeroy Davison, forming <italic>Schoellkopf Hutton Pomeroy</italic>, which became the leading investment bank between New York and Chicago. \nAnother Pomeroy cousin married, in 1914, Floyd Carlisle, born to a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne in Watertown, New York. He practiced law with his brother, who had headed the Democratic State Executive Committee. For decades, the Sherman family\u2014extended cousins of Watts Sherman and descendants of Emperor Charlemagne\u2014engaged in banking in Watertown. By the turn of the century, George Sherman helped organize <italic>Saint-Regis Paper</italic> and became President of <italic>National Bank & Loan</italic>. \nIn 1910, Carlisle merged <italic>National Bank & Loan Co </italic>and<italic> National Union Bank</italic> to form <italic>Northern New York Trust</italic>, serving as President. By 1916, he led a syndicate to beat out <italic>New York World</italic>\u2019s Pulitzer family to buy <italic>Saint-Regis Paper</italic>, which began acquiring water-power sites. In 1920 he organized a group to purchase <italic>Northern New York Utilities</italic>. By 1922 he formed <italic>Power Corp</italic> of New York and established New York investment bank <italic>Carlisle</italic>.\nWith the start of WWI, GGE sold most of her PUs to BGGE and America directed SGE to seize German PUs in the Americas and withdraw patents by 1917. While FRS stabilized the <italic>dollar </italic>and MMSEC, allowing NYSE challenged <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> and London\u2019s MMBU, anti-German sentiment forced Paul Warburg to leave FRS in 1918. By 1920, <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Morgan </italic>invested in <italic>Rothschild </italic>Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>. Paul\u2019s brother, Max, partnered with Fritz Mannheimer\u2019s new <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam. After Max\u2019s Hamburg banks raised capital for GGE, 1921, Paul Warburg started <italic>International Acceptance</italic> in New York to rebuild Europe with investors including Cassel and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. \nAs <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>-head Marcus Wallenberg\u2019s daughter wed an aristocratic Oppenheim in 1919, both sons trained at New York\u2019s <italic>Citi</italic> NB and <italic>Brown</italic>, Jacob went to <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> in Zurich and Marcus Jr to British <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Hambro.</italic> By 1922, Mauritz Philipson helped transform <italic>Svenska Handelsbank</italic> into a nationwide major bank, initially complementing Carl Frisk\u2019s boldness with caution. However, his passivity during a financial crisis in 1923, his reluctance to support match financier Ivar Kreuger, and his collaboration with outsider Marcus Wallenberg resulted in his forced resignation in 1923. He remained on other boards and the family grew relationships.\n<italic>Warburg</italic> helped connect Sweden to Europe and America. Since Max Warburg married Alice Magnez in 1899, their son Eric\u2014a nephew of Paul and Felix Warburg\u2014served in the German Army in 1918 before apprenticing in New York\u2019s <italic>Kuhn</italic> and London\u2019s <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. From 1929, he was a managing partner at <italic>Warburg</italic> in Hamburg and Amsterdam. Max Warburg\u2019s cousin Elsa married Danish Melchior, who later oversaw <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg. \nSince Elsa\u2019s sister married Lars Philipson, his niece married Siegmund Warburg, son of Georges Warburg and Lucie Kaulla. Lars\u2019 cousin Walter was the CEO of <italic>Custodia </italic>management and was involved in the merger of his brother-in-law\u2019s<italic> Nordiska Kompaniet </italic>with the Wallenbergs. Walter was a member of Sweden\u2019s banking council from 1913 to 1927 and participated in the <italic>Panic of 1917</italic> bank committee. Marrying Gothenburg-born merchant Eduard Fr\u00e4nckel\u2019s daughter, he led <italic>Stockholm Stock Exchange</italic> from 1926 to 1932.\nBut the Swedish connection also ran through many banks, including <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York. Born into a family of merchants, politicians, and theologians in Switzerland, Ernest Meili apprenticed at <italic>Schweizerische Volksbank</italic> (<italic>Banque Populaire Suisse</italic>) from 1917 to 1920. He then moved to Paris, joining <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris in 1920 before transferring to <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> London in 1922. In 1923, Meili relocated to New York, where he became private secretary to financier Ivar Kreuger. Later that year, he joined <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York. By 1927, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York recruited Norbert Bogdan to help with the rising acceptance business. Born in Abbatisia, Italy, Bogdan studied at <italic>Cambridge</italic> and<italic> London School of Economics</italic> before working at <italic>Scandinaviska Kredit</italic> in Sweden. \nOne of the most successful Swedish industrialists of the era was Axel Wenner-Gren. After buying a share in the European agent representing vacuum cleaners, Wenner-Gren became the agent for the <italic>Lux</italic> vacuum cleaner in Germany in 1912. Subsequently, <italic>Electrolux</italic>, AB <italic>Lux</italic>, and <italic>Elektromekaniska</italic> AB merged in 1919, with Wenner-Gren assuming the role of the company\u2019s president. Throughout the 1920s, <italic>Electrolux</italic> rapidly expanded its global presence, establishing sales companies and manufacturing plants across multiple countries. \nAlso in 1925, <italic>Consolidated Edison</italic> Anthony Brady\u2019s son Nicholas acquired the rights to <italic>Platen Munters</italic>\u2019 electric refrigerating system to explore alternative gas-power. This collaboration led to the development of a gas refrigerator that operated without electricity and moving parts, gaining popularity in New York City apartments due to strong support from <italic>Consolidated Edison</italic> and its partnership with plumbing and heating contractors, amidst fierce competition from electric refrigerator manufacturers.\nMeanwhile, New York politics evolved. Since Seligman and fellow Republicans broke New York\u2019s corrupt <italic>Tammany Hall </italic>in the 1870s, Democrats reformed the patronage system. One notable Jewish reformer migrated from the Confederacy. Following the Civil War, Major Adolph Proskauer and his brother Alfred worked for <italic>Lehman</italic> in Mobile, but their business failed by 1880. Alfred then joined his father-in-law\u2019s small private bank. After Alfred\u2019s son Joseph left Alabama to attend college in New York, he joined <italic>Tammany Hall</italic>. After political setbacks, he became a lawyer at <italic>Elkus</italic>, where he met Irishman Alfred Smith.  \nAfter the <italic>Triangle Shirtwaist Factory</italic> tragedy, Smith and fellow <italic>Tammany Hall</italic> member German Methodist Robert Wagner shifted their focus to progressive worker\u2019s rights. Aligning their interests with reformist Boston Brahmin heiress Frances Perkins, they promoted both Wagner and Smith to the governorship of New York, and then federal offices. Smith awarded Proskauer with a seat on the state\u2019s Court and Perkins to head New York\u2019s <italic>State Industrial Commission</italic>, who recruited Robert Moses to reform urban development. While Moses was not related to the Alabama Moses family, his mother was a relative of the Cohen-Seligman family of Mobile, and his aunt had married <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Abraham Wolff, the father-in-law of Otto Kahn.\nPost-WWI, Congress re-privatized aluminum and leased PUs to <italic>Niagara </italic>in 1920. As <italic>Morgan</italic>, GE, New York\u2019s Republican legislature, Andrew Mellon, <italic>DuPont</italic>, Eaton, and Duke supported <italic>ALUM</italic> to developing the Saint-Lawrence River hydroelectricity, Governor Smith vetoed private PUs. The head of one of the South\u2019s most prominent merchant banking Jewish families Alabama\u2019s Alfred Moses\u2014father-in-law of <italic>AMAX</italic>\u2019s Carl Loeb\u2014lost heavily as projects<italic> </italic>refocused to Canadian Niagara, the Tennessee River, and the Carolinas, where the Dukes subsidized electricity, education, and health care. \nOut of Cleveland, Eaton bought Midwestern PUHCs, rubber, and steel firms. Likewise, <italic>Union Trust</italic>\u2019s John Sherwin served on the bank creditors\u2019 committee that reorganized <italic>Goodyear Tire & Rubber</italic><italic> </italic>in 1921. Likewise, Sherwin financed <italic>Sweringen</italic>\u2019s acquisitions of railroads, merged <italic>Chandler</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Hupp</italic> motors, and secured the <italic>Fisher Body</italic> plant for Cleveland In 1916 the Sweringen brothers of Ohio had purchased <italic>Nickel Plate</italic> RR from <italic>New York Central</italic>, financed in part through <italic>Guardian Trust</italic>. In 1922 they acquired the <italic>Toledo</italic>, <italic>Saint-Louis & Western</italic> RR and <italic>Lake Erie & Western</italic> RR, which they fused with permission form ICC.\nMoreover, New York City banks hired Southerners and other Americans, mostly with ties to bankers, industrialists, and politicians around Tennessee. Following his service in <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Export </italic>department during WWI, Waddill Catchings assumed leadership at <italic>Sloss-Sheffield Steel & Iron</italic> in Birmingham, Alabama, before becoming a <italic>Goldman </italic>partner in 1918. <italic>Caldwell</italic> spearheaded the expansion of banks from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ohio River, with branches in key cities. As Howard Sheperd joined <italic>Citi</italic>, Eugene Black joined <italic>Harris Forbes</italic> in 1918. While <italic>Chemical</italic> NB recruited Southern-born Nathaniel Baxter Jackson and Harold Helm, both from <italic>Vanderbilt </italic>and <italic>Princeton</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic>hired Longstreet Hinton in 1923.\nLikewise, the Kaufman brothers, Christian descendants of Dutch Knickerbockers and the Flemish Coyman cousins of the Medici, linked Great Lakes iron to New York. While Nathan held executive roles in <italic>Washington Iron Mining Co</italic> and <italic>Negaunee Iron</italic>, and became President of <italic>Marquette Savings Bank</italic>, Louis was President of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Marquette</italic> and <italic>Chatham Phenix</italic> NB <italic>& Trust</italic> in New York and a director <italic>General Motor</italic>, with Pierre DuPont as a director of the latter two. Following the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>, Louis\u2019 daughter married <italic>Morgan</italic> cousin George Drexel Biddle of Philadelphia in 1926.\nAlong with dominating the chemicals industry, the DuPonts held broad banking interests. While <italic>DuPont</italic> IHC protected family shareholdings since 1919, Pierre served on the boards of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, <italic>Detroit</italic> NB, <italic>Wilmington Trust</italic>, <italic>Philadelphia</italic> NB, and <italic>Equitable</italic> LIC. His brother Lammot sat on the boards of <italic>Chemical </italic>NB, <italic>Fidelity Philadelphia Trust</italic>, and <italic>Wilmington Trust</italic>. Married to Pierre\u2019s third cousin once removed and cousin-in-law, Donaldson Brown was a NB <italic>of Detroit</italic> director. Pierre\u2019s secretary, John Raskob, directed <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> and <italic>Lawyers County Trust</italic>. \nSince the start of the oil era, <italic>DuPont</italic> formed a lucrative, long-term relationship supplying <italic>OIL</italic> with sulfuric acid. Likewise, Pierre\u2019s uncle Alfred dominated Louisville\u2019s wealthiest man through prosperous ventures including paper pulp production, city railway investments, and Kentucky coal mining from the 1880s. In 1927, <italic>DuPont</italic> extended into <italic>STEEL</italic>. By then <italic>STEEL</italic> and <italic>Rockefeller</italic> interests kinterlinked as a son of <italic>Morgan </italic>Partner Henry Pomeroy Davison married Anne Stillman, a  daughter of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s co-founder, in 1924 and Anne\u2019s cousin James Stillman Rockefeller wed Nancy Carnegie in 1925.\nAfter his parents fled D\u00fcsseldorf and fought for the Confederacy, Alabama-born Nathan Jonas relocated to Brooklyn with his family in 1869. In 1905, he assumed the presidency of <italic>Citizens Trust Co</italic>. After <italic>Citizens Trust Co</italic> merged with <italic>Manufacturers </italic>NB<italic> of Brooklyn </italic>in 1914, the bank changed her name to <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic>. Jonas bought <italic>Bank of America</italic> and organized <italic>Financial & Industrial Securities</italic> BHC to hold their bank interests in 1925. Of the thousands of NBs, only a handful of Jewish banks received charters, primarily after WWI.\nAnother one was <italic>Foreman</italic> NB of Chicago. Since Henry Greenebaum, from the family of a representative of Napoleon\u2019s Grand Sanhedrin related to the Rothschilds, built one of Chicago\u2019s first Jewish banks, his sister wed fellow Bavarian Gerhard Foreman, who started a bank and saw his cousin later marry Abraham Kuhn\u2019s cousins. As Greenebaum\u2019s Straus cousins thrived with <italic>Macy</italic>, they kinterlinked with Lehman and Kuhn. In 1923, the bank reorganized as <italic>Foreman</italic> NB and <italic>Foreman Trust & Savings Bank</italic> and merged into one of Chicago\u2019s three largest banks by 1929. Another was <italic>Bank of the United States</italic> (\u201cBOUS\u201d) NB in 1925, a BIHC which had more depositors than any other and redefining New York City\u2019s skyline.\nMeanwhile, the Scottish diaspora enacted Britain\u2019s colonial policy. Alan Anderson, a son of a Scottish reverend, joined his family ship owning firm, <italic>Anderson</italic>, in 1897 and became Partner in 1900. After his father\u2019s death in 1907, Anderson, along with his cousin Irvine Geddes, built new ships following <italic>Royal Mail Steam Packet Co</italic>\u2019s withdrawal from the Pacific. During WWI, Anderson contributed to the Board of Trade and the Royal Commission on Wheat Supplies and became Controller of the Navy in 1917. He was appointed KBE in 1917 and joined the Board of BOE in 1918.\nAlan Anderson\u2019s uncle was Acland Geddes, a prominent civil engineer involved in Indian railways. During WWI, their son Eric Geddes served as Controller of the Admiralty and First Lord of the Admiralty. He subsequently oversaw post-war reforms to improve operational effectiveness. Since Britain switched from federal to local PU regulation before legalizing cartels, municipalities protected their gas PUs from competition, and her colonies had disparate and underdeveloped services. Electrification allowed collieries to grow exports. As global mining grew through the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, coal deflated with oil, hydroelectricity, and as peace resumed trade. \nIn 1919, PM Lloyd George appointed Geddes to reorg all of Britain\u2019s transport facilities, including docks and electricity, into an integrated system modernized by the state. MP George Balfour opposed Geddes\u2019 proposals for electricity reorg in 1919, but later supported the establishment of a state-appointed Central Electricity Board in 1926. Geddes also consolidated 123 separate railway companies into four regional groupings in 1921. Generally, Parliament eased railway cartelization and PU consolidation to control deflation. Despite cartel legalization, coal estates remained fragmented.\nA Scot by ancestry, George Balfour became a MP in 1918 to push Britain to privatize and consolidate PUs. By 1922, Balfour stared <italic>Power</italic> PUIHC to develop Scottish hydroelectricity. <italic>Power</italic> soon became Britain\u2019s largest PUHC. Affiliating with GE\u2019s <italic>International</italic> GE (\u201cIGE\u201d), Balfour expanded across Britain\u2019s colonial empire from 1924 with director interlocks. As <italic>Power</italic> acted as manager and shareholder to the PUs, <italic>Balfour Beatty</italic> contracted power station construction, and IGE supplied the equipment. Likewise, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> financed Peruvian streetcars in 1922 and <italic>Lazard </italic>London invested in PUs from Malaya to Athens, buying all the public electricity and transport undertakings in the latter.\nIn 1922, Eric Geddes resigned from the House of Commons and joined <italic>Dunlop Rubber</italic>\u2019s board, becoming Chair later that year. <italic>Dunlop</italic>\u2019s territory stretched from Malayan rubber plantations to Midland factories making tires, rackets, balls, cushions, and so on. He also chaired <italic>Imperial Airways</italic> from 1924, formed that year with the intention of being Britain\u2019s \u2018chosen instrument\u2019 for overseas air service. Eric\u2019s youngest brother, Irvine, was for many years Chair of <italic>Orient Steam Navigation Co</italic> and a director of <italic>Imperial Airways</italic>.\nEric\u2019s middle brother Auckland served with the Northumberland Fusiliers in France, later becoming Minister of National Service in 1917. Elected as a Unionist MP for Basingstoke in the same year, Geddes held positions including President of the Local Government Board and Minister of Reconstruction. Appointed British Ambassador to America in 1920, he later chaired the Royal Commission on Food Prices in 1924 and joined the Board of <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>, becoming Chair in 1925.    \nOf unknown relation to the other Geddes family, Andrew Geddes joined the board of <italic>Anglo-South American Bank</italic>\u2014the former <italic>Bank of Tarapaca</italic><italic> </italic>of Chile\u2014in 1911 until his death in 1928, when the bank became the largest British overseas bank. <italic>Anglo-South </italic>acquired <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic> in 1912, <italic>Commercial Bank of Spanish America</italic> in 1918, and, in 1920, <italic>British Bank of South America</italic> and <italic>Edwards</italic>, an Anglo-Chilean merchant bank that developed Chilean nitrate in the 1850s. British-descended Agustin Edwards III served as Ambassador to Great Britain from 1910 to 1925 and VP and President of <italic>League of Nations</italic> <italic>Assembly</italic> in 1921 and 1922. Edwards\u2019 son, Agustin IV, training at <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris around the time.\nAfter years of inflation, prices deflated in 1922. While Japan enacted an insolvency procedure for smaller firms, large firms continued to lack a bankruptcy process. Amidst the crisis, BOJ began a policy of avoiding deflation and rediscounting bank debt, which accelerated as an earthquake struck Japan in 1923. As part of reconstruction efforts, the Japanese government and private sector entities worked together to rebuild the electricity grid and consolidate banks and utilities. The zaibatsu played a significant role in the reconstruction effort\u2014particularly relying on NYSE debt placed by <italic>Dillon </italic>and <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2014along with financing from GE. \nWhile <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> remained dominant since British Canada confederated in 1866, the Canadian banking sector became highly concentrated, with the five largest banks controlling almost all bank assets by WWI. These banks and Americans also concentrated LICs, manufacturers, miners, telecoms, and\u2014in the 20s\u2014paper. \nSince WWI, Americans built hydro-electric plants in Canada and supplied natural gas to New Brunswick, south Ontario, and Alberta. Private PU reigned almost without regulation or competition in Quebec and British Columbia. In Quebec, Herbert Holt formed Montreal\u2019s largest PU and became President of <italic>Royal Bank of Canada </italic>since 1908, inter-locking with <italic>Shawinigan </italic>PU and other firms. In 1924, Holt and <italic>Shawinigan </italic>bought <italic>Montreal Tramways</italic>. In British Columbia, <italic>British Columbia Electric </italic>RR acquired both <italic>Western Canada Power </italic>and <italic>Bridge River Power</italic>. \nCanada\u2019s growth also formed new links with Britain. The eldest son of Reverand William Peacock of Glengarry, Ontario, Edward Peacock joined <italic>Dominion Securities</italic>, newly chartered in Ontario as a subsidiary of <italic>Central </italic><italic>Canada Loan & Saving</italic><italic> </italic>in 1901. Working closely with <italic>Speyer</italic>, he opened <italic>Dominion</italic>\u2019s London office by 1909. In 1915 he negotiated refinancing for <italic>Brazilian Traction Light </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Power</italic>, securing financing from<italic> Baring</italic> in 1920. The following year, he joined BOE\u2019s Court and, three years later, <italic>Baring</italic> as a partner in 1924\u2014the first \u2018overseas\u2019 Briton to hold the post\u2014overseeing issues for <italic>North Metropolitan Power Station Co</italic>, <italic>Charing Cross Electricity Supply Co</italic>, and other interests.\nSince Republicans won the White House, UST Secretary Andrew Mellon shaped taxes. With tax-exempt debt interest, lower income tax inflated equity.  streamlined TA1921\u2019s tax-free reorg rules and expanded spin-off tax benefits, allowing GE to spin off SGE. Although GE sold her SGE stock, SGE\u2019s PUs continued to buy GE equipment. Likewise, <italic>Morgan </italic>had no SGE board seats. Instead, <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Dillon</italic>, <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, <italic>Griscom</italic>, and other bankers split the board with <italic>Morgan </italic>contacts from IT&T<italic> </italic>and others<italic>.</italic> SGE soon consolidated Cuba\u2019s PUs, which Bavarian Frank Steinhart had developed since WWI. \nUnderwriting Canadian PUs associated with the paper industry since 1912, Montreal financiers AJ Nesbitt and PA Thomson formed <italic>Canada</italic> <italic>Power </italic>PUIHC with Holt in 1925 to consolidate Canadian power against foreign threats and develop hydroelectricity. While holding cross-directorships in <italic>Mohawk-Hudson Power </italic>in Eastern New York with the Schoellkopfs, Pomeroy-in-law Floyd Carlisle he consolidated some Saint-Lawrence River industrial PUs holdings into <italic>Northeastern Power</italic>, controlled through <italic>Saint-Regis Paper</italic>, in 1926.\nAs <italic>ALUM</italic> consolidated Saint-Lawrence River PUs and <italic>Niagara </italic>into <italic>Buffalo-Niagara Power</italic><italic> </italic>with <italic>Schoellkopf Hutton Pomeroy</italic>, GE, and <italic>DuPont</italic> that year to develop the Saint-Lawrence River, New York Governor Al Smith politicized <italic>Buffalo-Niagara </italic>and expropriated private land from Niagara to Long Island for public parks with <italic>Kuhn</italic>-cousin Robert Moses. Smith also appointed <italic>Port Authority of New York & New Jersey</italic>\u2019s Julius Cohen as legal counsel to bring more funding to the state\u2019s housing commission.\nWhile New York investment bank <italic>Bonbright</italic> became a leading PU financier, Bonbright\u2019s brother-in-law, mechanical engineer Morris Cook, accepted an appointment to study combining PUs into a supersystem by Governor of Pennsylvania Gifford Pinchot in 1923. While Pinchot\u2019s cousin had married William Graves\u2014a nephew of <italic>Morgan Harjes</italic> Partner Henry Harjes\u2019s wife\u2014who served as secretary of <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> Paris, he was socialist. As Pinchot called to federalize PUs, President Hoover advocated private inter-state connections. Although state borders split energy sources, Insull led PUs in spreading electricity across state lines and beyond urban areas. \nThe Court stimulated HCs as  held corporate purchases and retirements of discounted debt as tax-free reorgs but restricted state energy control. After<italic> Munn</italic> set PU fair market returns at the original cost during 1880s deflation, historic costs fell relative to forecasts with 1920s inflation. As the Court shifted to replacement costs in 1926, PU rates stabilized.And after limiting inter-state natural gas regulation in 1924, the Court barred states from regulating inter-state PU rate contracts in  in 1927. \nTo lift Britain out of depression and back on the gold standard, FRS kept rates low from 1924. Like BOE Governor Montague Norman was connected to <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Brown Shipley</italic>, FRS <italic>New York</italic> Governor Benjamin Strong had links <italic>Morgan</italic>. Without the other FRS District Bank Governors, Norman and Strong collaborated to stabilize the <italic>pound</italic> by inflating <italic>dollar</italic> credit and preventing gold outflows to Britain\u2019s empire. FRS\u2019 capital controls required permission from BOE for foreign securities over \u00a31 million. While <italic>Grenfell</italic> and other British copper interests merged, British post-war coal subsidies expired in 1926, leading to record strikes. \nAs America\u2019s Court held that inter-state strikes violate AA1890, unions gave way to cheaper Southern labor and oil. Militias long massacred striking coal families, but Kentucky coalers starved as law enforcers and courts used prisoner labor to mine and the Ku Klux Clan lynched organizers. As AA1918 allowed export cartels, copper interests consolidated. A year after acquiring <italic>BRASS</italic> in 1922, <italic>COPPER</italic> bought the world\u2019s largest copper mine in Chile from Guggenheim\u2019s <italic>Kennecott</italic>. By 1926, <italic>COPPER</italic>, <italic>Kennecott</italic>, <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic>, <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>, and other interests formed a global copper cartel.\n privileged domestic oil drilling with depletion allowances, shifted capital stock taxes to income, and limited tax-free HCs dividends to controlled subsidiaries. As TA1926 set HC control at 95% of shares and AA1914 prevented unregulated HCs, PUHCs used leverage to buy shares unlike unregulated asset mergers. Mergers grew after 1926 as the Court held that AA1890 did not cover asset mergers. BA1926 deemed receiverships to be bankruptcies and distributed assets equally.\nBA1926 did not void Tennessee\u2019s 1877 local creditor preference, but <italic>Caldwell</italic>\u2019s municipal bonds deflated with property taxes. As courts discharged most debts, credit shifted from unsecured CP to collateralized loans. As MMSEC grew in 1926, FRS ordered NYSE to collect data and NYCH to tax it. Although MMSEC briefly contracted, it soon outgrew the low-yield, FRS-discounted one. \nWhen German <italic>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</italic> started the supra-national steel cartel in 1926, Britain refused to join. <italic>STEEL</italic> and Rockefeller\u2019s steel interests joined by 1928. But as America privileged oil with depletion allowances with TA1926, coal deflated, and unions disbanded. \nLikewise, shortly after German chemical giant <italic>Farben</italic><italic> </italic>formed in 1925, <italic>Midland Bank</italic> funded the creation of <italic>Imperial Chemical Industries</italic><italic> </italic>by amalgamating <italic>Nobel </italic>Britian, <italic>Brunner Mond</italic> (which had secured rights to the Solvay process in Britain in 1883), <italic>United Alkali</italic><italic> </italic>(formed after a merger of Leblanc-process soda in 1905), and <italic>British Dyestuffs Corp </italic>(which was formed by the government during WWI to secure dyestuff). <italic>Farben </italic>allied with French dye makers in 1927, but ties with protectionist British and French firms failed. So, <italic>Farben</italic> entered cartels agreements with <italic>ALUM</italic> for magnesium, <italic>Ford</italic> for vehicles, and <italic>OIL</italic> for oil distribution agreements Norway, Chile, and Britain.\nUnlike the socialist dyestuffs producer, the British Government had asked William Lever\u2019s <italic>Lever </italic>to transport Dutch margarine and, to protect against German interference, produce it. William Lever, born in Britain to a Congregational family, founded <italic>Lever</italic> in 1885, establishing a soap factory in Warrington amid the economic depression of the 1880s. <italic>Lever</italic> pioneered vertical integration, controlling production from raw materials to distribution, which enabled rapid international expansion, establishing operations from Africa to America.\nDespite the competition, Dutch margarine firms <italic>Jurgens</italic> and <italic>Bergh</italic>, associated with <italic>Pierson</italic>, refused a cartel as prices fell in the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, but consolidated with <italic>Schicht</italic> of Czechoslovakia. The Christian Schichts had been one of Austria\u2019s premier soap manufacturers and kinterlinked with converted Hungarian nobles descended from the Arnsteins and allied with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna as they received financing from <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> and Petschek at the turn of the century.\nBack in 1889, when the nine largest British West Africa\u2019s palm oil traders\u2014<italic>Harrison</italic>, <italic>British & Continental African Co</italic>, <italic>Couper Johnstone</italic>, <italic>Hatton Cookson</italic>, <italic>Helt Cotterell</italic>, <italic>King</italic>, <italic>Stuart</italic> <italic>Douglas</italic>, <italic>Taylor Laughland</italic>, and George Watts\u2014merged to form <italic>African Association </italic>in Liverpool to dominate the palm oil trade. After ruinous competition with other companies, <italic>African Association</italic> formed <italic>Niger Pool</italic> with <italic>Niger Co</italic> and <italic>Miller</italic>. \nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London financed <italic>Lever</italic>\u2019s acquisition of <italic>Niger Co</italic> to vertically integrate palm and coconut oil supplies, which led <italic>African Association</italic> and <italic>Mille</italic><italic>r</italic> to form <italic>African & Eastern Trade Corp</italic>. However, Lever lost control of <italic>Lever</italic> to <italic>Barclay</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Cooper</italic>\u2014an heir of <italic>London & County Bank</italic>\u2019s former Chair and accountancy <italic>Cooper</italic>, which had long worked for <italic>Lever</italic>\u2014and diversified into motor distribution and other West African ventures. By 1922, <italic>Lazard</italic> London raised funds for <italic>Schicht</italic>\u2019s Dutch firms.\nAs <italic>Rotterdam Bank</italic> interests merged <italic>Bergh</italic>, <italic>Jurgens</italic>, and several other Dutch margarine firms into <italic>Margarine Union </italic>against ruinous competition in 1927, <italic>Margarine Union</italic> took over <italic>Schicht</italic> the following year. After <italic>African & Eastern Trade Corp</italic> invited <italic>Shell</italic> Britain\u2019s Robert Waley Cohen to be Chair, Cohen merged with <italic>Lever</italic>\u2019s <italic>Niger Co</italic> into <italic>United Africa Co</italic> (\u201cUAC\u201d) by 1929, and <italic>Lever</italic> merged with <italic>Margarine Union </italic>into <italic>Unilever</italic> to stabilize the palm oil trade. <italic>Unilever</italic> also made loans to <italic>Schicht</italic>-affiliated <italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>, which increased local ownership from 1927.\nLikely a cousin of <italic>Huth</italic>\u2019s Meinertzhagens, Geoffrey Heyworth of Liverpool joined <italic>Lever</italic> in 1912 as a clerk and later moved to the Canadian subsidiary. After WWI, he returned to London to manage <italic>Lever</italic>\u2019s export trade and later the soap company. By 1931, he was a Director of <italic>Unilever</italic>. Since Meinertzhagen cousin Richard Potter Holt, of the family that co-founded <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic>, became Chair of that bank, he took control of and chaired West Africa-focused <italic>Elder Dempster Shipping</italic> from 1932. Meinertzhagen-in-law George Booth remained a director of BOE since 1915 and his cousin Charles continued to be a director of <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> and Chair of South America-focused <italic>Booth Shipper</italic>.\nSimilarly, likely descended from palm oil pioneers Liverpool<italic> Horsfall</italic> of Yorkshire, John Horsfall inherited a barony and control of <italic>Horsfall</italic> worsted spinners. He was also a director at <italic>Barclay</italic>, underwriter at <italic>Lloyd</italic>, Chair of <italic>Illingworth Morris</italic>, <italic>Lansil</italic>, and <italic>Halifax Building Society</italic>, and was High Sheriff of Yorkshire from 1927 to 1928. \nAnd a son of a South African miller, Percy Horsfall joined <italic>English Electric</italic> in the early 1920s after serving in South Africa\u2019s Colonial Service with Brand, before<italic> </italic>heading <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s <italic>New Issues </italic>Department. By 1929, Brand and Horsfall hired Adam Marris, whose father William was a Governor of Indian Assam and the United Agra and Oudh Provinces. That year, the relationship between <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> tightened as Reginald Grenfell married a Langhorne sister, becoming in-laws with <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand and Viscount Astor. \nMeanwhile, British Parliament unsuccessfully promoted coal mergers and Insull advised on networking strategies to maximize PU efficiency, like he did across America. Insull also joined <italic>British Power & Light </italic>PUHC, which Grenfell-cousin <italic>Benson</italic> and <italic>Stein</italic> established to buy out private PUs. With Belgian ancestry, London-born merchant banker Edward Stein served in the <italic>Royal Rifle Corps</italic> during WWI and joined Herbert afterward. \nMichael Henry Herbert, son of an American mother\u2014related to the Astors and Vanderbilts, and brother of the Earl of Pembroke and Ambassador to America from 1902\u2014and Captain Sidney, Grenfell\u2019s colleague as a Conservative MP. After <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> hired Herbert in 1924, Stein formed <italic>Stein</italic>. Stein was a <italic>Columbia Graphophone </italic>director by 1920 and helped merge it with <italic>Gramophone </italic>in 1930 into what became EMI, and chaired tobacco merchant <italic>Gallaher</italic>, and <italic>Mercantile Credit</italic>, and <italic>Finance Houses Association </italic>into the 1950s. \nBy 1927, Britain\u2019s <italic>Imperial Continental Gas Association</italic> (\u201cICGA\u201d) converted into a HC to mitigate double taxation by taking advantage of tax differences and lending money to her Belgian subsidiaries. Except for monopolies,<italic> </italic>Anglo-Dutch colonial free<italic> </italic>trade continued as the Dutch avoided tariffs to placate Japan. \nIn America, Jewish banks linked with Protestant banks. In 1927, <italic>Dillon</italic> hired William Draper Jr from <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>. Graduating from NYU in 1917 with a BA and MA in economics, Draper became a second lieutenant in the infantry with the outbreak of WWI in 1917. Between 1919 and 1923, he worked with <italic>Citi</italic> and spent four years as Assistant Treasurer at <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, eventually becoming <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s Treasurer and VP. Along with <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Dillon</italic> accounted for half of American loans to Germany. In 1926, <italic>Dillion</italic> hired coal mines the English-speaking son of a Christian manager of Germany\u2019s <italic>United Steel Works</italic>.\n<italic>Dillon</italic> also retained Christian apprentices, including Hugh Bullock. His father, Calvin, had founded <italic>Bullock</italic> in Denver, <italic>Kidder</italic>\u2019s only correspondent between Denver and San Francisco. Calvin was born in Toledo, Ohio, where his father moved to become the treasurer of <italic>Toledo & Wabash</italic> RR in the 1850s, while his cousin Alex Bullock\u2014a cousin of the Thayer and Whitney families and cousin-in-law of the Boston Brahmin\u2014remained in Massachusetts and served as Governor. Graduating <italic>Williams College</italic> in 1892, Calvin founded <italic>Bullock</italic> in Denver in 1894. which soon opened offices in several American cities, Canada, and Britain. By 1927, he moved headquarters to New York and served as President of <italic>US Electric Light </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Power Shares</italic> and other PUIHCs.\nSince <italic>Seligman</italic> partner Albert Strauss married a Christian extended cousin of John Morgan and served a FRS Vice Governor, <italic>Seligman</italic> promoted three non-Jewish <italic>Cravath </italic>alums, including Francis Randolph and Earle Bailie, to partner in 1923. A son of a <italic>Baltimore & Ohio</italic> RR VP of the Virginia Tidewater and an extended cousin of <italic>Morgan </italic>partners, Randolph practiced at <italic>Cravath</italic> after graduating <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law until WWI, when he worked on relief and UST efforts in Europe, and joined <italic>Seligman</italic> in 1920. \nBailie, after graduating from the <italic>Uni of Minnesota</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law, lawyered at <italic>Cravath</italic> and served in Army during WWI until joining <italic>Seligman</italic> in 1919, marrying an Iselin\u2014and second cousin twice removed of John Morgan Jr\u2019s wife\u20141923, and then launched <italic>Seligman</italic>\u2019s IHC. Also in 1923, Seligman\u2019s Gimbel cousin-in-laws kinterlinked with mixed-religion <italic>Newman Saunders</italic>\u2019 Jacob Newman, co-founder of SGE.\nThe Iselins originated in Basel, Switzerland, where they engaged trade and silk manufacturing. After Isaac Iselin emigrated to America in 1801 and became a New York merchant and kinterlinked with <italic>Rossier</italic>, his son Adrian followed as an importer and wed the daughter of Baltimore financier Columbus O\u2019Donnell, connected with <italic>Baltimore & Ohio </italic>RR. \nAs his daughter married Colonel Delancey Astor O\u2019Kane in 1872, linking the Iselins to the Rensselaer, Astor, and Roosevelt families, Adrian founded <italic>Iselin</italic> bank. Likewise, his Swiss cousins kinterlinked with the LaRoche, Koechlin, and Sarasin families. In 1906, Adrien granddaughter married a son of deceased banker Charles Livermore, whose widow had married Baron Seilli\u00e8re of <italic>Demachy Seilli\u00e8re</italic> in 1892.\nThrough the 19th century, Pierre Schlumberger, Jean Thierry and Anne-Catherine Mieg, and Samuel Koechlin founded Alsatian textile enterprises. As their descendants kinterlinked, some expanded in textiles, while others diversified. One Thierry-Mieg descendant became a <italic>Parisienne</italic> representative in Egypt. Another Schlumberger cousin, Marguerite Mieg Favre married <italic>Suez Canal</italic> heir and director Bernard Lesseps.\nSince two Swiss Koechlin brothers married a Rossier and Meja, their brothers-in-law founded <italic>Franco-Swiss Bank</italic> in 1894 (renamed <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic> in 1917 after becoming <italic>Brown\u2019</italic>s correspondent), the bank formed <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9</italic> in 1898 alongside <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Lehideux</italic><italic> </italic>in 1898. \nFrom 1920<italic>,</italic> Roger Lehideux served on the boards of <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, and <italic>Nationale</italic>. Lehideux\u2019s sister had married Pierre Thureau-Dangin, a son of an administrator of <italic>Saint-Gobain</italic>. Pierre\u2019s brother married a first cousin once removed of Paul Leroy-Beaulieu, representative of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris on <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic>\u2019s board at the turn of the century.\nWhile Karl Koechlin Iselin was a director of<italic> Swiss National Bank</italic>, an Iselin married Alfred Sarasin in 1890, who, from 1905, led <italic>Sarasin</italic>, which he made into the largest Swiss private bank, and served as VP of <italic>Swiss National Bank </italic>by the 1920s. His son worked for <italic>Brown</italic> New York before returning to Basel and marrying the American-born Nina Rensselaer Dearth in 1925. \nFrom 1918, a Koechlin cousin led <italic>Geigy</italic> formed a cartel with fellow Swiss chemical firms <italic>Ciba</italic> and <italic>Sandoz</italic> to counter German <italic>Farben</italic>, forming <italic>Cincinnati Chemical Works</italic> in 1930. Koechlins also married into the Seydoux family, who moved from Switzerland to France in the early 19th century and became industrialists and politicians, kinterlinked with the Peugeots and, by 1920, the Schlumbergers. The Schlumbergers had also kinterlinked with the Cazenoves in the 19th century, connecting them to the Genevan <italic>Lombard</italic>, <italic>Hentsch</italic>, and <italic>Candolle Mallet</italic> banker cousinhood. While a Koechlin married <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic>\u2019s Managing Director Charles Dedoux\u2019s son in 1898, Dedoux\u2019s grandson married a Lombard Odier during WWI.\nIn 1910, <italic>Candolle Mallet</italic>\u2019s Guillaume Pictet founded <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re pour Entreprises \u00c9lectriques aux \u00c9tats-Unis</italic> in Geneva to invest Swiss funds in American PUs as a more profitable alternative to railway bonds. In 1912, the company organized <italic>Central States Electric </italic>PUHC to acquire control of <italic>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co</italic>. After WWI, one of GE\u2019s PUHC, led by Christie Hamilton (unrelated to Alex Hamilton), acquired an interest in <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9</italic>, which invested in <italic>Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co</italic> and <italic>North American Co</italic>. \nIn 1925, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9</italic> reorganized as <italic>American European Securities </italic>PUIHC (\u201cAESC\u201d) to raise American capital. Hamilton became VP of AESC, while Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dominic\u00e9 became the Chair. Six of AESC\u2019s eleven directors, including Edmond Aubert, R.L. Hentsch, Aymond Pictet, Jean Lombard, and Albert Lullin of Geneva were represented by <italic>Iselin</italic> in America. Within a year, <italic>Candolle Mallet</italic> adopted the corporate name <italic>Pictet</italic>. \nWhile AESC\u2019s net assets were valued at $8 million in 1927, she raised over $13 million in new capital for investment in PUs within two years. By then, Ernest Tracy became President of AESC. Unrelated to John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife, Tracy\u2019s grandfather was a wealthy Saint-Louis trader and a cousin-in-law of the Harriman family. After graduating from <italic>Yale</italic> in 1907, he worked with <italic>Bonbright</italic>. He later became President and Director of <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s PUIHCs\u2014<italic>US & Foreign Securities </italic>and <italic>US International Securities</italic>\u2014and served as a director for SGE\u2019s foreign PUHC, SGEF, and natural gas HC. \nLikewise, VP Christie Hamilton was a director with <italic>Illuminating & Power Securities Corp</italic>, which was owned by the family of GE President Charles Coffin. At the turn of the century, Coffin\u2019s daughter had married Starling Childs, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and Archibald Campbell, the 1st Marquess of Argyll. Though trained as  lawyer, Childs joined <italic>Bonbright</italic> in 1906.\nPhiladelphia-born William Bonbright had founded <italic>Bonbright</italic> in New York, with London operations by the 1890s. He spent part of his career abroad, and his firm conducted international business. In 1919, France awarded him the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for his assistance to the Allies in WWI. His partners included Anthony Drexel\u2019s grandson John Drexel and Guy Montagu Finch-Hatton, son of the Earl of Winchilsea. Finch-Hatton had married Drexel\u2019s sister in 1911, a year after Drexel\u2019s cousin married Jay Gould\u2019s granddaughter and over a decade since Finch-Hatton\u2019s cousin married a Paget in 1897.\nLandon Thorne was the President of <italic>Bonbright</italic>. He had married a sister of fellow <italic>Bonbright</italic> banker Alfred Loomis. Loomis\u2019 cousin Henry Stimson was John Morgan\u2019s former lawyer and  third cousin once removed had married Harris Livermore, who had led Averell Harriman\u2019s <italic>United American Shipper</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Bonbright</italic> added Sidney Mitch, whose father headed SGE. While SGE increased ownership in her co-founder <italic>Newman</italic> <italic>Saunder</italic>\u2019s <italic>National</italic> PUHC, Paul Saunders soon left <italic>Newman</italic> <italic>Saunder</italic>.\nEarlier, Janet Avery Pomeroy\u2014an extended cousin of Rockefeller\u2019s Avery and <italic>Banker Trusts\u2019</italic> Pomeroy families married\u2014John Dulles. Having fled Irish anti-Protestant repression in 1778, the Dulles family included missionaries, theologians, and clergy. Born in 1888 to a Presbyterian minister and a great-nephew of SBUS President Langdon Cheves, Dulles\u2019 maternal grandfather was President Harrison\u2019s Secretary of State. Along with his brother Allan, John joined <italic>Sullivan</italic>. By 1923, <italic>Sullivan </italic>hired Episcopalian Arthur Dean, who helped Dulles to become the largest law firm in the world and represent American investments in Europe, including <italic>Solvay</italic>, <italic>Farben</italic>, <italic>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</italic>, and the Wertheim cousin-in-law Petschek\u2019s Czech enterprises. \nBy 1929, <italic>Sullivan</italic> hired Henry Wingate, a graduate of <italic>Uni of Michigan</italic> Law. Wingate\u2019s third cousin once removed was a cousin of the Perkins Cushing family and married Horatio Lloyd. Of unknown relation to the London family <italic>Lloyd</italic>, Horatio was born in Philadelphia into a family with a military background and graduated in law from <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic>. He began as a clerk at <italic>Philadelphia Trust</italic>, rose to assistant secretary, then treasurer, VP, and President of <italic>Commercial Trust</italic> in 1902. In 1910, he resigned as president, retained a directorship, and joined <italic>Drexel</italic> as a partner, and soon <italic>Morgan</italic>. His son, Horatio Jr, married a Biddle cousin in 1927 and became a <italic>Drexel</italic> partner in 1929. \nMeanwhile, after hiring <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> cousin Lester Perrin from <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> in 1924, <italic>Lazard </italic>New York added <italic>Guaranty</italic>\u2019s Raymond McGrath of Iowa and George Burr in 1927. Burr\u2019s father William became <italic>Harvard</italic> Professor of Engineering in 1892 and President McKinley\u2019s appointment for the Isthmian Canal Commission in 1899. After graduating <italic>Harvard</italic>, George started at the Boston Brahmin electrical engineering consultancy <italic>Stone Webster</italic> before WWI, joining <italic>Guaranty </italic>in 1916 as a VP.<italic> </italic>\nMatters escalated in 1925 when Altschul, Paul Baerwald, and Raymond McGrath demanded full powers from Senior Partner Blumenthal\u2014Eugene Meyer\u2019s brother-in-law\u2014during his extended spring and summer trip to Europe, Blumenthal departed <italic>Lazard</italic> New York with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Fred Grunebaum, whose father had led <italic>London, Paris, & American Bank</italic> of San Francisco. As Grunebaum\u2019s nephew, Mortimer Grunebaum Fleishhacker, graduated <italic>Uni </italic><italic>of California</italic>, he apprenticed with <italic>Morgan</italic> from late 1927 for a year. Relations continued to sour for several years until the Lazards sued the Fleishhackers for mismanaging their California lands.\nAffiliated with <italic>Warburg</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Schiff for decades, <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt serviced German cities and mechanical engineering, construction industry, and electrical economy sectors. After the war, <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt opened a second branch in Berlin in 1919, deepened ties with her Basel parent, acquired <italic>Landsberg</italic>, and invested in <italic>Reitler</italic> in Vienna in 1921 and founding <italic>Strupp</italic> in New York in 1922. \nAmong <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic>\u2019s new partners who joined during this time were Theodor Vogelstein, whose brother had reorganized <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> America into <italic>American Metal</italic> (\u201c<italic>AMAX</italic>\u201d). Another new partner was Kurt Landsberg, whose wife descended from Samson Wertheim, Paul Wallich, and former <italic>Deutsche </italic>director Werner Mankiewitz, son of <italic>Detusche</italic> board member Paul Mankiewitz. Another <italic>Deutsche</italic> director, Oscar Wassermann, added <italic>Kuhn-</italic>heir Joseph Loeb\u2019s stepson as a co-partner of his <italic>Wassermann</italic> in Berlin in 1926.\nThat year, Paul Warburg hired Massachusetts-born Christian lawyer Hugh Knowlton as VP of <italic>International Acceptance </italic>and soon VP of <italic>International Manhattan</italic>, a security affiliate of <italic>Manhattan </italic>NB. Since Knowlton married GE-heiress Christine Stanley in 1917, Christine\u2019s brother Harold became President of <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>of New York before becoming a <italic>Morgan </italic>partner in 1927 as Dwight Morrow resigned to become Ambassador to Mexico. After warning UST of excessive speculation, Warburg fused <italic>International Acceptance </italic>IHC and <italic>Manhattan </italic>NB in 1928. \nLikewise, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York, Paris, and London invested in and raised funds for <italic>American</italic> <italic>International </italic>IHC and <italic>International Bank of Amsterdam</italic>. One of the few instances of a prominent Christian bank hiring a banker of Jewish descent at this time was when <italic>Lee Higginson</italic> hired the converted aristocrat Gilbert Cah\u00e9n. Born in Paris, he graduated from <italic>Coll\u00e8ge de Normandie</italic> in 1927 and earned an MBA from <italic>Harvard</italic> Business in 1929, when he joined <italic>Lee</italic> until leaving for <italic>Paribas</italic> and Argentina from 1931.\nAs <italic>Morgan </italic>promoted Rockefeller-in-law Henry Davison Jr and Thomas Lamont to Partner in 1929, former lawyer Thomas Gates resigned to lead <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> from 1929 without a salary, while his son Thomas Gates Jr, joined <italic>Morgan</italic>. While Thomas Jr\u2019s first wife died in 1910 after having two children, her brother-in-law became Court Justice by 1930. Moreover, Otto Kahn\u2019s daughter married the son of Thomas Ryan, who had fused <italic>Commerce</italic> NB with LICs and trusts, in 1928. Soon after, <italic>Kuhn</italic> promoted her first non-Jewish partner, Irish Baptist George Bovenizer, who was <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s office boy since 1897. \nAnd, after Avery Stillman Rockefeller joined <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York in 1928, Irish-descendant Gerald Donovan married George Bovenizer\u2019s daughter and became VP of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York in 1929. That year, <italic>Kuhn</italic> promoted her second Christian partner, Baronet William Wiseman, who had joined in 1921 after establishing intelligence contracts with America\u2014through <italic>OIL</italic> co-founder heir and Rockefeller cousin-in-law Gordon Auchincloss and his father-in-law Colonel Edward House\u2014and then married an extended cousin of John Morgan in 1925.\nAmong the earliest, however, was <italic>Goldman</italic> <italic>Lehman.</italic> While <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> promoted the New England Christian William Bowers of Massachusetts to manage <italic>Goldman</italic> <italic>Lehman</italic> Chicago from 1915 as Katz-in-law Paul Goldman Sachs retired to join academia. As Harry Goldman retired during WWI for supporting Germany, <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> hired Tennessee-born Christian Waddill Catchings formerly affiliated with <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Export </italic>department. By 1925, Catchings hired Albert Gordon, a <italic>Harvard</italic> Business educated Catholic whose father became wealthy supplying the British Army leather in WWI.\nCatchings soon promoted Sidney Weinberg from an assistant to the firm\u2019s Black janitor to partner. While Weinberg\u2019s large family was too poor to secure an education, they taught him the \u2018hustle.\u2019 His father, Pincus, was one of the first residents of East Midwood, Brooklyn, and was a local civic, democratic, and religious leader. So were his siblings and mother, who presided over a Jewish women\u2019s organization. While Pincus was a stock option specialist at <italic>Filer</italic>, his soon became a partner at <italic>Andrews Posner</italic> Curb, a specialist for stocks trading on the over-the-counter <italic>New York Curb Exchange</italic>, and his daughter wed a City Court Justice.\nSince Julius Rosenwald\u2019s daughter Edith married a Sulzberger, <italic>Sears </italic>tapped Sulzberger-in-law <italic>Becker</italic> for bond financing in 1919. The following year, however, Edith divorced and married a Lehman cousin. Long<italic> </italic>dominating CP, <italic>Goldman</italic> <italic>Lehman</italic> financing corporate and PU bonds since 1909, and established dedicated corporate and municipal departments after the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic> in 1922. By then Joseph Sachs\u2019 daughters wed <italic>Sears</italic>\u2019 Hammerslough Rosenwald and <italic>Macy</italic>\u2019s Straus heirs, allowing <italic>Goldman</italic> <italic>Lehman</italic> to service <italic>Sears, Macy</italic>, <italic>Gimble</italic>, <italic>May</italic>, <italic>Allied</italic>, and other chain and department stores to tap NYSE to grow. Already in-laws of Seligman and Guggenheim, <italic>Gimble </italic>also kinterlinked with <italic>Newman Saunders</italic> of New York and <italic>Gerstle Sunstein</italic> of Philadelphia.\nIncreasingly, they faced competition from <italic>Merrill</italic>, which took <italic>Safeway</italic>, <italic>K-mart</italic>, <italic>JC Penney</italic>, and forerunners of <italic>Winn-Dixie</italic> public. After Jewish Clarence Housman retired from <italic>Housman</italic>, Protestant partner Edward Pierce soon merged with <italic>Merrill</italic>. Beginning with <italic>Famous Players-Lasky</italic> and <italic>Wilson</italic> in 1919, <italic>Hallgarten</italic> headed or held a key position in numerous underwriting syndicates for industrial security issues, including <italic>American Metal</italic> (1922), <italic>Briggs Manufacturing</italic> (1926), <italic>Columbian Carbon</italic> (1923), <italic>Commercial Credit</italic> (1929), <italic>Curtis Publishing</italic> (1923, 1925, 1926), and many others.\nWhile Philip Lehman grew concerned about upbeat economic forecasts from Waddill Catchings\u2019 <italic>Pollak Foundation for Economic Research</italic>, Sidney Weinberg grew impatient with Lehman. By 1924, <italic>Lehman</italic> left <italic>Goldman</italic>. Hired that year as <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s first non-Jew and non-family member, John Hancock led financing for <italic>Kroger </italic>and other grocery retailing chains as well as food processors. Lehman\u2019s daughter (and granddaughter of mining magnate Adolph Lewisohn) married the son of <italic>AMAX</italic>\u2019s Carl Loeb and Alabama\u2019s Adeline Moses in 1926. <italic>Kuhn</italic> heir Frederick Warburg joined <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1927. \nThat year, <italic>Hallgarten</italic> alums Maurice Wertheim and Joseph Klingenstein joined several others to establish broker <italic>Wertheim</italic> and moved to merge <italic>Underwood Typewriter Co</italic> with <italic>Elliott-Fisher Co</italic>, backed by <italic>Chase</italic> NB\u2019s Albert Wiggin and <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>\u2019s Charles Hayden. Of unknown relation to Samson Wertheim, Maurice Wertheim had led <italic>United Cigar</italic> and married a daughter of real estate tycoon Henry Morgenthau Sr\u2019s in 1909. As Wertheim joined <italic>Hallgarten</italic> in 1911, <italic>Goldman Lehman </italic>underwrote <italic>United Cigar</italic>, and took <italic>Underwood Typewriter</italic>\u2014with Morgenthau as a Director\u2014public in 1910. In 1916, Morgenthau\u2019s son, Henry Jr, wed Elinor Lehman Fatman, cousin-in-law of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Rheims family. \nMeanwhile, New York merchant heir Joseph Klingenstein joined <italic>Hallgarten </italic>in 1911 after graduating <italic>Columbia Uni</italic> and his cousin, real estate heir Benjamin Buttenwieser, joined <italic>Kuhn</italic> in 1918.<italic> </italic>Since <italic>Hallgarten</italic> heiress Adele Neustadt married <italic>Kuhn</italic> heir Mortimer Schiff in 1900, and <italic>Heidelbach Ickelheimer</italic> heir Henry Ickelheimer married Robert Lehman\u2019s sister four years later, Adele Neustadt\u2019s nephew, the son of <italic>Hallgarten</italic>\u2019s senior partner, married Jean Lehman Ickelheimer at a Presbyterian Church in 1928. After Buttenwieser gained power of attorney at <italic>Kuhn</italic> that year, he married Adolph Lewisohn\u2019s Lehman granddaughter, whose sister married a <italic>Wertheim</italic> partner.\nAs TA1926 spurred hostile takeovers to gain control for tax incentives, <italic>Mellon</italic> linked the Eaton and <italic>Lehman</italic> PUHCs. As Eaton started <italic>Continental</italic> IHC in 1926, <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> launched <italic>General American</italic> IHC in 1927. Without control, Insull led federated PUs, financing expansion via inter-firm loans, as large PU\u2019s shares floated freely without tax consolidation. When <italic>Continental </italic>increased<italic> </italic>purchases in 1927, Insull\u2019s operators sought aid. Only from 1928 did <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Seligman</italic> start IHCs\u2014led by Christians Waddill Catchings and Earlie Bailie, respectively\u2014 as <italic>Harriman</italic> popularized control-less mutual fund IHCs.\nSince PUHCs raised more capital than banks, FA1927 allowed banks to pay dividends, fostering <italic>bank</italic> <italic>HCs</italic> (\u201cBHCs\u201d). BHCs sold securities they underwrote to subsidiary insurers and investors via IHCs. As AA1914 exempted non-urban banks, NBs gave up their charters and formed BHCs using TA1928\u2019s tax-free reorgs. On the other hand, Cleveland\u2019s <italic>Union Trust</italic> organized BHCs and affiliated companies to manage investments and foreclosed assets, giving tight control to bank directors while insulating them from liability. While BIHCs in Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, and Minnesota bought rural SBs, several diverse bankers emerged. Among the two of the most religiously diverse BHCs were the West\u2019s<italic> Bank of Italy</italic> NB and <italic>First Security</italic> BHC. \nSince David Eccles immigrated from Scottish to Utah in 1863, he converted to Mormonism and married Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s stepson\u2019s wife\u2019s first cousin.  Reclaiming his firm after the Court dissolved <italic>SUGAR</italic> in 1911, Eccles amassed one of the West\u2019s largest family fortunes by 1912, with investments in <italic>Utah Construction</italic>, <italic>Amalgamated Sugar</italic>, and two banks. Expanding their investments to five banks in 1926, David\u2019s sons Marriner and George Eccles grew their holdings to seventeen banks and one building and loan company by 1928, when they consolidated their financials into <italic>First Security</italic> BHC.\nAP Giannini and Italian-American fruit traders founded <italic>Bank of Italy</italic> NB in 1904, overtaking competitors by 1919. Bank mergers accelerated in California after the <italic>Panic of 1920 </italic>as the state extended pro-rata liability to out-of-state shareholders. Since Orra Monnett\u2014a grandson of Ohio banker Abraham Monnett and son of California banker Mervin Monnett\u2014joined his father\u2019s <italic>Citizens</italic> NB in Los Angeles in 1907, he co-founded <italic>Bank of America</italic>, Los Angeles, in 1923, and merged with <italic>Bank of Italy</italic> in 1924. By 1929, <italic>Bank of Italy</italic>\u2019s Giannini formed <italic>TransAmerica</italic><italic> </italic>BHC and bought Nathan Jonas\u2019 <italic>Bank of America</italic> in New York (without <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic>) and proceeded to buy<italic> </italic><italic>Bowery & East River </italic>and <italic>Commercial Exchange </italic>banks. \nAs Southern Protestant Catchings became President of <italic>Goldman</italic> and owned most of her equity, he launched <italic>Goldman </italic>IHC in 1928, with investors including <italic>Sullivan</italic> lawyer and Rockefeller extended cousin-in-law John Dulles. By 1928, Sidney Weinberg arranged Catching\u2019s <italic>Goldman</italic> IHC sale and <italic>Lehman</italic> to gain control of <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> from the Jonas\u2019 <italic>Financial & Industrial Securities</italic> BHC. In 1929, <italic>Abraham Straus</italic>, <italic>Filene</italic>, and several other Jewish department stores merged into <italic>Federated Department Stores</italic> under Filene leadership with Lehman and <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Macy</italic> in-laws becoming directors. <italic>Bloomingdale</italic> joined <italic>Federated</italic> by 1930.\nJews owned major New York department stores, including <italic>Macy</italic>, <italic>Gimbel</italic>, <italic>Saks</italic>, <italic>Abraham Straus</italic>, <italic>Bloomingdale</italic>, <italic>Hearn</italic>, with exceptions like <italic>Stern</italic>, <italic>Wanamaker</italic>, <italic>McCreery</italic>, <italic>Loeser</italic>, <italic>Lord Taylor</italic>, and <italic>Best</italic>. While major department store chains like <italic>May</italic>, <italic>Allied</italic>, <italic>Interstate</italic>, <italic>Gimbel</italic> were Jewish, chains like <italic>Woolworth</italic> and <italic>Kress</italic> were mostly non-Jewish. Outside of several cities, Jews were a minority nationwide. In Chicago, Christians managed<italic> Montgomery Ward</italic>, <italic>Marshall Field</italic>, and <italic>Carson Pirie</italic>, Jewish rooted <italic>Sears</italic> came under non-Jewish leadership. While 90% of drugstores and 95-99% of food and grocery chains, including A&P, were non-Jewish, apparel-store chains were 90% Jewish-owned.\n did not account for chain stores, which tapped the capital markets, unlike CP-issuing predecessors. Since UST monopolized banknotes during the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Congress allowed states to tax only NBs\u2019 shares and real estate, but no more than other corporations. After the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, Congress allowed states to switch NB taxation to net income or dividends in 1923. Net income taxes made tax-free UST and municipals more attractive, accelerating credit deflation. So, Congress expanded to all income. As New York and California shifted from corporate dividends to net income taxes, dividends grew, but NBs switched to SBs. FA1927 also eased NB-SB mergers to clip this trend, setting off NB acquisitions of SBs. \nAlthough FA1927 permitted NBs to branch per state law, only New York, California, and several states did. The biggest beneficiary of this law was Giannini\u2019s <italic>TransAmerica</italic>, which bought Brooklyn\u2019s<italic> Nassau </italic>NB and <italic>Traders</italic> NB and the private investment banking house of <italic>Blair</italic>, soon appointing Elisha Walk as Chair and his friend Jean Monnet board Vice Chair. Other NBs, particularly <italic>Chase</italic>, focused on international growth. \nThe McGarrah family, originally of Scottish descent, settled in America around 1781, and became merchants in Upstate, New York. Born in Monroe, Gates McGarrah began banking in Goshen and then moved to New York City, becoming Cashier of <italic>Leather</italic> NB in 1898. After co-founding <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> in 1903, McGarrah merged his bank with <italic>Mechanics</italic> NB in 1904 and became President. \nBy 1910, he merged with <italic>Metals</italic> NB and joined the Board of the enlarged <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>, and then bought <italic>Fourth</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> and <italic>Produce Exchange Bank </italic>in 1922. During this time, he became a director of FRS <italic>New York</italic>. Succeeding McGarrah as President in 1922, John McHugh started with <italic>Grand Trunk</italic> RR, then moved to banking with <italic>State Bank of O\u2019Neill</italic> in 1898 until he became President of <italic>Iowa State</italic> NB and joined McGarrah\u2019s bank in 1915. \nAs McHugh\u2019s daughter married Gerald Beal in 1923, Beal became Treasurer of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York and McGarrah joined the board of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York and, the following year, become the American member of <italic>German Reichsbank</italic>\u2019s (\u201cGRB\u201d) Advisory Council and <italic>Dawes Plan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Reparations Commission</italic><italic>.</italic> By 1926, they acquired <italic>Chase</italic> NB. Keeping the <italic>Chase</italic> brand, McHugh and McGarrah became President and Chair, respectively. In early 1927, McGarrah resigned to join FRS <italic>New York</italic> Governor Strong as Chair, elevating McHugh up to Chair of <italic>Chase</italic>, with Albert Wiggin as President. \nWiggin added James Lee as a director. Unrelated to <italic>Lee</italic> <italic>Higginson</italic>, Lee had constructed luxury New York apartments. The same year, Lee\u2019s daughter married a son of prominent LIC attorney Vernon Bouvier, whose aunt had wed the Catholic brother of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s partner Anthony Drexel. Before Wiggin joined <italic>Chase</italic> and co-founded <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> in 1903, he was as VP of <italic>National Park Bank</italic>, which gained a new president. Charles McCain, the son of an Arkansas lawyer, began banking at 13 and, at 20, became Cashier of a bank in McGehee in 1904. As <italic>Missouri</italic> RR sought to pass through the town, McCain founded a bank before a competitor could. In 1926, he moved North to become VP of <italic>National Park Bank</italic>, and in 1927, became President. \nAlong with the <italic>Dawes Plan </italic>to ease German reparations, FRS eased rates for Britain to rejoin the gold standard. While withdrawing GRB discounting, GRS limited municipal treasurers access to raising capital on NYSE, squeezing PU-owning municipalities amidst coal and <italic>mark</italic> inflation. Federalizing taxes, GRS reduced spending and taxed foreign bondholders in 1926. Credit crashed as GRB decreased rates but refused to discount for banks lending on security collateral in 1927. \nFA1927 allowed NBs to invest in liquid debt, but not stocks. As foreigners tapped NYSE for cheap funds, they held some of the proceeds in the NYSE<italic> collateral loan money market</italic> (\u201cMMSEC\u201d). American bankers lobbied Congress to make German and French securities negotiable per local law to unite cross-Atlantic collateral money markets and reduce the need for gold exchange. While Anglo-American practice required registered certificates to transfer ownership, European used lower tax bearer securities. As NYSE allowed bankers to sell foreign securities in late 1927, <italic>Brown</italic> and <italic>Barney</italic> sold shares of <italic>Dutch East Indies Co </italic>successor <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>. \nLikewise, <italic>International Acceptance Bank</italic>, <italic>Goldman</italic>, and Germano-Swiss <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic>\u2019s affiliates<italic> Ames Emerich</italic>, <italic>Strupp </italic>of New York, and <italic>Reitler</italic> of Vienna, sold shares of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>. At the same time, all three <italic>Lazard</italic> houses invested in and raised funds for <italic>American</italic> <italic>International </italic>IHC and <italic>International Bank of Amsterdam</italic>.<italic> Lazard </italic>also formed a partnership with <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic>. That year, since raising capital from <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Solvay</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Creusot</italic>\u2019s Schneider, Vienna\u2019s <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic>  acquired <italic>Union Bank of Bohemia</italic> and <italic>Allgemeine Verkehrsbank</italic>. Since Eugene Schneider joined <italic>\u00d6sterreichische</italic>\u2019s board in 1924, the latter merged with <italic>Union Bank of Bohemia</italic> led their Polish affiliates\u2014<italic>Bank Ma</italic><italic>l</italic><italic>opolski</italic> and <italic>Union Bank of </italic><italic>Poland</italic>\u2014to merge under Chair Janusz Radziwill, whose cousin married a Wendel that year.\nAt the same time, America monetized bankers\u2019 acceptances, FRS lengthened the discount terms and Congress eliminated taxes on acceptances held by central banks with . So, foreign creditors ran to secured <italic>dollar</italic> credits as banks transformed taxable MMSEC trades into tax-free deposit accounts. In 1927, <italic>Chase </italic>negotiated a $20 million loan for <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, which made loans to German firms, and in 1928, partnered with <italic>Chase</italic> to form <italic>General Mortgage & Credit Corp</italic> to promote foreign investment in Germany. By 1929, <italic>Commerzbank</italic> acquired <italic>Mitteldeutsche Credit</italic>, with the latter\u2019s Albert Katz becoming Deputy Chair of the combined entity. Soon after, <italic>Commerzbank</italic> merged brewers <italic>Schultheiss-Patzenhofer </italic>and <italic>Ostwerke</italic>, which retained <italic>Danat</italic> representation.  \nLow FRS rates also attracted Japan. Since the 1923 earthquake, Japan\u2019s government guaranteed private debt up to a certain level. However, when debt issues exceeded that level in 1927, creditors started to withdraw their investments from bonds. In April, the Privy Council rejected relief for <italic>Bank of Taiwan</italic>, triggering its closure, the bankruptcy of her client <italic>Suzuki</italic>, the collapse of the cabinet, nationwide bank shutdowns, a 20-day payments moratorium.\nAs over thirty banks, including <italic>Bank of Taiwan</italic>, <italic>Fifteenth Bank</italic>, and <italic>Bank of Omi</italic>, suspended,  the government reorganized <italic>Bank of Taiwan</italic> and BOJ authorized special and extraordinary advances and banned small banks. So, mergers reduced banks from 1,417 in 1926 to 876 in 1929. This also concentrated zaibatsu, with <italic>Mitsui</italic> purchasing <italic>Suzuki</italic>\u2019s sugar assets, and ending Yone Suzuki\u2019s reign as the world\u2019s most powerful woman. \nLikewise, Japan waived the legal limit on foreign borrowing for electric utilities, doubling existing debt. As <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, and <italic>Dillon</italic> helped zaibatsu tap NYSE and the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> to consolidate debts,<italic> Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Arthur Dean negotiated Japan\u2019s first open-end mortgage via <italic>Harris Forbes</italic>. PUs issued nearly two-thirds of Japan\u2019s corporate bonds held in America. Along with European panics, FRS further eased rates in 1927. As the <italic>franc</italic> stabilized, MOF allowed firms to make foreign investments. Belgium followed by granting tax relief to local BHCs to invest in foreign banks and PUHCs. \nCritics worried branches fostered MMSEC. Yet even without inter-state branching, banks and securities affiliates linked markets using regional exchanges and NYSE. As MMSEC distributed collateral loans, large securities developed a premium. TA1928 also allowed\u2014as long as there was control\u2014for tax-free reorg mergers and eased AA1914 regulated HC growth. So, PUs issues accounted for a third of IHCs and total securities issued as they drove stock market activity with reorgs and mergers. To protect his PUs from <italic>Continental</italic>, Insull and <italic>Stuart</italic> shifted preferred dividends from cash to stock and listed a PUIHC in Chicago. \nWith Chicago\u2019s MMSEC money market on par with Paris\u2014behind only New York, London, and Berlin\u2014banks such as Charles Dawes\u2019 <italic>Central Trust</italic> bought Insull\u2019s securities to pledge for loans. Despite controlling GE and AT&T\u2019s finances, <italic>Morgan </italic>held few PU assets across her interlocked directorates. For example, the Philadelphia office held <italic>GAS</italic> shares from the 1880s. After <italic>Morgan </italic>expanded her <italic>GAS</italic> stake in 1926, <italic>GAS</italic> and SGE signed to connect power from Pennsylvania to Maryland in 1927. After the SGE spin-off, GE held <italic>Mohawk-Niagara Power</italic> shares. \nHowever, Governor Al Smith blocked <italic>Buffalo-Niagara Power</italic>\u2014controlled by Mellon\u2019s <italic>ALUM</italic>, <italic>DuPont</italic>, and GE\u2014from developing hydroelectricity on the Canadian border. As Mellon bought New York City\u2019s<italic> Consolidated Gas</italic> shares in 1927, <italic>ALUM</italic> spun-off foreign bauxite and hydroelectric assets to her Canadian subsidiary to control production in 1928. \nBy 1929, GE sold <italic>Mohawk-Niagara</italic> to <italic>Morgan</italic>, who in turn<italic> </italic>combined her assets and <italic>Buffalo-Niagara Power </italic>and <italic>Northeastern Power</italic> to form <italic>Niagara Hudson </italic>PUHC, chaired by Floyd Carlisle. Likewise, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Mellon</italic>, <italic>Bonbright</italic>, <italic>Carlisle</italic>, and <italic>Clark</italic> combined their shares into NYSE-listed <italic>United </italic>PUIHC as they interlinked directorates. Sensing bidding wars, banks formed PUIHCs to acquire PUs, many used TA1928\u2019s tax-free reorgs. Competition for PU operating companies accelerated as New York allowed saving banks and LICs to hold preferred shares. \nLikewise, bankers consolidated their financial interests. In 1929, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Oswego</italic> merged with <italic>Second</italic> NB <italic>of Oswego</italic>, both founded in 1864, to form <italic>First </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Second</italic> NB of Oswego, the city\u2019s only NB, with <italic>Carlisle </italic>President Floyd Carlisle as a director. The same year, Mellon hired Frank Denton, an NB examiner, to lead <italic>Mellon</italic> NB. Denton was born near Arkansas City, Kansas. While his Swiss-born great-grandfather immigrated as an Episcopal missionary, Denton\u2019s father Albert graduated from high school in 1891, worked as a farmer, and joined <italic>Farmers</italic> NB in 1893 as a clerk. He became cashier and sold his interest in 1907. In 1909, he bought <italic>Home</italic> NB and became President and soon directed SGE-owned <italic>Kansas Gas & Electric </italic>PUHC. \nFollowing Insull\u2019s example, <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic> reorganized <italic>Stone Webster</italic>\u2019s PUHC from 1909 into a Delaware HC in 1926. While Bayard Pope led <italic>Stone Webster</italic>\u2019s securities division <italic>Blodget</italic> from 1926, his brother Allan became President of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic>\u2019s security affiliate in 1928. The following year, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic>\u2019s security affiliate merged with <italic>Old Colony Trust</italic><italic> </italic>of Boston, which had been founded by the deceased Thomas Coolidge\u2014a descendant of President Thomas Jefferson and Boston Brahmin\u2014and helped form GE and AT&T, under Pope. That year, <italic>Stone Webster Blodget</italic>, <italic>White Weld</italic>, <italic>Barney</italic>, and <italic>Schoellkopf Hutton Pomeroy</italic> formed <italic>Marine Midland</italic> BHC, including, acquired sixteen Upstate New York banks. \nFor President, <italic>Marine Midland </italic>elected George Rand. The son of the former Chair of <italic>Marine Trust</italic>, Rand had married an extend cousin of John Morgan. He became a director of <italic>Remington Rand</italic><italic> </italic>after his cousin merged with <italic>Rand </italic>machines with Rockefeller-in-law Marcellus Hartley Dodge\u2019s <italic>Remington </italic>and other competitors to form <italic>Remington Rand</italic> in 1927. For her Chair, <italic>Marine Midland</italic> retained Ernest Stauffen of the <italic>Morgan</italic>-affiliated <italic>New York Trust</italic>. Stauffen\u2019s brother-in-law Kentucky-born Louis Stewart was a <italic>New York Trust</italic> VP and wed to a Vermilye descendant, from whose family bank <italic>Dillion</italic> formed.\nLikewise, <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> hired Warren Gatchell. While Gatchell married a Montgomery\u2014third cousin of <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic>\u2019s John Montgomery and part of a family distantly connected to the Roosevelt and Payne Whitney lines\u2014his third cousin had married <italic>Morgan</italic> cousin Charles Tracy Barney\u2019s daughter. <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s connections with Boston deepened after WWI. \nEdward Whitney joined. Edward\u2019s brother was president of a Boston bank and built an India trade fortune. Unlike most <italic>Morgan </italic>bankers who brought family units, Edward was a bachelor and brought his nephews, George and Richard. While George joined <italic>Morgan </italic>by 1907, Richard joined<italic> Kidder</italic> before he moved to New York and formed <italic>Whitney </italic>in 1910. During WWI, George grew at <italic>Morgan </italic>while Richard worked in Washington under Hoover. As George made <italic>Morgan </italic>partner in 1919, Richard\u2019s <italic>Whitney</italic> became <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s stockbroker. \nAs Massachusetts had prohibited corporations from holding real estate before 1922, investors innovated <italic>trusts</italic>. With regulatory legislation dealing with control, <italic>trusts</italic> allowed for diversified investment in land, operating mills, and utilities. So, while <italic>Russell Forbes</italic>-descendant Allan Forbes presided over <italic>State Street Trust</italic>, Boston Brahmin Paul Cabot married Virginia Converse\u2014sister-in-law of Junius Morgan II\u2014and founded America\u2019s first mutual fund, <italic>State Street Investment Corp</italic>. Paul\u2019s cousin Thomas Lowell Cabot, meanwhile, expanded his father\u2019s <italic>Cabot</italic> petrochemicals across the Southwest, developing natural gas uses. Since Junius II\u2019s brother Henry married his daughter in 1923, CF Adams became Hoover\u2019s Secretary of the Navy in 1929. \nWhile <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s stockbroker, <italic>Whitney</italic> led by Richard Whitney secretly embezzled from <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s estate to cover his loses from 1923, his brother George controlled <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s directorates out of the public eye. While Richard served honorarily as NYSE\u2019s VP, he responded to President Coolidge\u2019s instructions, and publicly called for restraint in March 1929. Serving successive NYSE President terms, Richard Wall Street\u2019s voice. \nAs <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> moved to merge with NB <italic>of Commerce</italic> in early 1929, <italic>Dillon </italic>Partner James Forrestal balanced <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s influence by organizing the merger of <italic>Chase</italic> NB and <italic>National Park Bank </italic>in June, with McCain as President and Wiggin as Chair. Having expanded to Europe under Wiggin since 1927 to become America\u2019s leading lender to Germany, <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s securities affiliate acquired <italic>American Express</italic> in July 1929, gaining a foothold in China. \nSince becoming a Director of <italic>Chase</italic>, Elgood Lufkin\u2014a son of <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s engineer\u2014served as Chair of <italic>Texaco</italic> until retiring in 1926. By 1929, his son married the daughter of <italic>Edison</italic>\u2019s Thomas Murray and widow of <italic>McDonnell</italic>\u2019s John McDonnell. Competition also broke marriages. Since <italic>TransAmerica</italic> acquired <italic>Blair</italic>, a daughter of <italic>Blair</italic> divorced John Morgan\u2019s grandson Pierpont Morgan Hamilton for cruelty in 1929.  \nAround the same time, GE\u2019s Owen Young, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Thomas Lamont, <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s Baron John Baring, and BDF Governor \u00c9mile Moreau joined to mediate the <italic>Young Plan</italic> to ease the burden of reparations payments on Germany. While <italic>Lazard</italic> London was heavily involved, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Andr\u00e9 Meyer represented French bankers in forming <italic>Bank for International Settlements</italic> (\u201cBIS\u201d) with <italic>Chase</italic> NB\u2019s Gates McGarrah as President. There, Meyer befriended <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s Eberstadt, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>\u2019s Mannheimer, and <italic>Danat</italic>\u2019s Goldsmith as they created inter-national fund movement. With the <italic>Young Plan</italic>, PUIHCs drove half of foreign investment. \nSince WWI, Belgian HCs helped rebuild Europe, particularly in industries formerly led by Germans.  Back in 1915, Eugene Meyer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Orlando Weber reorganized <italic>Maxwell Motor</italic>. Joining Meyer at <italic>War Finance Corp</italic> during WWI, Weber became interested in the chemical industry, and soon managed <italic>National Aniline & Chemical Co</italic>. As Meyer and Weber advocated for American competitiveness against Germany, <italic>Allied Chemical & Dye Corp</italic> formed in 1920 with Belgian <italic>Solvay</italic> as a merger of five companies: <italic>General Chemical </italic>acids (founded 1899), <italic>Solvay Process Co </italic>alkalis (1881), <italic>Barrett Co</italic> coal tar (1858), and <italic>National Aniline & Chemical Co</italic> nitrogen (1917). \nWith Weber as President, <italic>General Chemical Co</italic>\u2019s William Nichols as Chair, <italic>Allied Chemical</italic> became a major player in the industry. Since San Francisco-born <italic>Wallac</italic><italic>k</italic><italic> Cook</italic> lawyer Alfred Cook advised Adolph Ochs\u2019 purchase of <italic>New York Times</italic> in 1896 and served as Counsel, he married Eugene Meyer\u2019s sister in 1902, and served as a director of <italic>Allied Chemical</italic>, one of the few American Jews in the chemicals sector in the 1930s.\nBack in 1904, Germany\u2019s GGE bought UEG and acquired PUHC (\u201cBGGE\u201d), which hired Dannie Heineman, born in Charlotte, North Carolina, to a Jewish American father and Jewish German. After his father died, Dannie grew up in Hanover, Germany, and required grants for college. He joined UEG in Berlin and worked on electrification projects across Europe. In 1905, he became the Managing Director of BGGE in Brussels, which he grew into a global player in electric production and distribution. With backing from Belgian banks and German institutions like <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Dresdner</italic>. By 1910, Heineman wed Hettie Meyer of Hanover, a Katz Frankel descendant of Samuel Oppenheim and cousin of Chief Rabbi of Britain Nathan Adler.\nSince <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> and other banks financed Russian tramway and electricity firms before WWI, which traded on <italic>Brussels Stock Exchange</italic>, business continued in lands lost by the Soviet Union, including Poland, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Romanian Bessarabia. In 1928, <italic>Lambert</italic> heir Henri Rothschild Lambert married Johanna Reininghaus, from a family of Catholic Austrian industrialists and converted Jews associated with <italic>Wiener</italic>. \nLikewise, Goudchaux Halphen-in-law Franz Philippson passed leadership of <italic>Philippson </italic>to his son Jules. Since Jules married a Mocatta, their daughter married a Weisweiller-cousin descended from Samson Wertheim in 1926. By 1927, Jules\u2019 cousin married Katz-cousin Emile Lazard Fould kinterlinked. Within a year, <italic>Philippson</italic>, SG<italic> Belge</italic>, <italic>Paribas </italic>Brussels, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, <italic>Lambert</italic>, and <italic>Anglo-South American Bank</italic> partnered with <italic>Solvay</italic> to create <italic>Finabel</italic> to consolidate Belgian industrial and financial interests. \nThe same year, Since the former <italic>Bank of Tarapaca</italic> became the largest British overseas bank, <italic>Anglo-South</italic>\u2019s Paris branch was under the leadership of Charles Poirson. Poirson\u2019s father Alfred Oppermann an administrator of <italic>Works of Marseille </italic>oil subsidiary and a former <italic>Parisienne</italic> director, whose father was a director of BDF <italic>Marseille</italic>. In 1929, <italic>Transatlantique</italic><italic> </italic>absorbed <italic>Anglo-South</italic>\u2019s Paris branch and Poirson joined  <italic>Transatlantique</italic>\u2019s board. \nSince <italic>Banca Commercial Italiana</italic>\u2019s Giuseppe Toeplitz formed <italic>Italian Superpower </italic>PUIHC in 1928, SGE gained control by 1929. SGE bought PUs from <italic>Tata </italic>in India, <italic>Lazard </italic>London in Mexico and Chile, and<italic> Atlas </italic>in Argentina. Having started<italic> Atlas</italic> PUIHC in 1923 with his friend George Howard, Floyd Odlum, a son of a Methodist minister then led SGE as Howard presided over <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>United</italic> PUIHC from 1929. <italic>Lazard</italic> London joined <italic>Morgan </italic>and IGE in expanding SGE to Japan. \nLikewise, <italic>Italian Superpower </italic>PUIHC funded <italic>Union d\u2019Electricit\u00e9 </italic>PUHC. Albert Petsche and Ernest Mercier\u2019s <italic>Union d\u2019Electricit\u00e9</italic> introduced hydroelectric power to Paris in 1926 through a new subsidiary with <italic>Paris-Orleans</italic> RR. Funded primarily by Swiss <italic>Indelec</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Parisienne</italic>. In 1927, Mercier married Marguerite Dreyfu\u00df, the widow of Adolphe Reinach, niece of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df. Alfred Dreyfu\u00df\u2019 son was married to Rachel Bauer, a niece of Andr\u00e9 Meyer\u2019s deceased brother-in-law Edouard Weil of <italic>Bauer</italic>. \nSince <italic>Dreyfu\u00df </italic>Basel invested in Koechlin-in-law\u2019s <italic>Franco-Swiss Bank</italic> 1894, the bank Formed <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'\u00c9lectricit\u00e9</italic> alongside <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Lehideux</italic> in 1898. Following WWI, the bank restructured as <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic> in 1917, and added Mercier, and, following the absorption of <italic>Banque de Mulhouse </italic>in 1928, Jean Lantz, as directors. From 1920<italic>, </italic> Roger Lehideux served on the boards of <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, and <italic>Nationale</italic>. Likewise, the grandson of <italic>Lyonnais</italic> founder Henri Germain married a niece of Rothschild\u2019s cousin May Ephrussi and the Prince of Lucinge in 1928.\n<italic>Union d\u2019Electricit\u00e9</italic> PUHC also received investment from <italic>Rothchild</italic> Paris, working closely with Rene Mayer and Paul Eschwege, who represented the French Rothschilds in the electrical industry. While Esther Lazard was Rene Mayer\u2019s third cousin once removed through Aron, Cerf, and Dupont, she married his third cousin Ren\u00e9 Fould in 1900. \nA grandson of the Deputy Chief Rabbi of Paris, Mayer\u2019s Dupont mother made him a fifth cousin once removed of Marguerite Dreyfu\u00df and fourth cousin of Andr\u00e9 Meyer, whose grandmother was a Dreyfu\u00df Cerf. Since the children of his father\u2019s brother wed a Lazard and Weill, Mayer married a descendant of Cerf Berr, and his Goudchaux descendant Dupont mother\u2019s brother married a Worms and their daughter wed a Weisweiller Rothschild by 1927. Now the nephew of a Rothschild, Mayer became a Director of <italic>Nord</italic> RHC in 1928 and Board VP by 1932. In between, he represented <italic>Rothchild</italic> Paris. \nEschwege\u2014a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Aleppo Sciama, through whom he was a Dupont cousin, and the Goudchaux Chief Rabbi of Metz Guggenheim, making him a Halphen and Rothschild cousin\u2014had wed Nathalie Rapha\u00ebl in 1898, whose second cousins married a Sassoon and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 David Weill around the same time. Likewise, he was related to Joseph Sciama, co-founder of <italic>Suez Canal</italic>, and the Foas. The Foa family, originally from Italy, established roots in France in the 18th century with Solomon Foa, who settled in Bordeaux, and whose son received permission from the parliament of Navarre in 1787 to settle in Pau. \nLater generations included Hippolyte Gradis Rodrigues\u2019 brother-in-law as well as Raoul Foa, a partner in the bill discounting firm <italic>King Foa</italic> and a director of <italic>British Bank of South America</italic> and <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic>, where he became Chair in 1918. A year earlier, his daughter married Katz descendant Philip Waley Henriques, Hannah Cohen-Barent Rothschild\u2019s third great nephew. When <italic>Barclay</italic> took over <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic>, <italic>Colonial Bank</italic> of the West Indies, and <italic>South African</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, Foa became Deputy Chair of the colonial bank BHC.\nIn 1929, Mercier\u2019s daughter married Wilfrid Baumgartner. <italic>Mirabaud</italic>-cousin Baumgartner graduated from the <italic>\u00c9cole des Sciences Politiques</italic> in 1925, ranked first in the competitive exams for the Inspector of Finance, and became administrative chief to Finance Minister Paul Reynaud. From 1929, he was Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry\u2019s General Movement of Funds, the equivalent of UST Assistant Secretary.\nSince <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> included the Christian Pastre family of Marseilles and Goldschmidt kinterlinked and Katz-descendant Suzanne Gunzburg Fould wed Bordeaux shipper Raoul Gradis in 1888,<italic> </italic>Simon Lazard\u2019s daughter wed Ren\u00e9 Dupont Fould after his iron magnate father Alphonse Fould<italic> </italic>took <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> public in 1898. Ren\u00e9\u2019s uncle, Salomon Halfon, Eug\u00e8ne Pereire\u2019s son-in-law, secured Ren\u00e9 boards seats at <italic>Penho\u00ebt</italic> shipyard and <italic>Transatlantique Shipping & Bank</italic>, which separated from shipping into an investment bank. \nThese families were involved in<italic> Works of Marseille </italic>PUHC, founded in 1891 by <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> and <italic>Transatlantique </italic>for sanitation work in Marseille, began power plant construction in 1898, helped create <italic>Electrique du Littoral M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en </italic>with GE-linked<italic> French Thomson Houston</italic>, and became France\u2019s leading public works company by 1908. From 1923 to 1927, <italic>Electrique du Littoral </italic>secured capital through syndicates formed by banks like <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, and others. \nGabriel Cordier was appointed Director of <italic>Electrique du Littoral</italic> in 1904 and became President in 1906. Starting his career in Toulon and Marseille and became Chief Engineer of Operations at <italic>Code l\u2019Ouest</italic>, he was involved with <italic>Mines d\u2019H\u00e9ras-Santander</italic> in 1913 and joined <italic>P\u00e9chiney</italic> in 1918. He was elected President of <italic>Union des Industries M\u00e9tallurgiques et Mini\u00e8res </italic>in 1920, a Regent of BDF in 1921, and Director of insurer <italic>La Nationale-Vie</italic> in 1922. He became President of <italic>Chemins de fer Paris-Lyon-Marseille</italic> in 1925 and joined the boards of <italic>Nationale</italic>, <italic>Moroccan</italic> RR, <italic>\u00c9lectrique du Maroc</italic>.\nAlong with <italic>Comptoir</italic> Marseille and <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>interests, <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> and <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019Afrique Occidentale</italic> (\u201cCFAO\u201d) from 1887. A HC for ventures from 1887, CFAO helped Huguenot <italic>Fraissinet</italic> and <italic>Fabre</italic> shippers organize into <italic>Fabre Fraissinet</italic> in 1889. In 1901, CFAO and other Marseille and Bordeaux merchants and shipowners, reorganized <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic> into <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> (\u201cBFWA\u201d). CFAO directors included <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2019s Emile Mercet, Raoul Gradis\u2019 brother Gaston, <italic>Fabre Fraissinet</italic>\u2019s Paul Cyprien-Fabre and Marc Fraissinet, and Greek <italic>Zarifi</italic> Marseille<italic>.</italic>  \nFrench shipping consolidated around <italic>Chargeurs R\u00e9unis</italic> and <italic>Fabre Fraissinet</italic>, leveraging mutual ties with CFAO to dominate West African trade routes. After WWI, CFAO started <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Commerciale et Industrielle de la C\u00f4te d\u2019Afrique</italic> in 1917, with Marc Fraissinet as Chair. In 1920, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and Octave Homberg founded <italic>French & Colonial </italic>HC as Alexandre Caen Millerand\u2014whose wife was a sister-in-law of Octave Homberg\u2019s cousin\u2014became the first French President of Jewish origin. \nAlthough competition with Germany ended after WWI, France faced increased threat from Belgium. Since SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, <italic>Lambert</italic>, and others funded <italic>Bank of Belgian Congo </italic>and<italic> Banque Commerciale du Congo</italic> around 1908, the Congo\u2019s banking sector grew. British <italic>Standard Bank</italic> of South Africa opened a branch in Elisabethville. Portuguese <italic>National Overseas Bank</italic> opened a branch in Kinshasa, later joined by <italic>Banco de Angola</italic>. compete with SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> created <italic>Banque Belge d\u2019Afrique</italic> in 1923, with offices in L\u00e9opoldville, Elisabethville, Stanleyville, and Matadi. \nSo, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Transatlantique</italic>, SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Nationale</italic>, and <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic> established <italic>Banque Commerciale Africaine</italic>, under the former leadership of <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019Afrique</italic>, formed at the turn of the century. However, the French <italic>franc</italic> collapsed in 1925 led West African trader <italic>Chargeurs R\u00e9unis</italic> to seek financing from Daniel Dreyfus\u2014of the Dupont, Fould, and Lazard clan\u2014in 1926, intwining CFAO to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. \nDavid Weill and Raymond Philippe resigned from Homberg\u2019s <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Grands Travaux de Marseille</italic> in 1925, <italic>Electrique du Littoral M\u00e9diterran\u00e9en</italic>\u2019s Gabriel Cordier joined in their stead. Although <italic>Lazard</italic> acquired 10% of the Argentine <italic>Port of Rosario</italic> PUHC as part of these transactions, she did not receive board seats until 1932. Likewise, the Fraissinet and Fabre families wed in 1927, bringing <italic>Fabre </italic>and <italic>Fraissinet</italic> closer and operating routes and agencies jointly from 1929. \nWhile <italic>Nationale</italic> branched to London and supported trade between French-speaking and English-speaking Africa, <italic>Banque Commerciale Africaine</italic>\u2019s capital increased by 500% and<italic> </italic>BFWA and <italic>Sud-Lumi\u00e8re</italic> formed <italic>Union Electrique Coloniale</italic>. As <italic>French Thomson Houston</italic> co-founded <italic>Co des Eaux et Electricit\u00e9 de Ouest Africain</italic> for Dakkar in 1929, BFWA<italic> </italic>co-founded <italic>Union Electrique Coloniale</italic>, which ran power-stations at Lom\u00e9, Brazzaville, Pointe-Noire and Bangui. By 1931, <italic>Works of Marseille</italic> PUHC moved closer to<italic> French Thomson Houston</italic>.\nAlthough Andr\u00e9 Lazard, son of one of the five founding brothers, and Lucie Goldschmidt divorced in 1912, their daughter Simone married French Catholic aristocrat Paul Fressange in 1918, who soon joined the board of <italic>Comptoir du Maroc </italic>under President Gaston Gunzburg Fould Gradis. While his father Serge had directed <italic>Foundries of Paris and the Seine</italic>, <italic>Paper Mills of Aubeterre & Pont-Vieux</italic>, and <italic>Electric Steelworks of Paris & the Seine</italic> before WWI, Paul\u2019s uncle, Marquis Henri Fressange, was involved with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> and <italic>Porto Rico</italic> RR around the turn of the century. \nBack in 1920, Jacques Ganay\u2014an aristocratic Haber descendant and a nephew of a Schneider\u2014married fellow aristocrat H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Durfort. Three years later, Durfort\u2019s sister married Charles-Albert Boissieu. Charles-Albert served as Inspector of Finances from 1922 to 1927, Inspector General of <italic>Transatlantique</italic><italic> </italic>in 1929, and Deputy Director of <italic>Schneider</italic>\u2019s <italic>Union Europ\u00e9enne Industrielle </italic>from 1930. His third cousin, Jacques Boissieu worked as a banker in Saint-Chamond and became Director of Moroccan and Madagascan banks as well as of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale des Banques de Province</italic><italic>, </italic>which had invested in the rebooted <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> before WWI.\nAfter Jacques Ganay\u2019s brother Eudes married Magdeleine\u2014a great granddaughter of rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> founder Ernest Go\u00fcin and his wife Anna Rodrigues, a Pereire and Fould cousin connected to <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> and <italic>Transatlantique</italic>\u2014her siblings wed Gaston Gunzburg Fould Gradis\u2019 brother and David Weil\u2019s cousin once removed. Magdeleine\u2019s cousin married Alain Solages, who joined the boards of <italic>Batignolles</italic>,<italic> </italic><italic>Schneider</italic>, and <italic>Banque de l\u2019Union des Mines</italic>, launched by collieries in 1923. \nFrom an aristocratic Catholic family, Alain\u2019s father, Marquis J\u00e9r\u00f4me Solages, served as President of the board of Carmaux coal mines and member of the Coal Committee. While Alain\u2019s cousin married Frederique Demachy Seilli\u00e8re in 1920, his brother succeeded J\u00e9r\u00f4me and held positions in <italic>Pyrenean Electric Energy Co</italic> and <italic>Carmaux Glassworks</italic>. By 1928, Andr\u00e9 Lazard\u2019s niece Marie married the son of former President Alexandre Millerand. While another Millerand married a <italic>Batignolles</italic> employee, Marie\u2019s brother wed Esther Hellman Ehrman of California in a Catholic ceremony in 1932. Likewise, Christian mining engineer Jules Aubrun\u2014who had married into the shipping Vigdor family of Boulogne-sur-Mer linked to BDF\u2014left <italic>Schneider</italic>\u2019s <italic>Creusot</italic> in 1929 for <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, representing her in steel enterprises, including <italic>Batignolles</italic>.\nAnother of France\u2019s six major electricity trusts, <italic>l\u2019Electricit\u00e9 Industrielle</italic>, expanded by absorbing regional PUs under the leadership of Pierre Durand of Lyon. Since starting his enterprises in 1906, his daughter married a brother-in-law of a descendant of <italic>Lyonnaise</italic>\u2019s Henri Germain in 1921. Durand secured financing from major foreign investors, including Swiss <italic>Brown Boveri</italic> and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s <italic>Elektrobank</italic>. \nDuring an economic crisis in 1926, <italic>Industrielle</italic> secured Canadian funding from <italic>Nesbitt</italic>, which formed <italic>Foreign Power Securities</italic> PUIHC in 1927 and 1929 with investment from <italic>Iselin</italic> New York, likely with participation of their in-law at <italic>Seligman</italic>. In Canada, SGE gained<italic> Shawinigan</italic> and won a bidding war against <italic>Nesbitt</italic>\u2019s <italic>Canada</italic> <italic>Power </italic>PUIHC for <italic>British Columbia Electric </italic>RR. \nIn late 1928, Italian bankers <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic>, <italic>Pirelli</italic>, and <italic>Bastogi</italic>, started CIBE in Brussels to oversee electrical enterprises. In 1929, <italic>Bank of Brussels </italic>invested in <italic>Electrobel</italic> with funds from <italic>Paribas</italic>; SG <italic>Belge</italic>, and <italic>Solvay</italic>. In June 1929, <italic>Europel</italic> formed in Brussels\u2014with participation from <italic>Electrobel</italic>, BGGE, <italic>Finabel</italic>, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s <italic>Elektrobank</italic>, <italic>Credit Anversois</italic>, <italic>Allard</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris, and SGE\u2014and acquired Buenos Aires\u2019 electric and gas PU. \nWhile SGE bought BGGE\u2019s Brazil assets, BGGE to buy Canadian-domiciled PUIHCs to expand in Egypt, Venezuela, and Poland with investment from <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, all three <italic>Lazard</italic> houses, and other banks as Meyer joined BGGE\u2019s board. Maurice Despret was BGGE\u2019s President. Born into a Christian Belgian ironmaster and glassworks family, Maurice\u2019s father had been a director of SG <italic>Belge</italic> and invested in African enterprises in the 1890s. \nUnable to inherit the presidency of SG <italic>Belge</italic>, Maurice became President of her competitor, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>. He also held directorships in <italic>Bas-Congo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Katanga</italic> RR, <italic>Union Mini\u00e8re</italic>, and tram companies in Spain, Buenos Aires, Naples, and Constantinople. Maurice\u2019s brother Georges directed French and Belgian glassworks and served as a director in <italic>Transatlantique</italic><italic> </italic>Bank, and participated in colonial and industrial ventures.\nMoreover, Jews linked electricity. While Robert Hecker and <italic>Union d\u2019Electricit\u00e9</italic> PUHC\u2019s Ernest Mercier were on <italic>Union Financi\u00e8re\u2019</italic>s board with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 Rene Mayer, they joined David Weill on <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re Electrique</italic>\u2019s board; Hecker and <italic>Electrobel\u2019</italic>s Ernest Weyl were with <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Centrale pour l\u2019Industrie Electrique</italic>; Pierre Weill with <italic>Credit Electrique</italic>; <italic>Union pour l\u2019Industrie et Electricite</italic> was managed by Mercier, Hecker,<italic> </italic>Weyl, and<italic> Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Maroger; and <italic>Union Europ\u00e9enne Industrielle</italic> had Weyl. \nAfter <italic>Harriman</italic> hired Walker\u2019s son-in-law, Prescott Bush, they established a Silesian steel refinery and bid for Poland\u2019s PUs, Hopson\u2019s <italic>Associated</italic> PUIHC expanded from Philippine streetcars to PUs, and another bought Caribbean PUs. Following financial difficulties, Li Ming and the rest of <italic>Shanghai Municipal Council</italic> decided to sell China\u2019s largest PU in an open bidding process. SGE and HSBC won the bid and established the <italic>Shanghai Power </italic>in 1928. Li Ming later joined <italic>Shanghai\u2019s</italic> advisory board to contribute to the expansion of electricity production in the city. GE also invested in GGE. \nBlack entrepreneurs also prospered across state lines. In 1929, the North\u2019s first Black LIC, <italic>Liberty</italic> of Chicago, merged with <italic>Supreme</italic> of Columbus, Ohio, and <italic>Northeastern</italic> LIC of Newark, New Jersey. This merger brought advantages to <italic>Liberty</italic> LIC, including <italic>Supreme</italic>\u2019s industrial insurance and <italic>Northeastern</italic>\u2019s investments and management under Harry Pace. \nHaving bought <italic>People\u2019s Trust </italic>of Brooklyn in 1926, <italic>Citi</italic> began offering consumer loans in 1928, and<italic> </italic>merged with <italic>Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust </italic>in 1929 as the country\u2019s largest bank. The transaction also connected <italic>Citi</italic> with<italic> Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust</italic> Paris executive Benjamin McKee, descendant of President Harrison and <italic>Anheuser Busch</italic> in-law, and James Perkins, a second great nephew of Boston Brahmin Thomas-Handasyd Perkins. Graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> and working at various banks, Perkins became a colonel during WWI and was then elected President of <italic>Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust</italic> until 1929, when he became President of <italic>Citi Farmers Trust </italic>and a <italic>Citi</italic> director. \n<italic>Citi</italic> also maintained a relationship with Robert Winthrop\u2014a descendant of Connecticut Governor Winthrop and of <italic>Civil War</italic> era <italic>Citi</italic> CEO Moses Taylor\u2014and clerked there after <italic>Harvard</italic> Business in 1929 before joining <italic>Winthrop</italic>, which his grandfather founded after his partner Anthony Drexel left to partner with <italic>Morgan</italic>. Winthrop was also a cousin-in-law of the Bakers, who controlled <italic>Morgan</italic>-allied <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>.\nThe same year, NYSE financed a brokers\u2019 bank. Buying <italic>Seaboard</italic> NB, Rockefeller-led <italic>Equitable Trust</italic> of New York hired George Champion. A descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and extended cousin of the Cooke, Barney, and Jerome families, Champion graduated <italic>Dartmouth</italic> in 1926 and joined NB <italic>of Commerce</italic> in New York. He married the daughter of a Chicago banker who headed <italic>Illinois</italic> LIC, founded by his father. \nRailroads and communications were outside AA1914. IA1920 encouraged ICC to redistribute income per <italic>Munn</italic>, but railroad equity fell as a court upheld this in 1927 until the Court overturned in May 1929. Since America fused <italic>Adams</italic> <italic>Express</italic>, <italic>American Express</italic>, and <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> into <italic>American Railway Express</italic>, splitting ownership equally, in 1918, <italic>Chase</italic> and<italic> Hayden Stone</italic> gained board seats. \nIn March 1929, the three express companies sold their<italic> American Railway</italic> shares to the <italic>Railway Express</italic>, a monopoly owned by 86 railroads. After <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>, <italic>Adams Express</italic>, and <italic>Hallgarten</italic> organized <italic>Haygart</italic> IHC, <italic>Adams Express</italic> acquired most of <italic>Railway Express </italic>by May.<italic> </italic>In 1927 <italic>PENN</italic> formed the <italic>PENN</italic> RIHC and <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> acquired shares of <italic>Chesapeake & Ohio</italic> RR. After <italic>Morgan</italic> organized <italic>Alleghany</italic> RIHC with <italic>Sweringen</italic> of Cleveland, <italic>Kuhn</italic> funded <italic>PENN</italic> RIHC.\nAfter forming in Cuba with <italic>Citi</italic> promotion in 1920, <italic>International Telephone & Telegraph </italic>(\u201cIT&T\u201d) hired <italic>Smith</italic> by 1923. Edward Smith had founded <italic>Smith</italic> in Philadelphia in the 1890s. As IT&T became too politically complicated, <italic>Morgan </italic>took over the relationship, and financed IT&T\u2019s purchase of AT&T\u2019s <italic>International </italic><italic>Western Electric</italic>. While AT&T and IT&T acquired telephony since 1920, they forged an alliance in 1925 to split domestic and foreign communication markets, with both becoming leaders in their markets by 1926. \nBut as GE\u2019s RCA innovated wireless radio under the leadership of Jewish David Sarnoff, AT&T invested in stations, <italic>Western Union</italic> strengthened its service to Mexico and bought<italic> Mexican Telegraph </italic>from <italic>All America Cables</italic>, and RCA sought to buy IT&T. The same week that Congress passed the <italic>Radio Act of 1927</italic> to bar AT&T from broadcast and an RCA-IT&T merger, <italic>Roosevelt</italic> merged their South and Central American <italic>All America Cables</italic> into IT&T and joined her board. As IT&T bought global telephony with <italic>Morgan</italic>-funding, <italic>Smith</italic> continued participating. By 1929, <italic>Smith</italic> floated <italic>Roosevelt Field</italic>, along with <italic>Barney</italic> of Philadelphia. (Jay Cooke\u2019s son-in-law founded securities firm <italic>Barney</italic> in the 1890s.) IT&T competitors included <italic>Siemens</italic>, which linked with BGE with <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s aid.\nIn 1928, GE, through IGE, merged <italic>Vickers</italic>\u2014including the former<italic> </italic><italic>Westinghouse</italic> Britain after WWI by <italic>Midland Bank</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> London at the same time as <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s <italic>English Electric</italic> takeover <italic>Siemens</italic> Britain\u2014and <italic>British Thomson-Houston</italic> into <italic>Associated Electrical Industries</italic> (\u201cAEI\u201d). Under the AEI HC, the electric<italic> </italic><italic>British Thomson-Houston</italic> and armament <italic>Vickers</italic> remained non-integrated. In the same year, <italic>Midland</italic>\u2019s Reginald McKenna joined BGGE\u2019s board and joined merger efforts. L\nikewise, GE contracted with <italic>Siemens</italic>, GGE, and <italic>Koppel</italic> to invest in electric lamp producer <italic>Osram</italic>. When AEI did not renew <italic>Westinghouse</italic>\u2019s British agreements, <italic>Westinghouse</italic> financed <italic>Lazard</italic> London to take over Britain\u2019s third big engineer, <italic>English Electric </italic>with <italic>Chase </italic>NB. <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Chase</italic> helped a Chicago-domiciled PUIHC to gain control London\u2019s PU, Britain\u2019s largest, between 1925 and 1929, when they hired a Smyth cousin to run the PU. \nWhile AA1914 maintained that IHCs could only control regulated industries, this sector grew as <italic>Attleboro</italic> spurred federal regulation along the lines of WWI associations. Without an IHC, Rockefeller-in-law Marcellus Hartley Dodge\u2019s <italic>Remington </italic>expanded her typewriter business. After introducing her first cash register in 1918 and America\u2019s first electric typewriter in 1925, <italic>Remington</italic> <italic>Typewriter</italic> merged with <italic>Marine Midland</italic> BHC-affiliated <italic>Rand </italic> and other competitors to form <italic>Remington Rand</italic> in 1927.\nDominating the chemicals industry and controlling <italic>General Motor</italic>, <italic>DuPont</italic> extended into <italic>STEEL</italic> in 1927. As FTC investigated her, <italic>DuPont</italic> sold off <italic>STEEL</italic> and sponsored a chemicals IHC. The Copelands ran <italic>DuPont</italic>, Since Charles Copeland became the assistant to the President of <italic>Laflin Rand Powder Co</italic> in 1899, he married Luisa DuPont after <italic>DuPont</italic> acquired <italic>Laflin Rand</italic> and made him Assistant Treasurer of <italic>DuPont </italic>in 1904.\nAs<italic> </italic>Congress regulated airmail carriers from 1926, courts deemed airports public interests that cities could construct and operate. So, regional operators propagated until mergers consolidated the fragmented industry into integrated networks. <italic>General Motor</italic> created an airline division using a decentralized structure rather than a HC model. \nThree HCs dominated the industry: <italic>United Aircraft</italic>, <italic>Aviation Corp</italic>, and <italic>North American Aviation</italic>. <italic>United Aircraft </italic>formed in 1929 after Frederick Rentschler merged his aircraft manufacturer<italic> Pratt Whitney </italic>with <italic>Boeing</italic>, <italic>Chance Vought</italic>, and other firms. After working at this father\u2019s <italic>Hooven</italic> <italic>Owen</italic> <italic>Rentschler</italic> foundry, Rentschler wed an extended Rockefeller cousin in 1921 and acquired <italic>Pratt Whitney </italic>in 1925, the same year his brother Gordon became VP of <italic>Citi </italic>and heir apparent to President Charles Mitchell.\nMeanwhile, Juan Trippe, after graduating from <italic>Yale</italic> in 1920, co-founded <italic>Colonial Air Transport</italic> in 1925 and won the first airmail contract between New York and Boston. In 1928, Trippe married the daughter of deceased <italic>Morgan </italic>partner Edward Stettinius and acquired <italic>Aviation Corp</italic>. With backing from <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Harriman</italic>, <italic>Aviation Corp</italic> went public in March 1929 and soon controlled 80 subsidiaries and 11 airmail contracts, including <italic>Pan American Airways</italic>.\nIn March 1929, <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> and <italic>Hallgarten</italic> started <italic>Aviation Securities</italic> IHC to finance aviation ventures. By December, <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> and <italic>Blair</italic> backed Canadian-born banker Clement Keys\u2019 <italic>North American Aviation</italic>. Keys helped establish <italic>Transcontinental Air Transport</italic>, which launched the first 48-hour transcontinental rail and air service in July 1929, under the leadership of Charles Lindbergh, who married the daughter of former <italic>Morgan </italic>Partner Dwight Morrow. In August 1929, Keys merged <italic>Willys-Overland</italic>\u2019s <italic>Curtiss Aeroplane & Motor</italic> with <italic>Wright Aeronautical</italic> to form <italic>Curtiss-Wright Corp</italic>, America\u2019s second-largest aircraft manufacturer.\nAround the same time, the American vaudeville and film industry became a vertically integrated business, with major Hollywood companies owning theater chains, allowing them control over production, distribution, and exhibition. This integration changed management styles and led to significant banker involvement. America\u2019s motion picture industry began on the East Coast as the exclusive dominion Christians, including <italic>Dickson</italic>, <italic>Casler</italic>, <italic>Marvin</italic>, <italic>Koopman</italic>, <italic>Long</italic>, <italic>Smith</italic>, <italic>Scull</italic>, <italic>Kleine</italic>, <italic>Marion</italic>, <italic>Berst</italic>, and <italic>M\u00e9li\u00e9s</italic>, who headed <italic>American Mutoscope Co</italic>, <italic>Kalem</italic>, <italic>Vitagraph</italic>, and the most powerful, <italic>Edison</italic>. \nFacing competition from Jewish-made low capital, nickelodeons, Thomas Edison proposed the eight largest firms form <italic>Motion Picture Patents Co</italic> in 1908 to protect his financial interests and preserve what he saw as the industry\u2019s moral integrity. Soon under the leadership of Irish-Catholic Joseph Kennedy, the trust formed in 1910 and pooled motion picture patents and imposed licensing fees on manufacturers, distributors, and exhibitors. \nIn response to this monopoly, Carl Laemmle\u2014connected to Swiss<italic> Baer</italic>\u2019s Gerstle family\u2014led Jewish independent filmmakers to import foreign film and equipment. While most bankers shunned Jews, some, like Catholic banker Giannini of California, funded Sam Goldwyn by 1912. The struggle culminated in a legal battle in 1915, resulting in the dissolution of <italic>Motion Picture Patents Co</italic>. Along with Laemmle of <italic>Universal</italic>, Jewish pioneers thrived, including Adolf Zukor (<italic>Famous Players</italic>), Harry Cohn (<italic>Columbia</italic>), and the eponymous William Fox and the Warner brothers. While Jesse Lasky formed <italic>Lasky</italic> with his brothers-in-law Samuel Goldwyn, their kinterlink broke in 1915. \nAs Zukor and Lasky merged into <italic>Famous Players-Lasky </italic>in 1916, raising financing from <italic>Hallgarten</italic> by 1919. Having sold his shares, Goldwyn formed <italic>Goldwyn</italic>. However, financial distress forced him to sell <italic>Goldwyn</italic> to <italic>Metro Pictures</italic>, which soon partnered with Louis Mayer\u2019s to form MGM. Since competitors paid out higher contracts to movie stars, Zukor shifted competition to distribution. With capital from <italic>Kuhn</italic>, Zukor formed <italic>Paramount Pictures</italic> to buy up theaters. By 1920, the children of Loew and Zukor married. \nIn 1921, the FTC accused them of trade restraint via <italic>Paramount</italic> ownership, exploiting the film business\u2019 phases. Becoming an independent producer, Goldwyn joined independent producers cooperative <italic>United Artists</italic> in 1926 with advice from <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s Eberstadt. In 1927, court ruled against block booking and theater growth, with the industry shifting attention to sound in film. (Block booking entailed independent theaters showing movies only after the integrated chain theaters.) \nAt <italic>Goldman</italic>, Catchings aided <italic>Warner</italic>, who was grappling with financial issues. Catchings\u2019 secured bank credit for <italic>Warner</italic> into synchronized sound with <italic>Morgan</italic>-AT&T\u2019s <italic>Western Electric</italic> in late 1925. From 1927, <italic>Western Electric</italic> exclusively licensed sound film production to gain 90% of sound film market. Likewise, <italic>Speyer</italic> and <italic>Seligman</italic> bought phonograph <italic>Victor Talking Machine Co </italic>in 1926, and then absorbed independent distributors in America and international subsidiaries with financing from <italic>Hallgarten</italic>. \nClosely collaborating with AT&T for technical aid, RCA\u2019s <italic>National Broadcasting Co</italic> (\u201cNBC\u201d) and <italic>Paramount</italic>\u2019s <italic>Columbia Broadcasting System</italic> (\u201cCBS\u201d) emerged as radio leaders. This merged the motion picture and electrical industries, notably with the telephone trust\u2019s sound picture control, benefiting producers like <italic>Warner</italic> and <italic>Fox</italic>. UST supported investment in theaters with TA1928\u2019s exemptions.  \nFrance had dominated early motion pictures. Among the earliest, L\u00e9on Gaumont left school at 16 and apprenticed as a binocular maker. At 28, he became director of a company that he bought in 1895 and renamed <italic>Gaumont</italic>. Two years later, <italic>Path\u00e9</italic> became a joint-stock company, backed by <italic>Lyonnais</italic> and <italic>Franco-Swiss</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Franco-Swiss</italic> reorganized<italic> Gaumont</italic> into a joint-stock corporation in 1906. By 1914, <italic>Gaumont</italic> was vertically integrated in film production. <italic>Eclipse</italic>, became the fourth-largest French film producer by 1910 with financing from <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Industrielle des T\u00e9l\u00e9phones</italic>\u2019 Ernest May in 1906, a year after his daughter married Christian Lazard.\nHowever, after WWI, French <italic>Path\u00e9</italic> and <italic>Gaumont</italic> lost their American and British subsidiaries and faced growing international competition from American <italic>Paramount</italic>, <italic>Fox</italic>, and <italic>Universal</italic>, including in Germany, where they formed alliances with <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> funded UFA. While <italic>Gaumont</italic> came under the control of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Commercial</italic> by 1922, Jean Sap\u00e9ne took control of <italic>Cin\u00e9romans</italic> and allied with <italic>Path\u00e9</italic> to produce serials. By the end of 1923, with the support of <italic>Marchal</italic>, Sap\u00e9ne gained control of <italic>Path\u00e9</italic>, reorganizing her into a vertically integrated corporation, while <italic>Eclipse</italic> withered. That year, <italic>Path\u00e9</italic> allied with Hugo Stinnes\u2019 newly funded German <italic>Westi</italic>. However, Stinnes died and <italic>Westi</italic> dissolved in 1924. Likewise, Russian emigres produced French films through independent producers such as <italic>Alabtros</italic>, with funding from the Epsteens of <italic>Schneider</italic>\u2019s <italic>Bank of Northern Countries </italic>and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris.\nWithout showmen American theater owners, bankers created RKO. Since buying a New England theater chain in 1919, the retirement of his <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> mentor led Joseph Kennedy to start <italic>Kennedy</italic> in 1923. Through <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>, Kennedy negotiated with <italic>Grahams Trading </italic>of London, which owned a majority stake in <italic>Robertson Cole Picture </italic>in 1925. Failing to find a buyer, he bought FBO with a consortium in 1926. American <italic>Path\u00e9</italic> and two other companies then invited Kennedy to oversee their turnarounds. \nAs <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul became RCA\u2019s banker that year, Kennedy met RCA head David Sarnoff. Forming a partnership with RCA partnership Kennedy bought <italic>Keith-Albee-Orpheum</italic> (\u201cKAO\u201d) and American <italic>Path\u00e9</italic> with <italic>Blair</italic>\u2019s Elisha Walk and other bankers in May 1928. In October, he merged FBO and KAO to create <italic>Radio-Keith-Orpheum</italic> (\u201cRKO\u201d). After <italic>Fox</italic> acquired <italic>Pilo</italic> theatres in 1928, Altschul\u2019s in-law <italic>Lehman</italic> executed RCA\u2019s acquisition of RKO theaters with funding from <italic>Atlas</italic> and <italic>Rockefeller</italic> in 1929. \nAs <italic>Fox </italic>bought British <italic>Gaumont</italic>, RCA acquired <italic>Victor Talking Machine</italic>. RCA and <italic>Western Electric</italic> also expanded internationally. After <italic>Commerz</italic> and Dutch <italic>Oyens</italic> funded <italic>Tobis</italic>, which acquired a sound-on-film system patent and began equipping cinemas in 1928, <italic>Siemens </italic>and GGE formed <italic>Klangfilm</italic>, which competed with <italic>Tobis</italic> until their merger in March 1929. Dominating the American market, RCA and <italic>Western Electric</italic> expanded into Europe but faced litigation from <italic>Tobis Klangfilm</italic>, which contracted with <italic>Fox</italic>. In 1929, <italic>Gaumont</italic> formed a trust with <italic>Path\u00e9</italic> and other French competitors as film production declined. \nGaining control of <italic>Stanley</italic> theaters of Philadelphia, <italic>Warner</italic> divided Eastern movie studio dominance with <italic>Fox</italic>. While <italic>Paramount </italic>and <italic>Warner</italic> worked with Jewish <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>Fox</italic> affiliated with British studios and, like Insull, hired <italic>Stuart</italic> to merge with MGM in 1929, setting a film studio record. \nSimon Strau\u00df\u2014a descendant of Frankfurt bankers through Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother\u2014founded <italic>Franklin Trust &</italic> <italic>Savings Bank </italic>in Chicago in 1911 and moved to New York City in 1915. After Strau\u00df\u2019s nephew married <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>VP Max May Max May\u2019s daughter that year, Strau\u00df\u2019s daughter married a cousin of <italic>Kuhn</italic> co-founder Solomon Loeb\u2019s grandson-in-law in 1917. Over this time, Strau\u00df innovated real estate mortgage securities. He incorporated <italic>Strau\u00df</italic> BIHC in Delaware in 1926, formed <italic>Strau\u00df </italic>NB of Chicago in 1928, and founded Carl Laemmle\u2019s <italic>Universal</italic>.\nAs share prices soared, so did movie focused IHCs. After incorporating in 1923 to finance motion pictures, <italic>Motion Picture Capital Corp</italic> transitioned to an IHC by 1928, and merged into <italic>Barney</italic>\u2019s BIHC in 1929. (Jay Cooke\u2019s son-in-law had founded <italic>Barney</italic> in the 1890s.)\nGiven that Jewish executives guided the move business from Hollywood, co-religionists had a dominant role in film production, accounting for 53 of 85 prominent names by the 1930s. Amidst this transformation, there was a dual push for regulation of the film industry, with some advocating for content control through state legislatures and a proposal for federal level, while concerns over studio monopolies and antitrust actions by President Hoover and DOJ prompted Hollywood executives to make concessions on film content. \nAll HCs pledged subsidiary shares as loan collateral. With corporate finance using capital markets over CP, HCs used the equity stakes they purchased as collateral to secure bank loans. Similarly, securities firms required MMSEC to carry securities and make markets. Instead of capital gains taxes, MMSEC monetized securities with interest deductions. Since FRS did not discount private bonds and stocks or loans secured by them, her money market influence shrank. While FRS <italic>New York</italic> Governor Strong fostered currency stabilization through the 1920s, he died in 1928. Instead, FRS increased pressure on banks to limit broker loans from 1928, leading to suits and bills against FRS. \nWhile usury limited CP to 6%, exempt MMSEC rates surpassed it, and drew nonbanks and IHCs into MMSEC. FRS ordered NYSE to hike margins and NYCH to cease small nonbank collateral loans and replace account interest with trade commissions. Banks followed FRS in reducing CP and acceptances, leaving only MMSEC. By 1928, the French Ministry redefined FX policy, and required BDF to buy more gold. While France joined NYSE as a gold sinkhole to exacerbate debt deflation in Germany and Britain, the French also invested in MMSEC. As BOE and GRB increased rates to retain gold in early 1929<italic>,</italic> foreigners ran from NYSE. FRS <italic>New York</italic> discounted more CP despite other FRS District Banks\u2019 protests. \nMeanwhile, the Court warned against non-railroad receiverships\u2014that she had allowed after the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>\u2014pushing PUs and industrials toward liquidation in early 1928. By early 1929, a scandal embroiled New York bankruptcy judges. DOJ concluded in early 1930 that junior creditors needed protection from collusion. Tight monetary policy and demand for MMSEC increased MMSEC rates and drew more funds. As NYSE common stock dividend yields fell below the safest bonds, creditors demanded higher yields for distressed, HC, and foreign debt. \nBy May, FRS abandoned her MMSEC warnings as she could not discern commercial collateral loans from speculative ones. Chicago and Philadelphia exempted collateral loans from usury like New York to maintain credit access. Although collateral rates fell and underlying security valuation remained stable, most IHCs did not publish their holdings as investments were trade secrets. With hidden information and unsecured leverage, IHCs had option-like payoffs. IHC shares did not typically qualify for loan collateral and, like HC non-voting preferred shares, traded based on asset value as they did not pay cash dividends. The volatile demand collateral rates particularly inflated these assets.\nThe grandson of two prominent BOE directors, Montague Collet Norman worked at <italic>Brown Shipley</italic> before becoming BOE Governor in 1920. Unlike the unpopular and incompetent bankers of Cunliffe\u2019s ilk, Norman restored BOE\u2019s vigor. As his power grew, he rejected <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>\u2019s efforts to rationalize British coal in 1928. He similarly rejected efforts from banking newcomers. \nDuring WWI, Clarence Hatry flipped a bank he bought from the Germans to <italic>Bevan</italic> interests. After several more ventures, he formed an IHC to consolidate steel companies amidst low coal prices. However, Norman mistrusted him to create a company controlling 60% of British steel and persuaded banks to withdraw support. With only German <italic>Kleinwort</italic> remaining and, Hatry registered the company in August. But squeezed by rates, he forged bearer securities for credit.\nAt the same time, Parliament reformed publicly traded corporations to increase disclosure requirements, ease mergers, and require judicial confirmation for debt reorg minority dissents. Following the British reform, NYSE required IHCs to disclose portfolio holdings by late October. Likewise, American credit fell as FRS shifted discounting from New York CP to acceptances to curb speculation and limit gold inflows. While FRS pressured banks to cease transforming MMSEC into tax-free deposit accounts, France strengthened her market by reducing foreign securities taxes. \nAs Atlantic liquidity fell and disclosure requirements grew, Hatry confessed his fraud, creditors liquidated his IHC, and BOE raised rates to stem outflows. After the courts imprisoned Hatry, his venture became Britain\u2019s most stable steel firm in the \u201830s. (He later became a successful publisher after his release from prison.) Since September 1929, Vienna\u2019s <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic> faced collapse due to an imbalance between assets and loans after expanding through the 1920s. As <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>struggled with liquidity and raising capital, <italic>Austrian National Bank</italic> intervened to facilitate a merger with <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> in October<italic>.</italic>\nWhile BOE rates grew, American states called for increased PUHC regulation. After New York Governor Al Smith and Moses reorganized the state legislature to centralize power in the governorship in 1928, Smith resigned to run for the presidency on a public electricity platform. While he lost, his handpicked successor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (\u201cFDR\u201d), replaced him in New York. As FTC began investigating PUHCs in 1928, FDR followed in early 1929. FDR retained Smith\u2019s Francis Perkins, a Boston Brahmin-cousin, re-appointing her as head of <italic>State Industrial Commission</italic>. FDR also gained the support of Perkins\u2019 friend and supporter of Soviet and German socialism, Averell Harriman. \nSmith\u2019s other lieutenants opposed FDR for his perceived disloyalty. While Robert Moses retreated to his protected post in New York City\u2019s <italic>Parks Council</italic> and continued to build his own agencies, Joseph Proskauer resigned from the state\u2019s Court in 1930 to resume private practice. Despite being a third cousin of John Morgan, FDR demanded Smith-style regulation over hydroelectricity against <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>United </italic>PUIHC, and, with advice from Leland Olds and <italic>Bonbright</italic> cousin James Bonbright, a <italic>Columbia</italic> finance professor,, changed PUHC rate setting from fair market returns approved by the Court in <italic>Smyth v Ames</italic> (1897) along <italic>Munn</italic> lines to inflation-unadjusted historic investments. By October, PU commissioners in Massachusetts refused <italic>United </italic>PUIHC\u2019s Boston PU from splitting shares.\nWith increased risk, creditors ran from MMSEC to the short-term FRS-discounted debt. NYSE, manufacturing, and global credit collapsed. As nonbank creditors converted MMSEC into bank deposits, banks regained control of MMSEC. FRS added liquidity by purchasing UST debt and trade acceptances\u2014not domestic CP\u2014and NYSE eased margins. Only two small stock brokerages failed. The only PUHC to fail had an international focus with impaired liquidity.\nWhile <italic>Citi</italic> NB and <italic>Corn Exchange Bank Trust </italic>(\u201cCEBT\u201d)\u2014<italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s SB from 1873\u2014planned to merge, the deal collapsed with the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic>. Within weeks, <italic>Chase</italic> bought around 20% of CEBT and rumors spread that <italic>Chase</italic> would buy CEBT. MMSEC rates fell below CP by year\u2019s end as capital markets resumed, Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Equitable Trust</italic> bought <italic>Chase </italic>to create the largest bank in the world. Although President Hoover targeted movie studios with antitrust, he cut taxes and secured pledges from Insull and others for business as usual. \nBy acquiring <italic>Chase</italic>, the Rockefellers aligned with John McHugh and his son-in-law Gerald Beal at <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York, where Avery Stillman Rockefeller ascended the ranks. Avery\u2019s cousin James Stillman Rockefeller joined <italic>Citi</italic>\u2014which his grandfather had presided over and father Percy was a director of\u2014in 1930 after being told he had no future as a banker. Likewise, their cousin John Stillman Rockefeller associated with <italic>Chatham Phenix </italic>NB, which financed the <italic>Empire State Building</italic> from 1929. <italic>Lehman</italic> in-law Hellman sold his California banks to <italic>TransAmerica</italic>. Like mechanized mass production forced Jewish artisans from small shops into sweat shops, banking corporations squeezed out their Jewish bankers.\nThe DuPonts also extended in finance. Having wed Pierre\u2019s sister, Robert Carpenter joined the boards of <italic>Equitable Trust</italic> and <italic>Girard Trust</italic>, and his brother Walter became a <italic>Chase</italic> NB director. Pierre DuPont\u2019s cousin Alfred moved to Jacksonville after the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic> and, along with his brother-in-law Edward Ball, built <italic>Florida</italic> NB of Jacksonville into Florida\u2019s largest banking group. After DuPont invested funds to stop a bank run in 1929, <italic>Florida</italic> NB included 23 banks by the 1950s. Ball continued to lead operations after DuPont\u2019s death in 1935, expanding holdings to include railroads, paper companies, and land across the state. Pierre\u2019s second cousin once removed and brother\u2019s great nephew, Francis DuPont, shifted from chemistry to finance, founding broker<italic> DuPont</italic> in 1931.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>American Jews & Other Minority Professionals</italic>\nDespite significant contributions and antisemitic tropes that \u2018Jews run everything\u2019, Jewish influence was limited and under constant threat from Christian competition and political interference. \nExamples of anti-Sematic discrimination against prominent Jews initially focused on social exclusion for political reasons. Social clubs emerged in the late 19th century as exclusive private organizations pivotal in establishing social connections among the elite in major cities like New York. From 1899 to 1904, for example, John Morgan allocated around 10% of his time to clubs, akin to his museum involvement. Combined, clubs and museums matched his time spent on railroads. \nDuring the Civil War, a controversy led to the formation of <italic>Union League Club</italic>. When a club allowed Democratic senator from Louisiana Judah Benjamin to resign rather than expel him, other members formed <italic>Union League Club</italic> and stipulated that membership required absolute and unqualified loyalty to the American Government. With close ties to the Republican Party, Joseph Seligman and his brothers were among the earliest members. However, after New York\u2019s reformist civil body exposed the corrupt rule of the <italic>Tweed Gang</italic> in New York City, Tweed member Judge Henry Hilton sought revenge. \nAs manager of <italic>Grand Union Hotel</italic> of <italic>Stewart</italic>\u2019s mercantile conglomerate in Saratoga Springs, New York, Hilton denied entry citing Judaism to the <italic>Committee of Seventy</italic>\u2019s prominent member and Joseph Seligman and his family in 1877. By 1893, younger members of <italic>Union League Club</italic> rejected Joseph\u2019s nephew Theodore Seligman for this race. Nor did any <italic>Kuhn</italic> wives belong to the elite female <italic>Colony Club</italic>, which many <italic>Morgan </italic>wives joined. Th exclusivity did not stop at religion. After the <italic>Union Club</italic> blackballed several of his friends were from, John Morgan co-founded the <italic>Metropolitan Club</italic> in 1891 and was elected president. Although mostly conflicting limited to English and Dutch Episcopalians, Adolf Ladenburg and several Catholics had memberships.\nAntisemitism accelerated with Jewish flight from Europe, first from Russian pogroms at the turn of the century, and then with WWI. After decades of nativist attempts, Congress limited immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe by passing of the <italic>Literacy Act of 1917</italic> despite a veto from President Wilson. And as rising literacy rates in Southern and Eastern Europe nullified the nativist <italic>Literacy Act of 1917</italic>, Congress passed the <italic>Emergency Immigration Act </italic>to numerically restrict entry in 1921 followed by the restrictive <italic>Immigration Act of 1924</italic>. Since rural Jews moved to Vienna, Budapest, Warsaw, Lodz, Odessa, Kiew, and other European metropoles, the largest destination was New York City, which was between a quarter and a third Jewish after WWI. Despite the presence and education of Jews in that city, 90% of white-collar jobs in New York City went to non-Jews through the 1920s.\nBy the 1930s, Jewish representation across several key industries in America was limited. In sectors like automotive, coal, steel, rubber, petroleum, and chemicals, Jewish presence is sparse, primarily limited to specific functions like marketing or research. This trend extends to railroads, coal, shipping, aviation, telecommunications, engineering, heavy machinery, lumber, and dairy products, Jewish involvement was negligible. One of two leaders in the chemicals sector of the 1930s, was San Francisco-born <italic>Wallac</italic><italic>k</italic><italic> Cook</italic> lawyer Alfred Cook. Cook served as Counsel for Adolph Ochs and advised his purchase of <italic>New York Times</italic> in 1896. After marrying Eugene Meyer\u2019s sister in 1902, he directed Meyer\u2019s <italic>Allied Chemical</italic> in the 1930s.\nThere were several Jewish-owned firms in scrap metal, the largest of which was <italic>Luria</italic>. Started by refugees from Russian Lithuania, <italic>Luria</italic> helped regulate the use and allocation of scrap iron during WWI. Jewish participation was stronger in the distribution end of light industries, like textiles. While producing involved in 5 to 16% of wool, silk, cotton, and rayon by the 1930s, Jews accounted for nearly half of wool sales agents, 75% of silk and converters, 85% control of men\u2019s clothing, 95% of women\u2019s dresses and furs. However, they had only a minority presence in sectors such as boots and shoes manufacturing. \nWhile their influence is notable in tobacco and alcohol, Christians were dominant. Along with veiled discrimination, Jews were the target of flagrant hatred from family-focused icons ranging from Walt Disney to Henry Ford, who gained the admiration of Adolph Hitler. While <italic>Humble Oil</italic> of Houston did not engage Jews as rule, drug firm, <italic>Eli Lilly</italic> of Indianapolis employed 2 Jews out of nearly 4,000 people, and <italic>Western Union</italic> refused to hire Jewish messenger boys. \nOnly talent-driven sectors offered advancement for Jews. But like mechanized mass production forced Jewish artisans from small shops into sweat shops, banking corporations squeezed out their Jewish bankers, forcing them to sell out or consolidate. With a long history in finance and education, Jews had a more nuanced role in professional fields, despite a virtual lack of market power. Of the thousands of NBs, only a handful of Jewish banks received charters, and only after WWI. One was <italic>Bank of the United States</italic> (\u201cBOUS\u201d) NB in New York. \nAnother was <italic>Foreman</italic> NB of Chicago. Since Henry Greenebaum, from the family of a representative of Napoleon\u2019s Grand Sanhedrin related to the Rothschilds, built one of Chicago\u2019s first Jewish banks, his sister wed fellow Bavarian Gerhard Foreman, who started a bank and saw his cousin later marry Abraham Kuhn\u2019s cousins. As Greenebaum\u2019s Straus cousins thrived with <italic>Macy</italic>, they kinterlinked with Lehman and Kuhn. In 1923, the bank reorganized as <italic>Foreman</italic> NB and <italic>Foreman Trust & Savings Bank</italic> and merged into one of Chicago\u2019s three largest banks by 1929.\nLike Blacks, Jewish financiers could only form SBs in certain states. While Ellik Nirenstein and Barney Rapaport established what became <italic>Merchants Savings Bank </italic>and the only Jewish bank in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1920, the non-Jewish <italic>Riverside Trust</italic> soon absorbed the bank. Although several prominent Jewish brokers existed, most descended from Katz or Court Jews, and even they were not welcome at <italic>Morgan </italic>and other Christians firms. <italic>Morgan </italic>did not have a Jewish senior executive until the 1980s. \nAmong the few Jews <italic>Morgan</italic> did hire was Mortimer Grunebaum Fleishhacker. A grandson of <italic>Lazard</italic>-affiliated <italic>London, Paris</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> & American Bank </italic>of San Franisco\u2019s Sigmund Grunebaum, Fleishhacker earned a degree in economics at <italic>Uni </italic><italic>of California</italic>, and apprenticed with <italic>Morgan</italic> from late 1927 for a year, working in multiple departments, including loans, where he evaluated stockbroker collateral after NYSE closing and issued notices for insufficient margins.\nLike in banking, minority middlemen long shaped accounting. Accountancies formed soon after Parliament extended free incorporation<italic> </italic>following the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>. Facing barriers due to his Catholic background, William Deloitte, a grandson of a French emigrant from 1793, unquestionably impacted the field. So did other non-conformists. Quaker-influenced William Cooper founded <italic>Cooper</italic>. Samuel Price, founder of <italic>Price Waterhouse</italic>, had a brother married to a Baptist minister\u2019s daughter. Edwin Waterhouse, his partner, was a Quaker who later joined the Church of England. By 1897, <italic>Barclay</italic> cousin William Barclay Peat became an accountant and would later form the \u2018P\u2019 in KPMG.\nWhen America introduced federal income tax in 1913, Jews serviced businesses and individuals. Among the most successful was <italic>Seidman</italic>. Louis Seidman of Russia emigrated to America in 1899 with his family, settling in New York and working in the fur industry. In 1910, his son Max founded <italic>Seidman</italic>, with the garment industry as his initial client base. Max worked multiple jobs while attending <italic>New York Uni</italic> at night, earning his CPA in 1914. After working at the Federal Aircraft Production Board during WWI, Max\u2019s brother Frank joined the firm in 1919, and branched to Grand Rapids for the furniture industry. By the 1920s, <italic>Seidman</italic> expanded to Chicago, Rockford, Gardner, Jamestown, and Newark. \nAmong America\u2019s first female accountants was Lena Mendelsohn. Of unknown relation to the Katz family, Mendelssohn was born in Sweden to Jewish parents, who immigrated to America. While her father worked as a bookkeeper and later as a businessman, Lena began her accounting practice in Boston in 1913 and conducted her practice until her death in 1928.\nThe same situation existed in FRS. Serving less than four years combined between 1916 and 1920, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Paul Warburg and <italic>Seligma</italic>n\u2019s Albert Strauss were the only Jewish Vice Governors of FRS until the 1990s. In 1930, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Eugene Meyer became the first Jewish Governor of FRS. After Meyer resigned in 1933, President FDR appointed Henry Morgenthau Jr as the first Jewish UST Secretary and FRS Chair. The secular son of Harlem developer Henry Guggenheim Morgenthau Sr, Henry Jr had married Elinor Fatman, a cousin of <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York Altschul\u2019s cousin-in-law. Morgenthau remained FRS until FA1935 merged the position under the FRS Governor role. FRS had no other Jewish Chairs until Arthur Burns in the 1970s. Likewise, after FA1933 replaced stockholder double-liability with <italic>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</italic> (\u201cFDIC\u201d), <italic>Seidman</italic>\u2019s William Seidman became FDIC\u2019s first Jewish Chair in 1985.\nOn the other hand, even elite Jewish banks hired Christians. During WWI, <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic> hired Tennessee-born Christian Waddill Catchings formerly affiliated with <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Export </italic>department as Harry Goldman retired for supporting Germany. By 1925, Catchings hired Albert Gordon, a <italic>Harvard</italic> Business educated Catholic whose father became wealthy supplying the British Army leather in WWI. After Lehman left <italic>Goldman Lehman</italic>, Catchings became President of <italic>Goldman</italic> and owned most of her equity, he launched <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>IHC in 1928. \nIn 1924, <italic>Lehman</italic> promoted her first non-Jew and non-family member, John Hancock, a Naval officer who Herbert Lehman worked with at <italic>War Industries Board</italic> under Bernard Baruch. Likewise, <italic>Lehman</italic> hired Manhattan-born Curtis Dall, who had served overseas in 1918 and graduated from <italic>Princeton</italic>. Dall became manager of her syndicate department in 1924 and, two years later, married FDR\u2019s daughter. However, he left <italic>Lehman</italic> for a Christian firm in 1929 and divorced in 1934. Shortly after Dall left, <italic>Lehman</italic> hired Joseph Thomas\u2014whose father headed <italic>Continental</italic> NB and <italic>United Trust & Investment Co</italic> of Fort Worth, Texas\u2014and made him partner in 1937.\nSince 1926, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Paul Warburg hired Massachusetts-born Christian lawyer Hugh Knowlton as VP of <italic>International Acceptance </italic>and soon VP of <italic>International Manhattan</italic>, a security affiliate of <italic>Manhattan </italic>NB. Since Knowlton married GE-heiress Christine Stanley in 1917, Christine\u2019s brother Harold became President of <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>of New York before becoming a <italic>Morgan </italic>partner in 1927.\nSince <italic>Seligman</italic> partner Albert Strauss married a Christian extended cousin of John Morgan and served a FRS Vice Governor, <italic>Seligman</italic> promoted Earle Bailie and Francis Randolph, both non-Jews, to partners in 1923.  Bailie, after graduating from the <italic>Uni of Minnesota</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law, lawyered at <italic>Cravath</italic> and served in Army during WWI until joining <italic>Seligman</italic> in 1919, marrying the second cousin twice removed of John Morgan Jr\u2019s wife 1923. He launched <italic>Seligman</italic>\u2019s IHC. Randolph of the Virginia Tidewater and an extended cousin of <italic>Morgan </italic>partners, also practiced law at <italic>Cravath</italic> after graduating <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law until WWI, when he worked on relief and UST efforts in Europe, and joined <italic>Seligman</italic> in 1920.\nThe communications sector was similar. Since Frederick Beer, a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, moved from Frankfurt to London, he invested in railroads, telegraphs, and the <italic>Observer</italic> newspaper. By the 1890s, Frederick\u2019s daughter-in-law Rachel Sassoon became Britain\u2019s first woman to own and edit two national newspapers, <italic>Sunday Times</italic> and her father-in-law\u2019s <italic>Observer</italic> in 1896. From Hungary, Katz-cousin Joseph Pulitzer moved to America where he eschewed religion and wed an Episcopal distant relative of former Confederate President Davis in 1878. The same year, he founded <italic>Saint-Louis Post-Dispatch</italic>, before delving into law and politics. His venture into mass-appeal journalism began in 1882 when he bought the struggling <italic>New York World</italic>, reshaping it as an advocate for democracy and social justice, particularly for the working class. \nLater, <italic>New York World </italic>hired Herbert Swope, born in Missouri to German-Jewish immigrants, including the daughter of the Chief Rabbi of Thuringia. As the Editor of <italic>New York World</italic>, Herbert won the inaugural <italic>Pulitzer Prize</italic> in 1917 for his reporting during WWI. Upon his return to America in 1920, he fortified the paper\u2019s competitive edge. He also shed light on peonage in the South and unveiled societal injustices such as the Ku Klux Klan, for which <italic>New York World</italic> won the gold medal from the board in 1922. Herbert\u2019s brother Gerard pursued electrical engineering studies at MIT and later joined <italic>Western Electric Co</italic>. From an engineer, he transitioned to sales, and became President of GE from 1922. But as Herbert Swope grew disheartened by the management of Pulitzer heirs, he departed in the late 1920s, and <italic>New York World</italic> folded in 1931.\nMirroring Pulitzer\u2019s <italic>New York World</italic>, Christian silver baron William Hearst used aggressive tactics, sensational coverage, and manufactured news to push for silver and other political agendas in the 1890s. Meanwhile, Mack family friend Adolph Ochs, born in Cincinnati in 1858 to Bavarian immigrants, worked his way up from a clerk in Knoxville. His Louisville-born cousin, Ben Ochs Franck, had followed his father in trade and later joined real estate firm with a son of Dean Richmond, President of <italic>New York Central </italic>RR. After Ochs bought the failing <italic>Chattanooga Time </italic>in 1878\u2014where his cousin Franck joined him\u2014and later married Effie, the daughter of leading reform rabbi Wise and stepdaughter of a Katz-descendant Bondi. \nAfter surviving the <italic>Panic of 1893</italic>, Ochs purchased the bankrupt <italic>New York Times</italic> in 1896 with funds from <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> and <italic>Remington Arms</italic> heir Marcellus Hartley Dodge and <italic>Equitable</italic> LIC. When Ochs wanted to avoid embarrassment when investigating LICs in 1905, he gave Dodge his 51% of <italic>Times</italic> stock as collateral for a loan to repay debts due to <italic>Equitable</italic>. For advice on the purchase in 1896, Ochs relied on San Francisco-born Alfred Cook. Having graduated from <italic>Columbia</italic> Law in 1895, he joined the law firm of <italic>Wallac</italic><italic>k</italic><italic> Cook</italic>, which evolved into <italic>Cook</italic> <italic>Nathan</italic> <italic>Lehman</italic>, through which Cook advised Ochs and served as Counsel.\nMarriages reinforced these ties. While Cook married the daughter of <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Marc Meyer in 1902, Franck\u2019s daughter later married a founder of New York broker <italic>Salomon</italic>, connected to Baltimore\u2019s Sonneborn family. By 1917, Ochs\u2019 daughter married Mack-cousin Arthur Hays Sulzberger. While Arthur\u2019s mother descended from the Revolutionary War-era Hays family, his father traced his lineage to an 18th century Rabbi of Sulzburg and a Katz (of unclear descent). Sulzberger\u2019s cousin had married a daughter of Chicago broker Abraham Becker in 1911.\nAfter the fall of <italic>New York World</italic>, <italic>New York Times</italic> was left as one of only a few prominent Jewish-owned newspapers. Along with Julius Stern (owner of <italic>New York Post</italic>, <italic>Philadelphia Record</italic>, and <italic>Camden Courier and Post</italic>, but not closely related to <italic>Stern</italic>), Paul Block (owner of the <italic>Newark Star-Eagle</italic>, <italic>Toledo Blade</italic>, <italic>Toledo Times</italic>, <italic>Duluth Herald</italic>, and <italic>News-Tribune</italic>), and Emanuel Adler (owning Midwestern <italic>Lee News</italic> syndicate), these Jewish papers had a combined daily circulation (1.4 million) in the 1930s, trailing Christian-owned <italic>Hearst</italic>, <italic>Patterson</italic>, and <italic>Scripps-Howard</italic>, with 5.5, 2.3, and 1.8 million respectably.\n<italic>Lee News</italic> started in 1899 when AW Lee expanded his publishing operations by acquiring Iowa\u2019s <italic>Davenport Times</italic>, subsequently renamed <italic>Daily Times</italic>. This consortium of independent newspapers spanned across Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Nebraska. Following AW Lee\u2019s passing in 1907, Emanuel Adler became President of <italic>Lee News</italic> and continued its expansion. In tandem, Adler established <italic>Davenport Bank & Trust Co</italic> in 1932. \nBefore Stern acquired <italic>New York Post</italic> in the 1930s, <italic>Morgan</italic> Partner Thomas Lamont owned the paper from 1918 to 1924 and supported <italic>The Saturday Review of Literature</italic> during the 1920s and 1930s. Lamont strategically cultivated the leftist paper to redirect radical impulses away from isolationism or populist nationalism toward internationalism. This strategy followed <italic>Morgan </italic>partner Willard Straight. Before dying in 1918, Straight married <italic>OIL</italic> heiress Dorothy Payne Whitney to found <italic>The New Republic</italic> in 1914.\n<italic>Patterson</italic> was started by Robert Patterson, the son of a Scottish minister, who married a daughter of Joseph Medill, founder of <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>. While their son, Joseph Medill Patterson, founded <italic>New York Daily News</italic> in 1919, the daughter Cissy became the first female publisher of a major newspaper, <italic>Washington Times-Herald</italic>, by 1930. Back in 1925, Cissy had married Elmer Schlesinger, whose sister had wed the uncle of Helen Becker Sulzberger.\nJoseph Medill\u2019s other daughter had married the heir to <italic>McCormick</italic> reapers. While one of their sons, Robert, co-founded the law firm <italic>Kirkland Ellis</italic>, another son, Joseph, wed Ruth, a daughter of <italic>COALH</italic> magnate and former Ohio Senator Marcus Converse Hanna, later becoming a senator himself. The Hannas and the Medill McCormicks also bought newspapers in Cleveland and elsewhere. After Senator Joseph Medill McCormick died in 1925, his widow Ruth won a seat in Congress and bought a newspaper herself. \nOne of the few magazines with Jewish involvement was Raoul Fleischmann\u2019s <italic>New Yorker</italic>, but led by Irish newsman Harold Ross. Nor, did Fleischmann work with Jewish bankers. After the Jewish Fleischmanns left Austria in the 1860s, they dealt yeast in Ohio. After expanding in New York City, they fused with twenty beadmakers across the country into <italic>General Baking Co </italic>in 1911 using <italic>Fisk</italic>, a former associate of <italic>Cooke</italic>. While his family formed <italic>Fleischmann</italic> in 1919 to sell yeast, Raoul Fleischmann left to launch <italic>New Yorker</italic> magazine in 1924. By 1929, <italic>Morgan </italic>fused <italic>Fleischmann</italic> into <italic>Standard Brands</italic>. While there were no Jewish book publishers until 1915, <italic>Viking</italic>, <italic>Simon Schuster</italic>, <italic>Knopf</italic>, <italic>Covici</italic>, <italic>Friede</italic>, and <italic>Random House</italic> grew by the 1930s but did not rank in size against the Christian <italic>Macmillan</italic>, <italic>Harpers</italic>, <italic>Houghton Mifflin</italic>, <italic>Doubleday</italic>, and the like.\nJews left similar impressions in the legal realm. When President Jackson promoted Roger Taney from UST to the Court in 1836, the Southerner became the first Catholic Court Justice. However, geography was a bigger factor than religion. After Taney\u2019s death in 1864, the Court remained exclusively Protestant until the appointment of Edward White, a Catholic, in 1894. White\u2019s appointment initiated a trend of appointing Catholic justices, with the so-called \u2018Catholic seat\u2019 becoming a notable feature of Court appointments. This trend also applied to the \u2018Jewish seat\u2019, which was established when Wilson appointed Louis Brandeis, a Jewish lawyer and activist, to the Court in 1916. With President Hoover appointment of Benjamin Cardozo in 1932, the Court\u2019s two Jews led the Court\u2019s liberal faction. A Seixas descendant and Katz-cousin, Cardozo\u2019s first cousin, William Hart Cardozo was elected a director of <italic>Citi Farmers Trust</italic> in 1931, after of 50 years of service.\nBefore becoming a labor lawyer in 1907, second generation Russian immigrant Julius Cohen had advocated for New York City\u2019s free public transportation transfers in 1902. Amidst WWI in 1917, Cohen innovated the British public benefit corporations into America\u2019s first\u2014and many years, only\u2014<italic>authority</italic>, <italic>Port Authority of New York & New Jersey</italic>, for multipurpose, inter-jurisdictional construction. In 1910, as large New York law firms prevented large law firms such as <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer Marshal </italic>from publicly soliciting services,<italic> </italic>Julius Cohen lamented the commercialization of the legal profession. Worrying about the rise of large law firms serving business interests, Cohen argued that such lawyers lost sight of the broader perspective and should focus on business instead. \nBut since Untermyer began supporting New York City Democrats in the 1890s, Special Counsel Samuel Untermyer concluded that there was a <italic>MONEY</italic> trust for new issues consisting of <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>First</italic> NB<italic> of New York</italic>, <italic>Kidder</italic>, and <italic>Lee Higginson</italic>. While Untermyer\u2019s law firm faded, another liberal Jewish firm with similar associations with Jewish bankers and liberal politicians was <italic>Paul Weiss</italic>\u2019 precursor. Unable to join non-Jewish law firms, Samuel Weiss formed a firm to serve his cousins, including <italic>Macy</italic>\u2019s Straus and Cullman (descended from Austrian tobacco monopolist H\u00f6nig) before WWI. \nBy 1923, Samuel\u2019s son Louis created <italic>Weiss Wharton</italic> with his Protestant <italic>Columbia </italic>Law classmate, John Wharton, to collaborate with Jews and Christians. They later merged with Samuel\u2019s firm as <italic>Cohen Cole Weiss Wharton</italic>, and gained prominence for their association with liberal politics and the Democratic party during FDR\u2019s Administration\u2019s New Deal era as <italic>Paul Weiss</italic>. At the same time, Joseph Proskauer resigned from New York State\u2019s Court in 1930 to resume private practice, <italic>Proskauer</italic> became one of Wall Street\u2019s few Jewish firms. However, his lack of political capital with FDR limited his growth. No Jew would lead either chamber of Congress until the 2010s.\nOutside of New York, prominent Jewish bankers often had similar linkages. From a long line of spiritual and civic leaders of Strasburg, Leon Loeb succeeded his cousin Marc Meyer as the French Consul for Los Angeles but resigned in 1898 in protest over the <italic>Dreyfu\u00df Affair</italic>. Loeb took over Meyer\u2019s dry goods store, renaming it <italic>The City of Paris</italic>. In 1908, he co-founded the law firm <italic>Kuster</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic>, which initially handled a variety of legal matters. In 1914, the firm was renamed <italic>Loeb</italic> <italic>Walker</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic> when the Christian Irving Walker joined, and reverted to <italic>Loeb</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic>, in 1938 after Walker departed. Edwin Loeb, Leon\u2019s son, represented major studios like <italic>Universal</italic>, <italic>Warner Bros</italic>, MGM, and others, helping to shape the entertainment industry in Los Angeles. Several lawyers from the firm, including Martin Gang and George Cohen, went on to establish influential firms.\n<italic>Kuster</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic> secured strategic connections through family ties. While Loeb\u2019s cousin Kaspare Cohn started a savings bank that became <italic>Union Bank of California</italic>, Kuster\u2019s uncle, William Kerckhoff, co-founded <italic>Pacific Light & Power Co</italic>. California\u2019s wool commissions agent Cohn established close ties with Basque shepherds and operated as a de facto banker, accepting deposits and extending loans, state authorities prompted him to formalize his operations. In response, Cohn founded <italic>Cohn Commercial & Savings Bank</italic> in 1914. This bank notably financed initiatives such as <italic>San Gabriel Light & Power Co</italic> and early iterations of what would become <italic>Pacific Lighting Corp</italic>. Cohn passed away in 1916, succeeded by Ben Meyer, who oversaw the bank\u2019s rebranding to <italic>Union Bank & Trust Co</italic> in 1918. \nA graduate of UCLA and the <italic>Hastings College of Law</italic>, Emanuel Heller\u2019s father descended from the last Bavarian regional rabbi and immigrated to America in 1850s. His California law firm, <italic>Heller</italic> <italic>Ehrman</italic>, kinterlinked with <italic>Wells Fargo\u2019</italic>s Isaiah Hellman, an in-law of Seligman and Lehman. In 1932, Esther Hellman Ehrman married Claude Lazard in a Catholic ceremony and her cousin Fred Ehrman, who had joined <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1929, married Edith Koshland. By 1934, Edith\u2019s sister, Ruth, married Isaiah Hellman\u2019s grandson Marco. \nMore common were small firms. After managing sugar estates in Kiew, Ukraine, alongside Katz-Brodsky interests, the Pritzker family fled Russian antisemitism to America. While his family opened a family grocery store in Chicago, Nicholas matriculated <italic>Illinois College of Law</italic> and founded <italic>Pritzker</italic> law firm by 1902. After his two brothers graduated <italic>Northwestern Uni</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law School, they joined him. Among the <italic>Pritzker</italic>\u2019s largest clients was <italic>Goldblatt</italic>, a discount Chicago department started by Polish Jews in 1913. \nJewish lawyers worked in fields unfavored by Protestants or those linked to commercial activities like textiles where Jews were active. Working as solo practitioners or small firms, Jews focused on in bankruptcy, real estate, negligence, divorce, collections, and general litigation. As Protestants preferred routine over adversarial courtroom practice, Jews steered judicial decisions away from the traditional principles of Anglo-Saxon law. Instead, Protestant firms dominated banking, insurance, trusts, and other investment and large corporation matters, often devoid of Jewish partners despite serving Jewish clients. Most elite Wall Street law firms in New York refused to hire Jews. <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s law firm, <italic>Davis Polk</italic>, did not promote a Jew partner until 1961. \nMore than just <italic>Yale</italic> or <italic>Harvard</italic>, <italic>Davis Polk</italic> and other \u2018white shoe\u2019 firms hired \u2018Social Register\u2019 individuals, many of whom had attended <italic>Groton</italic> or <italic>Hotchkiss</italic> and other prep schools. White Anglo-Saxon Protestants with religious ties dominated New York\u2019s elite law firms in representing corporations before governmental bodies using preacher-like oration. Since Francis Stetson, <italic>Davis Polk</italic>\u2019s named partners included a Russell and a Gardiner. \nPaul Cravath informed <italic>Harvard</italic> Law students that: \u201c<italic>Brilliant intellectual powers are not essential. Too much imagination, too much wit, too great cleverness, too facile fluency, if not leavened by a sound sense of proportion, are quite as likely to impede success as to promote it. The best clients are apt to be afraid of those qualities. They want as their counsel a man who is primarily honest, safe, sound and steady</italic>.\u201d\nAlthough his ancestor played a role in founding <italic>Yale</italic>, John Morgan\u2019s son, Jack, was the first in the family to graduate from <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1889. By the \u201830s, <italic>Harvard</italic> alumni at <italic>Morgan </italic>included Elliot Bacon, Junius Morgan II, Thomas Lamont, and Henry Morgan; all also related to senior partners. Harold Stanley, Russell Leffingwell, William Ewing, and Henry Davison Jr attended <italic>Yale</italic>. Except for Davison, <italic>Yale</italic> attendees had no connections to other <italic>Morgan </italic>partners. Two other partners graduated from <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic>, traditionally affiliated with <italic>Drexel</italic>, with only Dwight Morrow from <italic>Amherst</italic>.\nIn the early generations of <italic>Kuhn</italic> partners, university education was uncommon, but exceptions include James Loeb, who graduated from <italic>Harvard</italic> (B.A. 1888). Three sons of Felix Warburg and Frieda\u2014daughter of Jacob Schiff\u2014attended <italic>Harvard</italic>, including Frederick (B.A. 1919), Gerald (B.A. 1923), and Edward (B.A. 1930). Mortimer Schiff wanted to send his son John to <italic>Harvard</italic>, but his father Jacob refused due to concerns about its temptations. Faced with discrimination at <italic>Harvard</italic>, Jewish heirs Eugene Lehman (B.A. 1902, M.A. 1909), Joseph Seligman (B.A. 1908), Arthur Lehman Goodhart (B.A. 1912), and Robert Lehman (B.A. 1913) attended <italic>Yale</italic>. By the 1930s, three <italic>Kuhn</italic> partners graduated <italic>Yale</italic>.\n<italic>Morgan </italic>did not share kinship or partnerships with any Jewish bank until the 1930s. Dwight Morrow, who was born in West Virginia into a Presbyterian Irish family, began his legal career by joining <italic>Simpson Thatcher</italic> after graduating from law school in 1899. Notably, one of his early cases involved representing Utah\u2019s PU in a legal battle against President Roosevelt\u2019s <italic>Federal Forest Reserve</italic>. By 1914, Morrow\u2019s exceptional abilities caught the attention of <italic>Morgan</italic>, leading to his recruitment. After his classmate Calvin Coolidge assumed the presidency in 1923, Morrow became the Ambassador to Mexico in 1927, improving relations between America and Mexico.\nMorrow\u2019s popularity soared when his daughter married aviator Charles Lindbergh in 1929. Despite being considered a potential candidate for the presidency, Morrow was elected to the Senate by the state of New Jersey. However, tragically, his life was cut short when he passed away in 1931. Before relations with American deteriorated, Mexico expelled thousands of Chinese families, including those born locally. (Several states forbid Chinese men from marrying Mexican women.)\nMeanwhile, having fled Irish anti-Protestant repression in 1778, the Dulles family included missionaries, theologians, and clergy. Born in 1888 to a second-generation Presbyterian minister and a great-nephew of SBUS President Langdon Cheves, John Dulles\u2019 maternal grandfather, John Foster, helped elect Republican presidents and was President Harrison\u2019s Secretary of State by 1892. \nDespite graduating from a second-tier school, John Dulles married Janet Avery Pomeroy\u2014an extended cousin of Rockefeller\u2019s Avery and <italic>Banker Trusts\u2019</italic> Pomeroy families\u2014, and, along with his brother Allan, joined <italic>Sullivan</italic>. By 1923, <italic>Sullivan </italic>hired Episcopalian Arthur Dean, who helped Dulles to become the largest law firm in the world and represent American investments in Europe, including <italic>Solvay</italic>, <italic>Farben</italic>, <italic>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</italic>, and the Wertheim cousin-in-law Petschek\u2019s Czech enterprises. \nBut <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s reputation allowed for diversity. Along with Sullivan\u2019s son George in 1884, Senior Partner William Cromwell hired George\u2019s exceptional Jewish classmate, Alfred Jaretzki, who became Managing Partner after Cromwell\u2019s death. By 1914, <italic>Sullivan </italic>hired Eustice<italic> </italic>Seligman, son of <italic>Columbia </italic>economics Professor Edwin Selgiman. Within three years, Eustice married Jaretzki\u2019s daughter. While <italic>Sullivan </italic>soon had the most Jewish partners at a Wall Street law firm, all were related to Jaretzki. \nAlthough several <italic>Columbia </italic>Law<italic> </italic>graduate Seligman cousins started <italic>Seligman Seligman </italic>in the 1880s, the firm liquidated by 1920. Like the Seligmans, the Lehmans also battled for justice. After earning <italic>Columbia </italic>Law, Irving Newgass Lehman served at the law firm of <italic>Marshall Moran Williams McVicker</italic> and later <italic>Worcester Williams Lehman </italic>before his first election to New York\u2019s Court in 1908.\nFrom a long line of rabbis, Felix Frankfurter\u2019s uncle married a Katz-descendant and briefly led <italic>Vienna Uni Library</italic>. After graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> Law and advocating for laborers, Felix represented the cause for a Jewish Israel at the request of Justice Brandeis. But Judaism was not central to his life. He soon married the daughter of a congregationalist minister, co-founded the <italic>American Civil Liberties Union</italic>, and advised the <italic>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</italic> (\u201cNAACP\u201d). \nBy 1921, he became a Chair at <italic>Harvard</italic> Law and continued advocating progressivism. The <italic>Naval Academy</italic> displayed an extreme of discrimination and exclusion. Leonard Kaplan, a Jewish student in 1922, endured four years of isolation and mistreatment from classmates. He was ridiculed in the yearbook with a derogatory cartoon and biography, with his page designed to be torn out. While military nepotism continued\u2014with Patton and other dynastic generals\u2014the State Department failed Jews who had done well on written examinations in their oral interviews.\nSince <italic>Columbia</italic>\u2019s charter called for religious representation in the 1780s, the first American-born rabbi Sephardi, Gershom Mendes Seixas, became trustee but was not replaced after his retirement. Only a few German and Sephardi Jews flourished there. One of them was Edwin Seligman graduated <italic>Columbia </italic>College in 1879 and helped form <italic>American Economic Association</italic> in 1885. As <italic>Columbia</italic> denied Jacob Schiff a trusteeship, he funded a Germanic studies department at <italic>Cornell</italic>. Finally, Annie Nathan\u2014a great-granddaughter of Gershom and cousin-in-law of Edwin\u2014asked Schiff to fundraise for a women\u2019s college at <italic>Columbia</italic>. \nSince Schiff funded <italic>Barnard College </italic>and a fund for <italic>Columbia</italic>\u2019s debts in 1888, <italic>Columbia </italic>appointed him a director and treasurer of <italic>Barnard</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Columbia</italic> hired four Jewish professors. In 1888, Edwin Seligman was appointed Adjunct Professor of Political Economy at <italic>Columbia</italic>, and he became Professor of Political Economy from 1904 until his retirement in 1931. By 1907, <italic>Columbia</italic> Medical hired <italic>Baruch</italic>\u2019s father Simon Baruch\u2014the first doctor to diagnose and treat a ruptured appendix and advance the treatment of malaria, childhood diseases, and typhoid fever\u2014as Chair of Hydrotherapy. His son Baruch later led the <italic>War Industries Board</italic> during WWI.\nWhen dollar diplomacy failed, Alongside <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> brother-in-law Louis Marshall, Jacob Schiff lobbied for legislative changes to ensure Jewish representation. Complaining to New York Mayor George McClellan that quasi-public and taxpayer funded institutions did not have Jewish trustees in 1909, they drafted bills to mandate Jewish inclusion, proposing that the mayor have the authority to appoint trustees. After the Mayor asked <italic>Metropolitan Museum of Art</italic>\u2019s Chair John Morgan to add a Jew to the board, Morgan accepted a resignation and filled the vacancy with <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s George Blumenthal, who donated over $1 million over his term. Within Schiff\u2019s lifetime, <italic>New York Public Library</italic> and <italic>American Museum of Natural History</italic> also elected Jewish trustees, the latter adding Schiff\u2019s son-in-law Felix Warburg as her first Jewish director. Blaming Warburg and Untermyer for his father\u2019s death later, John Morgan Jr grew antisemitic.\nLikewise, Schiff bridged divides with Christians and demonstrated his commitment to justice through donations to restore Catholic shrines in Cuba. While he supported civil rights by endorsing Booker T. Washington and played a founding role in <italic>National Association for the Advancement of Colored People </italic>(\u201cNAACP\u201d), his in-law, Paul Warburg, served as a <italic>Tuskegee Institute</italic> trustee.\nFollowing WWI, Jewish scholars from Eastern Europe began joining American economics faculties. Jacob Viner, a <italic>Harvard</italic> graduate from Montreal, became a Professor at <italic>Uni of Chicago</italic> in 1925. Leo Sharfman, originally from Russia and arriving via Tientsin, became a professor (later Chair) at <italic>Uni of Michigan</italic>. However, old-stock Protestant Americans turned nativist due to perceived internal alien threats and President Woodrow Wilson\u2019s failed international efforts. They shifted focus from global affairs, reaffirming loyalty to their Anglo-Saxon \u2018tribe\u2019 and imposing restrictive practices, including quotas, to block newcomers from <italic>Harvard</italic>, <italic>Yale</italic>, <italic>Princeton</italic>,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Columbia</italic> universities and other institutions. \nThese practices aligned with 1920s immigration restrictions and hindered immigrant advancement. Still, in the 1930s, more Russian Jews joined major economics faculty positions, including Simon Kuznets at <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> and future FRS Chair Arthur (Burnseig) Burns at <italic>Rutgers Uni</italic>. However, resistance to Jewish appointments persisted. In 1940, antisemitic reasons led to Milton Friedman\u2019s denial of tenure at the <italic>Uni of Wisconsin</italic>. Similarly, despite being one of <italic>Harvard</italic>\u2019s top economics graduates, Paul Samuelson wasn\u2019t appointed at <italic>Harvard</italic> after earning his doctorate. Samuelson went to MIT, where he helped establish a department that rivaled <italic>Harvard</italic>. \nDiscrimination was similar in medicine. Of the 14 thousand annually applicants to America\u2019s 76 reputable medical schools in the 1930s, 50% were Jews, with only 17% of the admitted 6 thousand being Jewish. Like with law, New York City hospital boards were mostly Christian, although tension diminished elsewhere except for competitive roles. <italic>Uni of Minnesota </italic>found it impossible to place Jewish women in dental hygiene.\nJewish emancipation progressed faster in Germany than America. In the 1880s, the percentage of Jewish attorneys in Prussia increased significantly from 7 to 20%, reaching 27% in 1904. Jewish lawyers continued to integrate after WWI. By the 1920s, Jews accounted for almost a third of attorneys and notaries in Prussia. That said, of the 7,500 bankers and brokers active in Germany in 1925, only 3.3% were Jewish. \nOf those, an even small contingent held vast sway over the German economy as private bankers held significant influence in corporate financing through board seats and industrial consortia. Private banks were indispensable in bond issuances and industrial consortia, with their involvement reaching 40% in companies like <italic>Kl\u00f6ckner</italic>. By 1932, private bankers occupied 1,052 out of 3,397 bank board seats, making up 31% of the total. Jews played a key role. \n<italic>Warburg</italic> held 94 mandates in 1925, including 29 by Max Warburg himself, which increased to 102 by 1928. <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, with 79 mandates in 1921, chaired boards for key companies in coal and mining, such as <italic>Hubertus Braunkohlen</italic> and <italic>Ph\u00f6nix</italic>, which later became part of <italic>Vereinigte</italic> <italic>Stahlwerke</italic>. <italic>Oppenheim</italic>-affiliated <italic>Levy</italic>\u2019s Louis Hagen had no fewer than 63, mainly with electro-industrial firms. <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> held 90 mandates in sectors like cement and shipping, while <italic>Aufh\u00e4user</italic> of Munich managed 50 in Bavaria\u2019s industries. \n<italic>Arnhold</italic>, with 147 corporate participations by the early 1930s, held 119 mandates in brewing and electrical industries. While <italic>Danat</italic> representatives held board seats in a quarter of Germany\u2019s 100 largest companies with double representation on the boards of GGE, <italic>Linke Hoffmann Busch</italic>, and brewer <italic>Schultheiss Patzenhofer </italic><italic>Ostwerke</italic>, Jakob Goldsmith was Deputy Chair of steelworks <italic>Vereinigte</italic> and <italic>Mitteldeutsche</italic>, <italic>Schultheiss Patzenhofer</italic>, and the potash combine <italic>Aschersleben</italic>. \nWhile Christian banks would not hire Jews, they did hire Christian minorities. By 1922, George Fauty, born in American to Syrian immigrants, joined <italic>Chase</italic> NB after parish priest provided a letter confirming his religion as evidence that he was not Jewish. Since  1891, George Faour and his brothers started <italic>Faour</italic>, the first Syrian-owned American bank, in Manhattan, after working in linen in Boston. <italic>Faour</italic> served Syrian immigrants in Little Syria, but increasingly faced competition from <italic>Lebanon</italic> NB and others.\nMore than religious and racial minorities, American law firms discriminated against women along with their clients and law schools. Although <italic>Yale</italic> Law accepted a woman in 1877, admission was subsequently banned until 1918. While <italic>Harvard Law </italic>did not accept women until 1950, <italic>Harvard </italic>College was not co-ed until merging with <italic>Radcliffe </italic>College in 1963. \n<italic>Sullivan </italic>was one of the first New York law firms to hire women under Dulles in 1930, but they were only given minor roles and not promoted to partnership. Helen Lewisohn Lehman\u2014Arthur\u2019s cousin and wife of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Benjamin Buttenwieser\u2014was<italic> </italic>one of the first females admitted to the New York Bar and to work at <italic>Cravath</italic>. She represented children and argued before the Court while working there for a year before chairing the <italic>Legal Aid Society</italic>.\nFemale bankers fared only a little better. Meanwhile, women began to make inroads in American banking. This shift began around 1906 when women took on clerical roles in New York banks, with some advancing to positions of responsibility. In 1907 when Virginia Furman established the first dedicated women\u2019s department at <italic>Columbia Trust</italic>, offering tailored financial services to women. Her exceptional leadership inspired the creation of similar women-centric departments. Moreover, women in select Western banks even attained esteemed titles like presidents and vice presidents, exemplifying a progressive approach. As a woman became treasurer of <italic>Union Trust Co of Rochester</italic>, <italic>Association of Bank Women</italic> emerged. \nOne of the most notable female bankers was Nathalie Laimbeer. Born in New York in 1880, she divorced her husband and the father of her children. After marrying again, she found herself widowed by 1913. During WWI, Nathalie dedicated her efforts to food conservation at Hoover\u2019s <italic>Food Administration</italic>. From 1919, she led the women\u2019s department of <italic>US Mortgage & Trust</italic>. Initially entrusted with overseeing a single office, her responsibilities expanded within six months to attract female clients across Manhattan. \nBy 1925, Nathalie left to start <italic>Citi</italic> Women and become the bank\u2019s first female executive and assistant cashier. While she became the inaugural woman to address the <italic>American Bankers\u2019 Association</italic> and led the <italic>Association of Bank Women</italic>, Nathalie died in 1926 due to heart disease. Her sister, Josephine Laimbeer, married John Fell\u2014a Christian, whose father descended from Anthony Drexel, mother was a Randolph, and stepfather was future UST Secretary Ogden Livingston Mills under President Hoover\u2014in 1931. While Fell joined <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1937,  Laimbeer married future <italic>Kuhn</italic> senior partner John Schiff after Fell\u2019s death in 1961.\nEuropean examples of female-only banks Berlin\u2019s <italic>Frauenbank</italic> from 1910 and a department at the Paris branch of <italic>Equitable Trust </italic>of New York. Since <italic>Shell</italic> heiress Henri\u00e9tte Deterding became the first woman on <italic>Amsterdam Stock Exchange</italic> in 1923, <italic>Rotterdam Bank</italic> opened <italic>Vrouwenbank</italic>, a branch in Amsterdam for women run by women, by 1928. Clara Meijers, a Dutch Jew who began her career as a secretary at <italic>Amsterdam Bank</italic>, <italic>Vrouwenbank</italic> survived until 1971, when it became obsolete after another wave of feminism. Aside from commercial banking, Isabel Benham, born to a Presbyterian Reverend in Buffalo, New York, graduated <italic>Bryn Mawr</italic> and trained with a bond school run by a <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> affiliate 1931 before becoming a railroad expert at <italic>Pressprich</italic>.\nAlthough widows mostly withdrew from European corporate business since the middle-19th century, there were several to have led a corporation before <italic>Pearson</italic> in 1997. Having helped <italic>Morgan </italic>form <italic>SHIP</italic> at the turn of the century as the head of Belfast-based firm <italic>Harland Wolff</italic>, Irishman William Pirrie engaged in Belfast\u2019s new Parliament from 1922. After his death in 1924, his wife Margaret Pirrie became the President of <italic>Harland Wolff </italic>until her death in 1935. Likewise, after Belgian banker <italic>Lambert</italic>\u2019s Henri Rothschild Lambert died in 1933, his widow Johanna Reininghaus Lambert became Chair of the bank. And in Vienna, the death of Hans Reitzes in 1935 allowed his aristocratic Christian widow, Maria Marienwert, to inherit <italic>Reitzes</italic>, and invest in <italic>Upper Austrian Starch </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Chemical Industry</italic>.\n\n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Eurasian </italic><italic>Panics of </italic><italic>the 1930s</italic>\nSince the <italic>Treaty of Versailles</italic> and <italic>Treaty of Trianon</italic> of 1920, the multi-ethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire lost her coal and oil colonies to Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other successor nations, and isolating Jews. Before WWI, Silesian coal drove Austrian energy. After <italic>Versailles</italic>, Austria drilled for oil. As a public PU developed hydroelectricity in the Alps, which GGE sought to expand. By 1920, <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Schneider</italic> founded <italic>Union Europ\u00e9enne Industrielle </italic>to invest in <italic>\u0160koda</italic> and develop coal and electricity in Czechoslovakia. Along with financing Czech mines, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna invested in Polish banks as the state-controlled coal. \nAs pre-WWI <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic> co-investors, Czech coaler Petschek established their own bank and acquired <italic>Starck Mining & Industry </italic>in 1917 and founded <italic>Aussiger Mining </italic>in 1920. While French banks drilled for Polish oil, <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>OIL</italic> split German and Hungarian capital participations as Romanian investment bank <italic>Marmorosch </italic>into Romanian and French hands. By 1926, <italic>Kuhn </italic>and BOE consolidated Austria\u2019s state debt into <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna with Warburg\u2019s <italic>International Acceptance</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>. \nWhat did not go into <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, went into the new <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank. </italic>The latter reorged into <italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak Bank</italic>, the Czechoslovak government\u2019s reluctance, and the partial sale of shares by <italic>Anglo-International Bank</italic>, a syndicate led by local investor Petschek, entered <italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak Bank</italic>. \nHaving raised capital from <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Solvay</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Creusot</italic>\u2019s Schneider, Vienna\u2019s <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic>  acquired <italic>Union Bank of Bohemia</italic> and <italic>Allgemeine Verkehrsbank </italic>in 1927. Since Eugene Schneider joined <italic>\u00d6sterreichische</italic>\u2019s board in 1924, the latter merged with <italic>Union Bank of Bohemia</italic> led their Polish affiliates\u2014<italic>Bank Ma</italic><italic>l</italic><italic>opolski</italic> and <italic>Union Bank of </italic><italic>Poland</italic>\u2014to merge under Chair Janusz Radziwill, whose cousin married a Wendel that year.  While <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> offered to buy BOE\u2019s <italic>Anglo-International Bank</italic> shares in 1928, Montague Norman declined.\nBanks also consolidated in Yugoslavia. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1925, Slavic </italic>and other banks failed, leading to reorgs. By 1928, <italic>Wiener</italic>\u2019s Croatian Zagreb and Serbian Belgrade branches merged into the independent <italic>General Yugoslav Bank</italic>,<italic> </italic>with investment from Belgian <italic>Banque Belge pour l\u2019Etranger</italic> and Swiss <italic>Basler Handelsbank</italic> to gain control of <italic>Country Bank for Bosnia-Hercegovina</italic>. \nBy then, <italic>Croatian-Slavonian Mortgage Bank</italic> raised investment from Belgian <italic>Solvay</italic>, British <italic>Lazard</italic> London, Austrian <italic>Ephrussi</italic>, and German <italic>Disconto</italic>, shifting away from Hungarian control. After <italic>Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>International Bank</italic>\u2019s Boltan Hajdu joined <italic>Croatian Discount Bank</italic>\u2019s board in 1927,<italic> </italic><italic>Croatian Discount Bank</italic> merged <italic>Croatian-Slavonian Mortgage Bank</italic><italic> </italic>in 1928, and then merged with <italic>Bosnian Bank</italic> and <italic>Agrar & Commercial Bank</italic> to create <italic>Yugoslav Union Bank</italic>. \nIn 1929, <italic>Yugoslav Union Bank</italic> absorbed <italic>Banque Agricole et Industrielle</italic> and soon held stakes in banks in Slovenia and Macedonia, including <italic>Adria-Danube Bank</italic>, and <italic>Control Bank for Commerce & Industry</italic>\u2014the cartel for Croat industry\u2014along with firms in transport, steel, insurance, and industry. Unlike with other Yugoslav banks, <italic>Yugoslav Union Bank</italic> had Jewish representation, including General Manager Oscar Barth\u2014whose second cousin married into families that were cousins of the Porges and the Kornfeld families\u2014and the \u2018Serbian Rothschild\u2019 Edja Buli as a director. \nWith Europe weakening, FRS eased rates in 1927, German NYSE borrowing resumed. As French creditors repatriated gold from Britain, MOF promised to moderate flows. Since MOF taxed foreign <italic>Paris Stock Exchange</italic> listings to limit capital export, MMMOF grew, and lower rates deflated MSBs and exports. While BDF facilitated MMMOF, MOF ordered BDF to buy gold to make the <italic>franc</italic> convertible. So, BDF joined NYSE as a gold sinkhole, deflating German and British debt. \nAmidst calls to sell French colonies to raise capital around the <italic>franc</italic> crisis in the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>, Octave Homberg advocated for state investment in their development. He argued that colonies were crucial to France\u2019s unity and should be integrated fully into the national framework. Homberg\u2019s policy aimed to strengthen the connection between France and its overseas territories. Since marrying Octave Hoburg Jr's sister-in-law in 1905, Christian civil servant Ren\u00e9 Chaume joined <italic>Indochine</italic> as in 1909, and progressed to Director by 1920. By then, Octave Jr, a Director of <italic>Indochine</italic> and President of <italic>Indochina Water & Electricity </italic>and <italic>Indochinese Electricity</italic> founded <italic>French & Colonial </italic>HC. Along with rubber and Far Eastern business, <italic>French & Colonial </italic>took an interest in equatorial Africa companies.\nAs Homberg\u2019s <italic>French & Colonial </italic>HC collaborated with <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and <italic>Worms</italic>, Hypolite Worms expanded merchant banking under his cousin Andr\u00e9 Meyer\u2019s guidance. During WWI, <italic>Worms </italic>formed subsidiaries and invested in various businesses. By 1921, Hypolite also expanded across Europe, joining <italic>Franco-Polish Chamber of Commerce</italic> and <italic>Lyon Water & Lighting </italic>to found <italic>Norman Water, Gas & Electric</italic>.  \nBy 1925, <italic>French & Colonial</italic>, Edmond Estaing\u2019s<italic> Indochinese Rubber Co</italic>, and <italic>Zarifi </italic>formed <italic>Indochinese Tropical Crops Co</italic>. While the partnership with the <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and <italic>Homberg</italic> ended amicably in 1926, <italic>Worms </italic>participated in creating <italic>French & Foreign Investing Corp</italic> in Canada and Hypolite became President of <italic>Real Estate Union for France</italic>, a venture with <italic>Worms</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> by 1929. Since his brother married a Rothschild, Christian Jean Thierry of Marseille became auditor of<italic> French & Colonial</italic>. Likewise, a niece of the wives of <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s Ren\u00e9 Chaume and Octave Hoburg Jr wed Fran\u00e7ois Flers\u2014who soon joined <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2014as his father was a director of <italic>Transatlantique</italic>. Chaume led <italic>Indochine</italic> in the 1930s. \nAnother Lazard-in-law, Pierre Wertheim, had served in WWI with his brother until joining Belgian grain trading cousins, <italic>Fribourg</italic>, to found <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Emboutissage & de Constructions M\u00e9caniques</italic> in 1916. As Coco Chanel developed the <italic>Chanel No 5</italic> fragrance in 1921, Parisian department store <italic>Galeries Lafayette</italic> introduced her to Wertheim. Recognizing the potential of Chanel\u2019s creation, Wertheim fully funded the venture and established <italic>Parfums Chanel</italic> in 1924. As <italic>Parfums Chanel</italic> thrived, introducing iconic fragrances like <italic>Soir de Paris</italic> in collaboration with <italic>Bourjois</italic>, Coco Chanel continued to operate her fashion studio, creating timeless designs that revolutionized women\u2019s clothing. After signing away her name for 10% equity, her relationship with the Wertheim family as she unsuccessfully fought to renegotiate the contract. \nSince 1896, Benjamin Rossier of<italic> Franco-Swiss Bank</italic>\u2014renamed <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic> in 1917\u2014had a friend of <italic>Galeries Lafayette</italic>, which he supported through capital increases in 1909 and 1912 and joining her board from 1910. With Wertheim\u2019s investment, <italic>Galeries </italic>saw substantial growth under the leadership of Lazard and Dreyfu\u00df cousin-in-law Th\u00e9ophile Bader and, after his death, his son-in-law Raoul Meyer. By 1914, the department store employed over 1,000 people and had a thriving mail-order operation. Along with branching to Nice (1916), Lyon (1919), Montpellier, Nantes and Vichy (1926) within France, At the same time, <italic>Galeries </italic>opened offices abroad, starting with London in 1920, then Madrid (1922), Alexandria (1923), and so on. By 1930, <italic>Galeries </italic>was France\u2019s second-largest department store HC.\nLikewise, family firms managed by the Christian descendants of their founders dominated European business. In Germany, August Finck succeeded his father in heading private bank <italic>Merck Finck</italic> and the boards of <italic>Munich Re</italic> and <italic>Allianz</italic> by 1925, driving Germany\u2019s postwar export recovery and Europe\u2019s largest LIC. Since, Carl Siemens led <italic>Siemens</italic>. Fritz Thyssen chaired <italic>Vereinigte </italic><italic>Stahlwerke</italic>. In France, Eugene Schneider, Fran\u00e7ois Wendel, and Robert Peugeot headed their family firms. \nAs Alfred Mond chaired Britain\u2019s<italic> Imperial Chemical Industries</italic> until 1930, Rupert Guinness, Samuel Courtauld, and Walter Samuel led<italic> Guinness</italic>, <italic>Courtauld</italic>,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Shell</italic>, although family ownership diluted. Like Henri Germain\u2019s son-in-law George Brincard chaired <italic>Credit Lyonnais</italic> from 1922 to 1945, Gustav Krupp Bohlen led <italic>Krupp</italic>. A few even kinterlinked with Jews. Since Rothschild\u2019s cousin May Ephrussi married the Prince of Lucinge in 1901, his niece wed the grandson of <italic>Lyonnais</italic> founder Henri Germain in 1928.\nFrom 1928, the strong <italic>franc</italic> allowed investors to industrialize Indochina and MOF to subsidize rural PUs domestically. While European and Chinese interests dominated the Indochinese economy during the French colonial period, some Vietnamese elites found success. L\u00ea V\u0103n C\u1ed1ng, after working in French banks in Hankow and Tientsin from 1919 to 1926, became director of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Annamite de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> by 1932, supporting local businesses. Among the elite, the majority were landowners. One of the wealthiest, Truong Van Ben, founded a rice mill and oil mill around 1918 and a soap factory in 1932. From 1925 to 1932, he directed <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Rizicole de Th\u00e1p M\u01b0\u1eddi</italic>, managing 10,000 hectares, and in 1931, owned 18,000 hectares.\nVietnamese landowners benefited from agricultural unions designed to counter Chinese commercial dominance. Regional <italic>Syndicat Agricole</italic> unions, founded in provinces like M\u1ef9 Tho, Long Xuy\u00ean, and Can Tho from 1912, protected local landowners\u2019 interests, while <italic>Syndicat National des Riziculteurs</italic> promoted rice producers across Indochina. Many elites participated in these unions and colonial institutions. Nguyen T\u1ea5n D\u01b0\u1ee3c founded a <italic>Syndicat Agricole</italic> in 1918 and served in <italic>Chambre d\u2019Agriculture</italic> from 1925 to 1938 and <italic>Grand Conseil des Int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00c9conomiques et Financiers de l\u2019Indochine</italic> from 1929 to 1937. Despite Vietnamese involvement, these councils remained under French control.\nIn 1927, <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles</italic>\u2019 Ernest Mercier proposed a nationalist oil policy to President Poincar\u00e9 to enhance French control over oil production, refining, and transport, which led to <italic>P\u00e9troles</italic> securing Iraqi crude oil. While Mercier and refiner <italic>Desmarais</italic> pushed for a joint refining subsidiary with <italic>P\u00e9troles</italic>, <italic>Petrofina</italic> aimed to develop independent refineries. \nAt the same time, the Soviet Union exported more oil, coal, and timber, posing competition to French interests, while French-funded ventures in Romania and Poland collapsed. Amidst these challenges, France sought to solidify its influence in global oil markets by organizing a global oil cartel in 1928. In May 1929, the French government intervened to strengthen national oil policy by increasing the state\u2019s stake in <italic>P\u00e9troles</italic> and requiring distributors to source 25% of their sales from the company.  \nBy September 1929, <italic>\u00d6sterreichische Bodencredit</italic> faced collapse due to an imbalance between assets and loans after expanding through the 1920s. As <italic>\u00d6sterreichische </italic>struggled with liquidity and raising capital, <italic>Austrian National Bank</italic> intervened to facilitate a merger with <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> in October<italic>.</italic> While <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 <italic>Romanian Credit </italic>faced a liquidity shortfall in 1929, <italic>Marmorosch </italic>encountered asset immobilization problems in 1930. \nDespite challenges, <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Finaly declined an offer from America\u2019s <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> to buy <italic>Romanian Credit </italic>at a premium. Soon after, British <italic>Vickers</italic> secured a 13.3% stake in <italic>Re\u0219i\u021ba</italic> steelworks through a share syndicate with <italic>Romanian Credit</italic>, <italic>Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103</italic>, <italic>Chrissoveloni </italic>of<italic> Romanian Commercial Bank</italic>, and <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, which interlocked directors with <italic>Re\u0219i\u021ba</italic>. Likewise, Boden-controlled oil bank <italic>Ma</italic><italic>l</italic><italic>opolski </italic>of Krakau merged with <italic>Creditanstalt\u2019</italic>s Polish affiliate,<italic> Warsaw Discount Bank</italic>, transferred her mortgage operations, and closed most branches.\nAt the time, Herbert Lawrence chaired <italic>Vickers</italic>. The son of a baron, he was commissioned into the military, serving on the intelligence staff during the South African War. In 1892 he wed a daughter of <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s Charles Mills, a cousin of the Grenfells. He resigned in 1903, joining <italic>Glyn </italic>in 1907. After WWI, he saw his daughter marry a Smyth in 1923, and became Chair of <italic>Vickers</italic> in 1926, where he oversaw connections with <italic>Creusot</italic> in France, <italic>Mitsui</italic> in Japan, and subsidiaries in Canada, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Rumania, Holland, and France. In 1928,<italic> </italic><italic>Vickers</italic> and <italic>British Thomson-Houston</italic> came under <italic>Associated Electrical Industries</italic> (\u201cAEI\u201d), the American GE controlled HC, but remained non-integrated. By 1934 he was Chair of <italic>Glyn</italic>, <italic>Bank of Rumania</italic>, and <italic>TURK</italic>\u2019s London Committee, with directorships in AEI and other companies.\nLike with <italic>Petrofina</italic>, Belgium, rebuilt war-ravaged electricity by giving tax relief to Belgian BHCs for investments in domestic and international banks and PUHCs. While electricity accelerated coal and agricultural deflation globally, German agricultural tariffs protected GLB bonds. Although GRS allowed GRB to make markets for and discount limited GRS bonds, which started in 1928. While GRS aided Junkers with tariffs and wage earners with unemployment insurance, their new insolvency law limited write-downs. \nAt the turn of the turn of the century, German investors in Italian mercury unsuccessfully sought a cartel with <italic>Rothschild</italic> and Spain. During WWI, the Germans sold the mines to a Swiss HC\u2014and subsequently <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic>\u2014and the British Government supervised a cartel between Spanish and Italian producers. While Italy acquired more mercury mines from Austria after the war,<italic> Rothschild</italic> refused to resume the cartel. Spain did not renew <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s contract during the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, thus nationalizing exports. \nBy 1925, Spain decided to sell almost its entire mercury output through open auction, which <italic>Rothschild</italic> did not attend. The winner of the auction was a JV of <italic>Lazard</italic> and<italic> Paribas</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic><italic>Banco Espa\u00f1ol de Cr\u00e9dito</italic>. In 1928, Spain, Italy, and their bankers formed a Swiss cartel for international mercury sales to harmonize production and control prices. To prevent a surplus, producers fire sold their stock, particularly to <italic>Lazard</italic>. Within a year, the cartel converted purchasers in each country into commission agents, mainly German <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic>, Japanese <italic>Mitsubishi</italic>, Italian <italic>Leghorn</italic>, and British <italic>Roura</italic>. Still, demand fell as American production continued per AA1890.\nSince his cousin married Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s second great-grandson in 1900, Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn married Georgina Bingen\u2014a cousin of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s deceased FX specialist Eug\u00e8ne Mehler and a descendant of Rabbi Judah Lowe, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, and Michael Speyer\u2014in 1914. Citro\u00ebn was a munitions supplier during WWI and later credited with reorganizing the postal service of the French Army and making other logistical improvements. \nHe founded <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> in 1919, which became known for producing mass-market cars with innovative features such as front-wheel drive and hydraulic suspension. In Africa, <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> established a presence in several countries, including Egypt, where the company not only manufactured vehicles but also participated in the local economy through investments in industries like agriculture and transportation. \nThe same year, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Andr\u00e9 Meyer convinced at Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn to spin-off <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier Industriel</italic> (\u201cSOVAC\u201d), a consumer finance company. SOVAC had several subsidiaries in Africa and had stakes in various financial institutions. <italic>Lazard</italic> became <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic>\u2019s major shareholder and Andr\u00e9 Meyer convinced the company to sell SOVAC to <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and <italic>Commercial Investment Trust</italic>. \nThis deal helped relieve <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> of the burden of funding and operating a bank and allowed Meyer to turn SOVAC into a broader-based finance company. As <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris facilitated the entry of <italic>Kreuger</italic> into France that year, all three <italic>Lazard</italic> houses joined <italic>Kreuger</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Vernes</italic>, and <italic>Shell</italic> to establish the Quebec-based <italic>French & Foreign Investing </italic>IHC. Citro\u00ebn\u2019s cousin\u2014a descendant of the Katz Chief Rabbi of Vienna Jacob Horowitz\u2014had married Jacob Hilsum, who served as a director of the Soviet <italic>Narodny </italic>Paris from 1927.\nBy 1928, France\u2019s third-largest car manufacturer, <italic>Peugeot,</italic> grew with her second-tier regional bank, <italic>Oustric</italic>. With BDF discounts, <italic>Oustric</italic> diversified cash flows as a BHC. <italic>Renault</italic> turned to<italic> Lehideux</italic>. Since serving with his brothers Jacques Lehideux worked at private bank <italic>Lehideux</italic>, Roger served on the boards of <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, and <italic>Nationale</italic> from 1920. By 1929, Jacques\u2019 son Fran\u00e7ois married the niece of engineer and automobile manufacturer Louis Renault. From 1934, Fran\u00e7ois became President of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Avions Caudron</italic> and General Director of <italic>Renault</italic>, later becoming Manager of <italic>Renault Aviation</italic> and director of <italic>Renault Aviation</italic> <italic>Motor</italic>. \nUnlike the unified Christian enterprises, France\u2019s Jewish aviation pioneer was Marcel Allatini Bloch. Born in Paris, he was related through his father to the Goudchaux, Halphen, and Orchel families, and through his mother to the Morpurgo and Lumbroso families before adopting the surname Dassault. During WWI, he developed a variable-pitch propeller, which he built into the foundation of <italic>Bloch-Dassault Aviation</italic> in the 1930s.\nAs FRS <italic>New York</italic> promoted acceptances, international French banks financed trade. Without London\u2019s system of discount and acceptance houses and bill broker, Parisian banks had created money market for government defense bills. While the large banks were reluctant to deal with long-term CP that BDF did not rediscountable, the merchant banks preferred long-term financing to discounting CP, and only two banks, <italic>Transatlantique</italic> and <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise et Italienne</italic> were specialized in negotiations with foreign countries. \nAlthough France founded the state-controlled <italic>French National Bank for Foreign Trade</italic> in 1920, industrial groups and banks hesitated to fund her. In 1928, with Bruno Schr\u00f6der\u2019s advice, BDF helped found <italic>Paris </italic><italic>Discount</italic> and, including the select merchant (<italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Indochine</italic>) and deposit banks (<italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Nationale</italic>), the <italic>French Acceptance Bank </italic>at the end of 1929. Soon, <italic>Schneider</italic> set up discounting houses for the Africa trade. \nSince David Weill named his son Pierre and Andr\u00e9 Meyer partners of <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in 1927, Raymond Philippe resigned as Head of <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in July 1929, possibly due to a failed speculation on the <italic>franc</italic>\u2019s rise or pressure from Meyer, and later founded one of Europe's first diversified investment funds. Hired to replace Philippe alongside George Wormser was Jean Bloch-Lain\u00e9. Born in Paris, Bloch was a converted grandnephew of socialist politician L\u00e9on Blum, a fifth great nephew of Cerf Berr, and a fourth great grandson of Olry Worms. \nAfter earning a law degree, he became an Inspector of Finance, and married the Christian Georgette Lain\u00e9, hyphenating her surname with his. He was named Knight of the Legion of Honor in 1919 for his management of issuing French war loans in New York through London. From 1920, he served as General Director of <italic>French Co for North America</italic> until he became General Director of <italic>Transatlantique </italic>and<italic> </italic>a partner from <italic>French National Bank for Foreign Trade </italic>in 1924. \nBy then, <italic>Transatlantique</italic>\u2019s delegated Administrator was Wladimir Archawski. After working at <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> in New York and Paris from 1920 to 1925, he became General Inspector at <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 <italic>Chinoise</italic>, appointed Deputy General Director in 1926. Around then courts appointed <italic>Chinoise </italic>as receiver for <italic>Banque Russo-Asiatique</italic><italic> </italic>from <italic>Marchal</italic>, whose in-laws were P\u00e9rier and Boissevain cousins. In 1928, Alfred Massenet became Vice Chair of <italic>Chinoise</italic> and wed  a noble, whose family had owned estates around Odessa. Born in Toulouse, Massenet was a nephew of Artur Levinsohn Rafalovich\u2019s cousin once removed-in-law. He worked at <italic>Lyonnais</italic> to 1902, and then launched Caucasus copper mining and enterprises in Morocco, America, and Brazil.\nLikewise, Massenet\u2019s cousin, Jose Massenet Aries, joined <italic>Renaud</italic>,<italic> </italic><italic>Marchal</italic>\u2019s industrial bank of Nancy. By 1927, Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Paul Dormann joined Massenet\u2019s ventures as a director. Since investing in Romanian oil and <italic>Bank of Mines</italic> in Bucharest, Dormann became a <italic>Chinoise</italic> director. They worked with Serge Rubinshtein, whose father Dmitri\u2014of no known relation to the Polyakov in-law Rubinsteins\u2014had banked the Tsar as President of <italic>Saint-Petersburg Private Commercial Bank</italic>.\nAlong with founding <italic>French Acceptance Bank </italic>in 1929, <italic>Nationale</italic> soon had over 750 branches. Since <italic>Comptoir de Mulhouse</italic>\u2019s French branches formed <italic>Nationale</italic> starting in 1913, <italic>Nationale</italic> grew into France\u2019s fourth largest deposit bank as <italic>Comptoir de Mulhouse</italic> returned to French control after WWI. With this growth, she added directors like Pierre Richemond, from the metallurgy industry had a network of industrialists, and Andr\u00e9 Vincent, of <italic>Forges et Aci\u00e9ries </italic>in Firminy and <italic>Comptoir Lyon-Alemand</italic>, and affiliated with <italic>Demachy Seilli\u00e8re</italic>. Since joining in 1919, Vincent became Chair in 1927. Branching to London in 1928, <italic>Nationale</italic> supported <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Commerciale de l\u2019Ouest Africain</italic> for trade between French-speaking and English-speaking Africa. By 1930, <italic>Nationale</italic> absorbed <italic>Comptoir de Mulhouse</italic> to manage her eastern French operations.\nMeanwhile, Jews dominated Austro-German automotives. During Germany\u2019s inflationary crisis, Jakob Schapiro, a Jewish coachmaker from Odessa, gained 60% of <italic>Benz</italic> shares and 25% of <italic>Daimler</italic> shares by 1924, becoming a major stakeholder in both companies. Buying<italic> W\u00fcrttembergische Vereinsbank</italic>, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> facilitated cooperation between <italic>Daimler</italic> and <italic>Benz</italic>. By 1926, <italic>Daimler</italic> and <italic>Benz</italic> merged, reducing Schapiro\u2019s stake to 16% and forcing him from the board. Resigning from <italic>Daimler</italic> <italic>Benz</italic>, Christian Ferdinand Porsche established his own motor firm, partnering with wealthy Jew Adolf Rosenberger to form <italic>Porsche</italic> <italic>Rosenberger</italic>. From 1928, <italic>Danat </italic>hoped to bring <italic>Daimler Benz</italic>, BMW, and <italic>Opel</italic> into a German automobile trust. Seeing<italic> Danat</italic> as competition, <italic>Deutsche</italic> sought to merge <italic>Daimler Benz </italic>with <italic>Opel</italic>. \nIn 1929, BOE and GRB increased interest rates to keep gold in their countries. As <italic>Morgan </italic>and GE organized the <italic>Young Plan</italic> to ease the burden of reparations payments on Germany, Andr\u00e9 Meyer of <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris represented French bankers in <italic>Bank for International Settlements</italic> (\u201cBIS\u201d). Meyer soon befriended <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s Eberstadt, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>\u2019s Mannheimer, and <italic>Danat</italic>\u2019s Jakob Goldsmith as they created inter-national fund movement. \nAs <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic> Frankfurt, and <italic>Beer</italic> shuttered around 1928, <italic>Deutsche </italic>considered merging with <italic>Danat</italic>, but fused with <italic>Disconto</italic> (including the former <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt) in 1929 instead. <italic>Deutsche</italic> also bought <italic>Rheinische Credit</italic>, solidifying her ownership of <italic>Daimler Benz</italic>. However, the Opel family sold <italic>Opel</italic> to American <italic>General Motor</italic> in May 1929. Goldsmith also worked with <italic>Kuhn</italic>. Like, WWI split German <italic>Bosch</italic>\u2019s American subsidiary. After the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic>, <italic>Danat</italic> and <italic>Kuhn</italic> bought <italic>Bosch</italic> America shares in hope of reuniting the two. Following the merger of <italic>Deutsche</italic> and <italic>Disconto</italic>, Christian Robert Croon Pferdmenges joined <italic>Oppenheim</italic>. \nAs BDF by eased inter-bank clearing to stimulate MMMOF in July, MOF reduced foreign securities taxes. But <italic>Young </italic>pushed austerity on GRS to support the gold standard and reparations. Growing coal unemployment payouts shrank GRS, city, and manor solvency. After taxing matchsticks at 60% in 1918, GRS leased the matchstick monopoly to <italic>Kreuger</italic>, which secured the deal with forged collateral. As state appointed commissioners forced municipal budgets, GRB refused to discount city debt and GRS limited city access to foreign capital per <italic>Young</italic>. So, Berlin depended on <italic>Danat</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Hallgarten</italic>. As New York banks demanded cities secure loans with PUs, <italic>Dillon</italic> helped GE bought stakes in GGE and <italic>Siemens</italic> per <italic>Young</italic>. \nDespite the Depression slowing Italian PUHCs, the country celebrated two royal marriages. In January 1930, Crown Prince Humbert of Italy wed Princess Marie Jose of Belgium. As Duke Emanuele Filiberto of Aosta arranged a meeting between King Boris III of Bulgaria and Princess Giovanna. Duchess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne of Aosta proposed the match to King Victor Emmanuel III, leading to negotiations between Bulgarian Premier Andrey Liaptcheff and Italian Premier Mussolini for the wedding that year.\nDuring Britain\u2019s economic crisis, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand urged BOE to investigate gold normalization as a potential solution. In 1930, Parliament commissioned the <italic>Macmillan Report</italic> to identify the causes of the crisis and propose policies to restore economic stability. While guiding the committee\u2019s efforts, Brand believed that resuming lending from America and France would help address the crisis, Kindersley advocated for increased cooperation among central bankers from gold standard countries to establish an international credit bank. America and France declined to cooperate, but Japan adopted a deflationary policy and restored the gold standard, which increased unemployment and the decrease in prices affected the farming population.<italic> </italic>\nOver this time, Continental banking consolidated. Back in 1928 in Bulgaria, <italic>Mortgage Bank</italic> started with partial state-ownership and foreign capital from <italic>Blair</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, and <italic>Parisienne</italic>, SG <italic>Belge</italic>\u2019s affiliate, and lesser participation from UBS in Zurich, <italic>Amsterdam Bank</italic>, and others. By 1929, <italic>Franco-Belgian</italic> merged with <italic>Balkanique</italic> to form <italic>Franco-Belgian</italic> & <italic>Balkanique</italic>. And the merger of <italic>Deutsche</italic> and <italic>Disconto</italic> that year led their affiliates, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> Sofia and<italic> Banque de Cr\u00e9dit</italic>, to combine. After losses in the tobacco trade, <italic>Franco-Bulgare</italic> merged with <italic>Bulgarian Bank</italic> and smaller institutions in 1930 to create <italic>Union des Banques Bulgares</italic>. Likewise, in Czechoslovakia, with local government support, <italic>Anglo-Czechoslovak</italic><italic> </italic>acquired <italic>Mercur</italic>-affiliated <italic>Prague</italic> <italic>Commercial Bank</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>-affiliated <italic>Prague Credit Bank</italic>, providing a counterbalance to <italic>Zivnostenska Bank</italic>.\nMeanwhile, as Germany\u2019s Junker President replaced the socialist chancellor with centrist Br\u00fcning, Junkers and anti-capitalists gave Hitler\u2019s <italic>National Socialists </italic>(\u201cNazis\u201d) 18% of seats. With investors running, GRS abolished capital yield taxes, capped city budgets, and taxed bonds. She soon revoked the latter. From June 1930, GRS allowed the <italic>Minster of Economics</italic> to unilaterally declare cartel price maintenance null and void. Since reorganizing <italic>Saxon Light & Power</italic> in 1901, <italic>Arnhold</italic> sold her to GGE, and joined the Board of the latter. \nAfter America\u2019s <italic>Smoot-Hawley </italic>tariff, France repatriated gold from London in 1930. That year, to enhance the market for acceptances in Paris, MOF reduced the stamp duties on bills issued by foreign countries and payable in France from 0.15 to 0.025%. This reduction put Paris ahead of London, where the stamp duty was 0.20%, but still posed a disadvantage compared to New York where there was no charge. Without ECGD like Britain and Germany, French trade bills did not have state-guarantees. While Britain ignored the growth of leasing bills in the 1920s, BOE began discounting them by March 1930<italic>.</italic>\nSince WWI, French provincial banks were divided into three groups connected to Parisian banks through interlocked directorates: the central and southern group of <italic>Banque Priv\u00e9e Lyonnaise</italic> and <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic>; the northern group of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Nord</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Nord</italic>, and <italic>Adam</italic>; and the eastern group of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nanc\u00e9ienne de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> and <italic>Renaud</italic>. In 1930, the banking system faced crises. On October 17, concerns emerged about Albert Oustric\u2019s <italic>Oustric </italic>group, affiliated with <italic>Peugeot</italic>, and his capital-raising methods. \nRevelations that <italic>Oustric</italic>\u2019s companies had mutual financial supported one another led<italic> Paris Stock Exchange</italic> to suspend trading of <italic>Oustric </italic>stocks on October 30. In November, <italic>Adam</italic> failed, triggering a banking panic. Withdrawals spread to other provincial banks including <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Rh\u00f4ne, Banque du Dauphin\u00e9, Cr\u00e9dit du Nord, Banque R\u00e9gionale de l\u2019Ouest </italic>in Blois<italic>, Banque Courtois </italic>in Toulouse<italic>, </italic>and<italic> Banque de Strasbourg</italic>, with deposits increasing in public MSBs. As BDF discounted <italic>Oustric</italic>\u2019s paper as a bailout, the resulting scandal led to the downfall of PM Andr\u00e9 Tardieu and the ascent of Pierre Laval\u2019s deflationary government.\nDepositors ran from colonial banks, which struggled due to a slump in oil and other raw material prices. <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019Afrique</italic> nearly suspended payments as her until receiving support from <italic>Marchal</italic>,<italic> Nationale</italic>, and a collateralized facility from <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic>, while <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> and <italic>Transatlantique </italic>faced runs but coped as the French Ministry aided colonial banks. Also in late 1930, <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df </italic>took over<italic> Adam</italic>.\nWithin a few months, conditions deteriorated for <italic>Marchal</italic>, with interests in <italic>Banque d\u2019Alsace et de Lorraine</italic>, <italic>Priv\u00e9e</italic>, <italic>Renauld</italic>, and <italic>l\u2019Afrique</italic>. After receiving support from the Ministry, <italic>Marchal</italic> and <italic>Nationale</italic> liquidated in late 1931. Along with divesting from <italic>Renaud</italic>, <italic>Marchal</italic> transferred <italic>Banque d\u2019Alsace et de Lorraine</italic> to <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic>-aligned<italic> Industriel</italic>, which also absorbed <italic>Privee </italic>with <italic>Nationale</italic>\u2019s interests. \nWithout <italic>Marchal</italic> and <italic>Nationale</italic> their affiliated sub-Saharan Africa <italic>l\u2019Afrique</italic> and <italic>Banque Commerciale Africaine</italic>, suspended payments. As the Ministry allowed <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic><italic> </italic>to issue banknotes to rescue <italic>Africaine</italic> and facilitated recapitalization by <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Transatlantique</italic>. <italic>Africaine</italic><italic> </italic>then joined <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Chinoise</italic>, <italic>Industriel</italic>, <italic>Transatlantique</italic>, and <italic>Parisienne</italic> in reconstructing <italic>l\u2019Afrique</italic> under Ministry pressure and to counter the threat of <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>\u2019 <italic>Banque Belge d\u2019Afrique</italic>.\nAlong with depressed commodity prices, political unrest reinforced bank failures. Following the 1930 coup that ousted Peruvian President Augusto Legu\u00eda\u2014an ally of the agro-export elite\u2014state support for the large, internationally funded <italic>London Bank of Peru </italic>effectively vanished. A run on the bank soon followed, and by early 1931, it had collapsed into bankruptcy.\nAlso in 1930, without board approval, Horace Finaly replaced <italic>Paribas\u2019</italic> President of 15 years with \u00c9mile Moreau, who had been Governor of BDF since 1926. While <italic>Paribas</italic> had poor relationships with <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in the 1920s, they improved from 1930\u2014possibly because of Andr\u00e9 Meyer\u2014and the two banks soon and <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam soon began closely collaborating. By then, Wladimir Archawski, a Deputy General Director of <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 <italic>Chinoise </italic>and Board Director of <italic>Transatlantique</italic>, married Antoinette Lazard Fould, whose father had founded <italic>Transatlantique</italic>. \nMoreover, <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic>\u2019s situation became critical. Meyer recommended restructuring the company, but Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn declined, leading <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris to move away from <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> from December 1930. After refusing to support <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Industrielle des T\u00e9l\u00e9phones</italic> and deciding to save <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic>, Christian Lazard left <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, retreating to the family farm.\nAfter banishing his main rival, the secular Jew Leon Trotsky, in 1927, Stalin arrested and deported Jewish clergymen on trumped up \u2018Trotskyite\u2019 charges. Like Lenin\u2019s <italic>de-Cossackization </italic>of 1920, Stalin\u2019s<italic> dekulakization</italic> meant to exterminate conservatives, deported almost two million urbanites from Moscow and Saint-Petersburg (renamed to Leningrad by then) to Siberia from 1930. Although Spanish banks financed coal in the provinces, they monopolized oil and suspended Soviet purchases from 1930. While the political right represented mine and landowners, deflation pushed steel unions and landless farmers to socialism. \nTo eliminate speculation, panics, and unemployment, Stalin\u2019s credit reforms banned inter-company credit, forcing transactions to settle via <italic>Bank of Soviet Union</italic> (\u201cBSU\u201d) from 1930. State budgets funded enterprise without debt. As BSU furnished free capital, Stalin expropriated private and foreign business. Closing trade with the west and acquiring imported resources through government intervention. (He paid in gold notes to Americans like Armand Hammer.) While Stalin sent grain to Ukraine during drought in 1931, he pushed Russification of institutions and enterprises, particularly on industrial Ukraine. Quashing Ukrainian protest, Stalin seized Ukrainian crops to manufacture mass famine by 1933. \nInvolved in this operation was Lazar Kaganovich, the highest-ranking individual of Jewish heritage in the Soviet Union. Born outside of Kiew, joined the Bolshevik Party in 1911, and became a member of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee in 1918. After joining the Politburo in 1930, he directed the reconstruction of Moscow and oversaw the start of the Moscow Metro. As his brother became the Deputy People\u2019s Commissar of Heavy Industry, he led the Central Committee\u2019s Agriculture Department and enforced collectivization from 1933. In 1935, he was appointed Commissar of Railways. \nKaganovich\u2019s possible relative, Nicolas Kagan rose up at<italic> Seligman</italic> Paris, which soon became the Soviet Union\u2019s banker in France. Kagan\u2019s sister married into the Soviet fur trader <italic>Eitingon</italic> family of New York and Poland. However, other Russo-French banks, like <italic>Saint-Petersburg International Commercial Bank</italic>\u2019s former Paris branch, failed.\nAnd as coal deflated, French Indochinese coal firms consolidated. Amidst the deflation since 1929, Vietnamese and European protestors blamed <italic>Indochine</italic> for their misfortunes, turning to Communism while looting government offices, burning tax records, and murdering officials. Octave Homberg\u2019s <italic>French & Colonial </italic>HC faced financial difficulties by the end of 1930, prompting <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Indochine</italic>, and <italic>Parisienne</italic> to intervene, ensuring its stability and safeguarding French colonial interests. In cooperation with <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and <italic>Indochine</italic>, <italic>Worms </italic>took over <italic>French Co of Dredging & Public Works</italic> and importation of Indochinese coal into France grew. \nBy 1932, Hypolite Worms became President of their JV with <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Real Estate Union</italic>. <italic>Worms </italic>took over <italic>French & Colonial</italic>\u2019s colonial enterprises, and expanded shipping, venturing into long-haul shipping, banking services, the creation of French national carrier, <italic>Air France</italic>, and oceangoing petroleum transportation.\nLikewise, <italic>Worsmer</italic> kinterlinked with <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris through the Christian sons of Edmond Meynial, a law professor in Paris. Since both earned law degrees, Pierre joined <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris in 1926 and Raymond entering <italic>Worms</italic> in 1933. When the former Governor of Indochina, Albert Sarraut, served briefly as PM in 1933, his daughter married <italic>Indochine</italic> banker Jean Sainteny, and his niece married <italic>Seligman</italic> Paris\u2019 Nicolas Kagan. In 1931, <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris added as a partner Frenchman Maurice Didion, a descendant of  a <italic>Talbot</italic> affiliate from the 19th century, who soon became a director of BGGE.\nIn Indonesia, the Dutch<italic> </italic>joined British cartels against deflation but remained on gold to pacify Japan. Similarly, in French labor cartelized. While <italic>Lyonnais</italic> and other banks encouraged Chinese middlemen into Madagascar and Reunion through the 1920s, a government decree required immigrants to prove ownership of a commercial venture, possess a certain amount of money, or have a job contract in 1929. Reunion imposed additional restrictions on Chinese immigration, and by 1932, added administrative measures, such as identity cards and deposit requirements. Asians, including Chinese, were also restricted from certain professions. \nAfter the Chinese diaspora across Southeast Asia made their fortunes in the rice, rubber, shipping, and import-export industries, they diversified into trade banking. While Southeast Asian Chinese families banked trade, they fused amidst deflation, the largest being <italic>Oversea Chinese Banking Corp </italic>(\u201cOCBC\u201d). Across rubber and tin investments in Malaya and Southeast Asia, Indian Chettiars suffered with the onset of the depression in 1929 as it immobilized their liquid capital by converting it into immovable property and checked the continuous flow of credit, which was very essential for the harmonious working of their system. \nThe failure of the small firms was infectious, and some medium and a few large firms also collapsed during this period. The government introduced measures to check the problem of the alienation of land from peasant proprietors to non-agriculturists, which exacerbated the problem. While Chinese Malaya rubber trader Tan Kah Kee transferred his properties to creditor directors, he remained manager. In Thailand, the government promulgated the country\u2019s first banking act in 1930, Chinese rice exporters established commercial banks and insurers, mainly to finance their own businesses, until the Chens founded the large <italic>Bank of Bangkok</italic> in 1944. \nAsia also received financing from Africa. Ascending Ethiopia\u2019s throne in 1930, Haile Selassie engaged in several business ventures, including ownership of a fruit plantation and shares in a road construction firm. In 1931, the Ethiopian government took control of <italic>Bank of Abyssinia</italic>, rebranding her as <italic>Bank of Ethiopia</italic>. This transition aimed to bolster economic autonomy and expand trade relationships, including those with lesser-known producers like the Philippines. Likewise, Ethiopia signed a friendship and commerce treaty with Japan, and, in 1931, an Ethiopian delegation traveled to Japan to strengthen diplomatic ties, including Selassie\u2019s cousin Araya Abeba. While Abeba later attempted to marry the daughter of Viscount Kuroda Hiroyuki of Japan\u2019s Imperial Household Forestry Bureau, Ethiopian and Japanese authorities blocked the marriage due to political and cultural concerns.\nSince Europe attempts in the 1890s, WWI and Civil War retarded Chinese railroads and industry. While China joined <italic>League of Nations</italic> to industrialize under Chiang, Japan invaded in late 1931. As fighting reached Shanghai, depositors ran from banks. Li Ming formed the <italic>Joint Reserve Board</italic> of <italic>Chinese Bankers Association</italic> to conserve liquidity with clearinghouse certificates to end runs. He also organized <italic>National Industrial </italic>in 1932, becoming Chair of Hangchow\u2019s PU. Li raised funds to extend <italic>Shanghai Power </italic>with HSBC. \nBy 1931, after destabilizing Hatry\u2019s steel IHC, BOE formed <italic>Bankers\u2019 Industrial Dev </italic>HC with Grenfell-cousin <italic>Benson</italic> for <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> to take over <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> Britain operated by <italic>Rothschild</italic>-cousin <italic>Merton</italic> while forcing steel, coal, and cotton consolidation as oil deflated coal and shipping. As German manufactures opposed quotas, Germany withdrew from the <italic>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</italic>-led supra-national steel cartel, and it collapsed by March. That month, John Rockefeller, associated with <italic>Chatham Phenix </italic>NB<italic> & Trust</italic>, married a daughter of <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>\u2019s Central Europe representative Alex Watjen.\nMeanwhile, the <italic>Young Plan</italic> continued to choke German credit. While Br\u00fcning prevented foreign industrial control by halting Bremen\u2019s sales of water and electricity PUs to a BGGE\u2019s syndicate in January 1931, the German Finance Ministry warned against French imperialism as industrialist Louis Marlio expressed interest in Rhenish municipal PUs. As GRS aided Junkers in March, she taxed industry capital. The same month, as GRB refused to discount city debt and <italic>Damat</italic>\u2019s credit ran low, Berlin sold PUs to BGGE\u2019s syndicate. By May, GRB failed to sell bonds. \nWithout a customs union, GGE abandoned Austria\u2019s hydroelectricity. Since Germany and Austria sought a customs union against <italic>Versailles</italic>, France tied debt aid to dropping the union. While BIS and France continued to tying debt aid to dropping the union, <italic>Rothschild </italic>Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> failed on May 11. Since the crisis stalled German budget negotiations, creditors ran from banks. As GRB hiked rates, Br\u00fcning secured a Presidential<italic> </italic>emergency decree (<italic>noteverordung</italic>) to tax income and cap city taxes, replace resistant city officials with commissioners<italic>.</italic> \nWhile <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Kindersley joined <italic>Chase</italic> NB and law firm <italic>Freshfield</italic> in negotiations on behalf of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s international creditors, <italic>Auspitz</italic> <italic>Lieben </italic>became insolvent. One partner was found dead, and another, Stefan Porges Auspitz, a <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> director, attempted suicide but was rescued. Auspitz later liquidated his fortune to pay debts. As <italic>Danat</italic> and other banks bought their own deflating shares to avoid triggering automatic bankruptcy, <italic>Arnhold</italic> fused with <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> in June.\nWhile <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> merged with <italic>Wiener Bank</italic> and consolidated domestic banking power, Austrian influence in Poland and other former colonies fell. As <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> was the main foreign creditor for Romania\u2019s main bank, <italic>Marmorosch </italic>of Bucharest<italic> </italic>to fail. With help refused by the bank\u2019s state-connected smaller rival, <italic>Banca </italic><italic>Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103</italic>, <italic>Romanian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>intervened to support<italic> Marmorosch </italic>in a receiver-like capacity to pay off creditors. \nDespite the avoidance of severe damage to the economy and the fact that, except for Aristide Blanco, Christians directed the Board since its conversion into a limited company after the <italic>Panic of 1899</italic>, the loss of the bank was a serious blow to private trust and state support for Jewish institutions. The proposal of the Austro-German customs union worsened economic instability and Romanian banks faced severe deposit runs by autumn 1931, resulting in the closure of <italic>Bank Berkowitz</italic>, <italic>Romanian General</italic>, <italic>Bank Moldova</italic>, and nearly <italic>Commercial Bank of Romania</italic>.\nAfter <italic>Lazard </italic>London\u2019s Brand and economist John Keynes spent months planning as part of <italic>Macmillan Commission</italic>, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> collapse mooted much of their work. By July 1931, <italic>Macmillan </italic><italic>Commission</italic> concluded that short-term <italic>pound</italic> liabilities exceeded assets and endorsed devaluation and tariffs. That day, without discountable assets, <italic>Danat</italic> allowed <italic>Nordwolle</italic> to fail. Led by the Lutheran Lahusen family of Bremen for five decades to become Europe\u2019s largest textile before falsifying the balance sheet. GRS suspended the <italic>Boerse</italic> to shutter <italic>Danat</italic>. Despite Hoover\u2019s moratorium to rollover GRS debts, GRB lowered banks\u2019 currency coverage ratios as investors withdrew FX. To protect the <italic>mark</italic>, GRB raised her discount rate from 7 to 10% and the rate on collateral loans grew from 8 to 15%. \nDue to ties with <italic>Danat</italic>, <italic>Mercur Bank</italic> temporarily closed in Vienna. As FRS and BOE floated a large loan to <italic>Austrian National Bank</italic>, GRS agreed on a budget, and Marxist riots stopped with bank runs. While <italic>Bank of Lithuania</italic> intervened to stabilize <italic>Commercial Bank of </italic><italic>Kowno</italic>, <italic>Bank of Latvia</italic>, led by Adolfs Klive\u2014a co-founder of the Agrarian Union political party and aligned with the failed<italic> </italic>Christian nationalist  <italic>Farmers Union</italic>, <italic>Farmers Bank</italic>, and <italic>Union Bank</italic>\u2014withheld support from the Jewish <italic>Bank of Libau</italic> and <italic>International Bank of Riga</italic>, which suspended. Likewise, Estonia promoted industrialization, with <italic>Lee</italic> <italic>Higginson</italic>\u2019s Thomas McKittrick later joining <italic>Northern Paper & Pulp Works</italic>\u2019 board.\nSince 1927, <italic>Women</italic>\u2019s<italic> International Zionist Organization</italic> established a people\u2019s kitchen in the Jewish Metropolis of Warsaw and founded a credit bank for artisans and retailers. From then, Poland faced severe economic upheaval, marked by a contraction in foreign credit, declining industrial output, and plummeting agricultural prices. \nAs Jewish banks focused on short-term credit, most collapsed, and brought down Jewish cooperative banks. Despite government attempts to intervene with a debt moratorium in 1932, the crisis persisted due to Poland\u2019s reliance on foreign capital and limited internal market. These challenges disproportionately affected the Jewish population, particularly shopkeepers who extended credit to farmers, exacerbating their economic plight. Discriminatory tax policies and enforcement practices further compounded the difficulties faced by Polish Jews during this period.\nWhile <italic>Deutsch Bank</italic> showed little concern over seeing a rival disappear, foreign creditors ran from Germany, and <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand urged Kindersley to persuade British bankers to agree not to withdraw funds from Germany. A large creditor of<italic> Creditanstalt</italic> and <italic>Danat</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London was in trouble. By July 1931, the suicide of a trader at <italic>Lazard</italic> Brussels exposed a hidden \u00a34 million loss caused by shorting the <italic>franc</italic>. \nA rouge FX trader later struck <italic>Lazard</italic> Madrid. To mitigate the damage, BOE loaned \u00a33 million to <italic>Lazard</italic> London as collateral. Kindersley and other minority shareholders gave up their shares for nothing. While <italic>Exchequer</italic> agreed to reimburse <italic>Lazard</italic> London for taxes paid for the previous four years, BOE forced the closure of the Brussels, Antwerp, and Madrid offices. As <italic>Pearson</italic> became sole owner of <italic>Lazard</italic> London, the Weills, Andr\u00e9 Meyer, and Lazard heiresses repaid the loan over seven years as they bought equity back from <italic>Pearson</italic>. \nOn August 11, 1931, GRB reduced its discount rate and rate on collateral loans, restoring them to the levels that existed on July 31. Germany\u2019s President then issued a <italic>noteverordung</italic> to authorize state cabinets to decree all measures necessary to balance state budgets of the states. Amidst of corporate failures, another <italic>noteverordung</italic> prescribed record-keeping, independent audits, and publicity for company reports, as well as defining the duties of managers and directors. After GRS gave GRB an FX monopoly and froze foreign deposits, <italic>Boerse</italic> reopened for cash dealings with short sale restrictions on September 3rd, without margin loan settlement for two weeks. \nSince early July, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand asked Kindersley to persuade British banks to jointly agree not to withdraw gold from Germany. As <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> dominated Anglo-German acceptances and <italic>Chase</italic> NB was the leading American bank lender to Germany, Henry Tiarks and Albert Wiggin led the committee of international bankers who agreed to the<italic> Standstill Agreement </italic>by September 19th, postponing Germany\u2019s reparation payments and extending acceptance payment terms. \nWhile Gates McGarrah resigned from <italic>Chase</italic> to lead BIS, his successor John McHugh led <italic>Chase</italic> and McHugh\u2019s son-in-law Charles Beal served as Treasure of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic><italic> </italic>New York. Afterward, BIS\u2019 all-Christian German Credits Arbitration Committee included Marcus Wallenberg of <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>, Thomas McKittrick of <italic>Lee Higginson </italic>London, Franz Urbig of <italic>Deutsche Disconto</italic>, and, from 1932, Wallenberg\u2019s cousin-in-law Carl Trygger of <italic>Gothenburg Enskilda</italic>, Granville Tyser of<italic> Lazard</italic> London, and Robert Pferdmenges of <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne.\nWhile Pferdmenges advised the German <italic>Standstill</italic> Committee and provided counsel to Chancellor Br\u00fcning mostly behind the scenes, Managing Director of <italic>Berliner</italic> Otto Jeidel headed the German <italic>Standstill</italic> Committee. Jeidel\u2019s great-grandfather, Moses, was born in W\u00fcrzburg, whose children kinterlinked with <italic>Ellissen</italic>, <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, and <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel. Another son of Moses became a banker, and his son married Anna Speyer Niederhofheim, the niece of Jacob Schiff\u2019s mother and a Bondi cousin. \nFrom this union, Otto Jeidels studied law at <italic>Uni of Bonn</italic> before attending <italic>Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t</italic> in Berlin and <italic>Cologne</italic> Business, graduating with a doctorate focused on political science, economics, and law in 1904. In 1907, he started at <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> and then joined <italic>Berliner</italic> in 1909, initially serving as head of the administrative staff. He became a Partner in 1918, converting to Protestantism, and gaining prominence over the F\u00fcrstenbergs. In 1927, he rejected <italic>Nordwolle</italic>\u2019s request for additional credit, which turned to <italic>Danat</italic> instead. \nWith the freeze creating a liquidity strain for London merchant banks that had guaranteed German merchant commercial bills\u2014mainly <italic>Kleinwort</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Huth</italic>, <italic>Japhet</italic>, <italic>G\u00f6schen Cunliffe</italic>, and <italic>Arbuthnot Latham</italic>\u2014which had to liquidate their securities to meet their unexpected liabilities. The crisis collapsed trade liquidity by reducing new acceptances granted. Severely curtailing the business, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> would not recover her funds until the early 1950s. As he represented the British banks at GRB in Berlin with<italic> Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s Tiarks relinquished control of <italic>Schr\u00f6der </italic>to Bruno Schr\u00f6der. While Paris\u2019 acceptance market would not return for years, America\u2019s <italic>Commodity Credit Corp</italic> further pushed out private investment. \nThe end of the acceptance market ended in Amsterdam caused mostly Jewish private banks <italic>Teixeira</italic>, <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>, <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic> <italic>Amsterdamse Crediet</italic>, and <italic>Rhodius</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Koenigs</italic> to record heavy losses, while <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam postponed problems and Christian commercial banks regained ground. Although <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>\u2019s Paul May became commissioner of <italic>Nederlandsche Bank</italic> in 1932, his appointment was criticized as \u201cjudenfreundlich,\u201d and the board of commissioners had to find a new meeting place because the Groote Club excluded Jews. \nAs German creditors repatriated gold from London, Parliament sought to increase taxes on September 11, 1931. But as the Chilean nitrates industry, including a <italic>Guggenheim</italic> venture, collapsed, BOE rescued <italic>Anglo-</italic><italic>South American Bank</italic> on the 15th. BOE led a reorg and imposed a new and trusted chair to save the bank. Without a deal with BDF or a resolution on taxes, Parliament\u2019s ruling coalition splintered. \nOn September 20th, BOE suspended gold convertibility, which prompted other countries to follow suit or implement FX controls. Britain\u2019s new regime led to commodity cartels and tariffs. While stock exchanges closed in Belgium, Germany, and Japan, they stayed open in North America. The French, Belgian, Dutch, and Swiss gold bloc converted <italic>dollars</italic> into gold, pressuring America. In France, gold ran from <italic>Nationale</italic> and other private banks to public MSB. \n<italic>Anglo-International Bank</italic> became BOE Governor Montague Norman\u2019s Central European investment bank, operating BOE\u2019s FX account and taking up German government bond issues. Marquess of Reading Rufus Isaacs steered legislation on the suspension of the gold standard. Since co-founding the <italic>Anglo-German Association</italic> in 1929, he became widowed and, in August 1931, married a Christian born in Ottoman Turkey to British Huguenot manager of the tobacco monopoly. Later that month, he became the first Jewish Foreign Secretary, and, as the first Jewish leader of the House of Lords since PM Benjamin Disraeli. \nIn Germany, Br\u00fcning enacted a 10% <italic>noteverordung</italic> tax on foreign investors by 1931. When Europeans sold American stocks to repatriate gold, FRS hiked rates in October. That month, the great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Princess May, married Abel Smyth, bringing the merchant banking cartel closer with the highest level of aristocracy.\nA grandson of John Forbes and a son of AT&T\u2019s founding president, former <italic>Stone Webster</italic> executive Cameron Forbes progressively led the Philippines under Theodore Roosevelt to become Governor under Taft, and then Ambassador to Japan from 1930. As her high-labor coal-industry was already weak from competition with oil-fueled automobiles, Japan refocusing from competition to colonization from 1931. In September, Japan invaded China to extend railroads from Korea into Manchuria. \nAnd as Japan began allowing cartels to stabilize profits, she left the gold standard by December. So, Japanese BHCs stabilized coal, oil, and PUs, displacing Britain in global textile exports. By 1931, <italic>Swan</italic> branched to Tokyo, where they represented <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> of New York and <italic>Lazard</italic> London in PU financing. Since John Morgan Jr\u2019s cousin-in-law Joseph Grew negotiated through WWI, the diplomat served as Under Secretary of State and Ambassador to Turkey before replacing Forbes as Ambassador to Japan in 1932.\nAfter FRS hiked rates, more frauds unwound. Since<italic> Commerzbank</italic> merged with <italic>Mitteldeutsche Credit</italic> and fused their brewers <italic>Schulheiss-Patzenhofer</italic> and <italic>Ostwerke</italic>. While his cousin Albert Katz was Deputy Chair of <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, Ludwig Katz falsified the brewery\u2019s balance sheet, and <italic>Commerzbank</italic> and <italic>Danat</italic> directors signed the financial statements in March 1931. As the fraud came out in October, Curt Sobernheim\u2014son-in-law of <italic>Danat</italic>\u2019s Lando family\u2014and the Katz directors of <italic>Commerzbank</italic> resigned. While acquitting most board members, the court imprisoned balance sheet concealer Katz for three-month in 1932. Along with the brewery\u2019s losses Nazis exploited the scandal to highlight \u2018Jewish speculators.\u2019 \nSeveral months later, the head of <italic>Lahusen</italic> got five years in prison for falsifying balance sheets and violating the bankruptcy laws. Banks consolidated for survival. Since <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Berlin bought <italic>Akzept und Garantiebank</italic> in July 1931, Hugo Mendelssohn Bartholdy invested in <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Berlin, a decade after the death of its founder, in early 1932. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Kreuger</italic> sold Swedish <italic>Erickson</italic> to IT&T. After an audit, IT&T withdrew, and Ivar Kreuger turned to <italic>Skandinaviska Kredit</italic>. While possibly murdered in March 1932, his assumed suicide led Swedish receivers to fire sell assets, leaving little for the IHC. Kreuger\u2019s was the third largest IHC failure after those of Insull and Eaton. As Kreuger\u2019s enterprises were subject to bankruptcy in America, <italic>Kreuger</italic>\u2019s American creditors elected Jean Monnet\u2014who had supported <italic>Lee</italic>\u2019s George Murnane in introducing <italic>Kreuger</italic> to governments\u2014to liquidate. However, most assets remained in Sweden, where <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Hugh Kindersley helped negotiate. \nAs <italic>Skandinaviska Kredit </italic>lost control of his <italic>Kreuger</italic> enterprise, <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> and <italic>Svenska Handelsbanken </italic>split <italic>Ericsson</italic> and gained other assets, including uninterrupted interest payments from German and other sovereign debt backed by match monopolies. With the collapse of <italic>Kreuger</italic>,<italic> Lee </italic>wound down in America and France\u2014while continuing to operate in London\u2014and Murnane sought to join Monnet. Having all met during <italic>Versailles</italic> negotiations, Dulles recommended <italic>Sullivan </italic>fund <italic>Monnet Murnane </italic>in 1934.\nWhen Britain suspended gold convertibility in September 1931, the troubles of <italic>Comptoir Lyon-Alemand</italic> led <italic>Nationale</italic>\u2019s depositors to run from her, reducing her deposits from 2,112 to 977 million <italic>francs</italic> by December. Since Andr\u00e9 Vincent\u2014<italic>Nationale</italic>\u2019s Chair with large stake in <italic>Comptoir Lyon-Alemand</italic>\u2014defaulted in October, depositor runs forced <italic>Nationale</italic> to liquidate by yearend. Vincent\u2019s bankruptcy intensified the crisis. By early November 1931, nearly 230 provincial banks went bankrupt, including <italic>Widow Gu\u00e9rin</italic>, <italic>Ramel</italic>, <italic>Tardif</italic>, <italic>Charpenay</italic>, and <italic>Vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne</italic>. In February 1932, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> acquired <italic>Nationale</italic>\u2019s stakes in <italic>Banque d\u2019Alsace-Lorraine</italic>, <italic>Priv\u00e9e</italic>, <italic>Comptoir d\u2019Escompte de la Sarthe</italic>, and <italic>Banque de la Vall\u00e9e du Rh\u00f4ne</italic>. The panic spread to other banks, shuttering <italic>Comptoir</italic> <italic>de Reims</italic>, <italic>Syndicale de Paris</italic>, and <italic>Courvoisier</italic>.\nSince the financial crisis in Central Europe and losses on Hungarian investments forced two-thirds of <italic>Parisienne</italic>\u2019s deposits to run by 1931. One of <italic>Parisienne</italic>\u2019s investors, <italic>Demachy Seilli\u00e8re</italic> provided 25 million to support <italic>Parisienne</italic>. Seeking liquidity, <italic>Demachy</italic> obtained an overdraft of 28 to 30 million from her major shareholder, the Wendel family. After a run in May 1932, SG <italic>Belge</italic> led a syndicate to reorg <italic>Parisienne</italic>, which merged with France\u2019s third largest investment, bank <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>. \nSince early 1932, Pierre Weill married Berthe, daughter of Louise Samuel and Belgian banker Gaston Haardt, who helped industrialize Russia, Spain, and held <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> interests. After <italic>Nationale</italic>\u2019s depositors ran through February 1932, MOF guaranteed her deposits to prevent a panic. With the help of big banks, <italic>Nationale</italic> reorganized as a deposit bank in April. \nSince she was rescued out of liquidation by <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df </italic>in 1931, <italic>Adam</italic> and <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic> moved closer to the reorganized <italic>Nationale </italic>through <italic>Banque de Mulhouse</italic>\u2019s Lantz Dreyfu\u00df family and to <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris through the Rheims family. By 1933, <italic>Lazard </italic>Paris joined <italic>Rothschild </italic>Paris<italic> </italic>to bail out <italic>Parisienne</italic>. After Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Lazard Thibault married Hubert Chambure, a Christian son of a Count and representative of <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2014in 1931, Chambure\u2019s sister divorced and married a Rothschild in 1934.\nAs coalers cartelized\u2014ending a century of labor fueled economic growth combined with the spread of Socialist and Marxist thought fostered French laborer strikes\u2014France\u2019s largest cement maker <italic>Poliet Chausson</italic> was taken over by <italic>Lazard</italic> London, only to find greater losses. By May 1932, BOE extended a loan to <italic>Lazard</italic> London, which raised funds for <italic>English Electric</italic> and reorged Newcastle-upon-Tyne\u2019s PU. Moreover, around 22 provincial banks, including <italic>Centrale des Banques de Provinc</italic>, <italic>Renaud</italic> in Nancy,<italic> Charpentier </italic>in Cognac, and <italic>Centre</italic> in Limoges. Moreover, consolidation for survival continued. Since acquiring <italic>Priv\u00e9e</italic> in 1931, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> added <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nanc\u00e9ienne de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> in 1933. <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Nord</italic> absorbed <italic>Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Nord</italic> in May 1934. \nIn Germany, Br\u00fcning had tried to refloat <italic>Danat</italic>, but as <italic>Deutsche</italic> <italic>Disconto </italic>and <italic>Krupp </italic>refused because of antipathy for Jakob Goldsmith, <italic>Dresdner</italic> bought <italic>Danat</italic>\u2019s assets. While Germany received a BIS moratorium, the Nazis gained in districts where <italic>Danat</italic> failed. In the Spring of 1932, worsening economic conditions allowed the Nazi Party to make significant gains in the Austrian parliamentary elections. \nDespite losing important segments of its constituency to the Nazis, the <italic>Christian Social Party</italic> (\u201cCSP\u201d) continued to lead the government, and in May 1932, Engelbert Dollfuss formed a new cabinet to counter the rise of the Nazis. Dollfuss\u2019 coalition had a one-vote majority. As the Nazis pressed for new elections to gain more seats, Dollfuss refused, fearing defeat. Instead, he grew closer to the Italian Benito Mussolini. \nAmidst bank failures and the death of <italic>Pisa</italic>\u2019s Luigi Della Torre in 1930, <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic> and <italic>Credito Italiano</italic> faced potential failure and the government intervened, leading to the restructuring of the banking system in Italy and the establishment of three national banks. By 1933, the liquidation of <italic>Pisa</italic>, Italy\u2019s once dominant private bank began as Mussolini nationalized Italy\u2019s main banks into the state-controlled HC, <italic>Istituto per la Ricostuzione Industriale</italic> (\u201cIRI\u201d), led by Alberto Beneduce. Among other industries, IRI gained control over Italian mercury after Italy nationalized <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic>. \nAs rightists gained control of Spain in 1933, America produces sought to enter the Italian-Spanish mercury cartel per TA1933. Fearing this would encourage Mexican production, Spain left the cartel until June 1934. Despite a renewed agreement, Spanish production remained low. Still, Jewish private bankers continued thriving in Italian Libya. In 1933, the government approved <italic>Nahum\u2019</italic>s construction projects, developing residences, water reservoirs, and schools in Tripoli.\nUnder Chancellor Br\u00fcning in late 1932, GRS ceased aid to cities rolling over foreign debt and infuriated the Junkers by probing agricultural subsidies. Like in 1919, <italic>Styn</italic> partner Kurt Schr\u00f6der hoped to protect German Rhine industry by partnering with Hitler. In January 1933, Schr\u00f6der hosted Papen and Hitler to induce Hindenburg to replace Br\u00fcning. With Papen\u2019s respectability and believing that Hitler could be controlled, the President replaced Br\u00fcning with Papen and Hitler. \nStill, their Nazis did not hold a GRS majority. As Hitler warned industrialists and bankers of Marxist takeover on February 20, leading the heads of <italic>Krupp</italic> and<italic> Vereinigte Stahlwerke</italic> to form a political fund. The largest contributor to the fund were <italic>Farben</italic>\u2019s American investors, particularly Henry Ford, transmitted via <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>\u2019s bank, and <italic>Vereinigte</italic>\u2019s Chair Fritz Thyssen, with his <italic>Bank voor Handel</italic> in Rotterdam and <italic>Union Banking Corp</italic> in New York in collaboration with <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic>. \nGeorge Schnitzler also financed Hitler. While his cousin married Kurt Schr\u00f6der, he descended from the Styns and <italic>Styn</italic> founder Carl Schnitzler apprentice at <italic>Styn</italic> and, in 1912, joined <italic>Hoechst,</italic> where his father served on the board. He joined his family in founding <italic>Farben</italic> in the 1920s and sat on that board. At the same time, the Nazi anti-capitalist rhetoric echoed Marxists. Under Papen, GRS began stabilizing the German <italic>mark</italic> and economy by collecting advance corporate taxes and federalizing city insolvency, taxes, and budgeting. \nFollowing the disbandment of the supra-national steel cartel in early 1931, negotiations among European steel leaders resumed in late 1932. A new contract was established on February 25, 1933, which led to the formation of a new cartel with prices starting in June. When rioters torched GRS\u2019 Berlin statehouse, Nazis blamed foreign Marxists, a <italic>noteverordung</italic> suspended basic rights to protect against Marxist violence for a Nazi electoral victory. When Austrian Nazis blocked government action against a pro-Nazi labor union, Mussolini convinced Dollfuss to end parliamentary government and suspend civil liberties using 1917\u2019s emergency law on March 4th. As the Nazis grew underground, Dollfuss became authoritarian, and became semi-dictatorial. \nIn Germany\u2019s election on March 5th, Marxists won 12% against the Nazi\u2019s 44%. As they centralized power, GRS suspended the constitution without a Nazi majority by March 23rd. Prussia then enacted compulsory city liquidation based on a 1931 Saxon law. Likewise, GRS federalized cartels for the public interest. Hitler extended Papen\u2019s 1932 reforms to stabilize agriculture with price controls, squeezing private capital and curtailing imports with excess profit taxes and a weak currency. Replacing private credit with public works that GRB accepted as collateral, he centralized city budgets and appointed commissioners. \nAlong with replacing <italic>Oppenheim</italic>\u2019s Robert Pferdmenges as Chair of <italic>Association of</italic> <italic>Banks & Bankers in the Rhineland & Westphalia</italic>, Hitler rewarded <italic>St</italic><italic>y</italic><italic>n</italic>\u2019s Kurt Schr\u00f6der by appointing him as the German representative at BIS, GRB advisory boards, directorships, including IT&T, and a brigade leader of the paramilitary forces.<italic> </italic>Starting in 1933, IT&T began transferring funds to Germany, soon accessing the profitable armaments industry which continued for a decade even as political relations broke down. Upon the recommendation of <italic>Merck Finck</italic>\u2019s Baron August Finck of <italic>Allianz</italic> and <italic>Munich Re</italic>, <italic>Allianz</italic> CEO Kurt Schmitt became Reich Minister of Economic Affairs, aiming to moderate Nazi policies.\nWhile Jakob Schapiro, who had spurred the consolidation <italic>Daimler</italic> and <italic>Benz</italic>, fled to Paris, Adolf Rosenberger resigned as commercial director of <italic>Porsche</italic> <italic>Rosenberger</italic>. Despite family pleas through the rise of Hitler, Max Warburg refused to liquidate <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg, determined to defend the firm. However, starting in 1933, Max and his partners were systematically removed from corporate and cultural boards, including GRB\u2019s advisory council, <italic>Hamburg-America Ocean Liner</italic>, <italic>German-Atlantic Telegraph Co</italic>, <italic>Hamburg Chamber of Commerce</italic>, <italic>Philharmonic Society</italic>, and <italic>Board of Higher Education</italic>. As <italic>Reichs-Kredit</italic> absorbed<italic> </italic><italic>Goldschmidt</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Rothschild</italic> Berlin and forced out Jewish Ernst Wallach, the latter publicly opposed foreign boycotts of German goods and urged restraint among American Jewish leaders.\nBy March, GRS gave Nazi lawyers free rein to remove their competition from the profession as Nazi troops attacked Jewish judges and attorneys. Among the assaulted was retired judge Warburg-in-law Otto Kaulla. And as the regime also implemented laws that forbade non-Aryans from representing clients and, 350 Jewish lawyers were disbarred and stripped of their ability to practice their profession. This move effectively removed Jewish influence from the legal system and cemented the Nazi party\u2019s control over the judiciary. \nLikewise, Nazi laws expelled Jewish academics. Among those \u201cnon-Aryans\u201d dismissed from public service were Katz descendants, including law professor Albrecht Mendelssohn Bartholdy and economist Ludwig Mises\u2014a great nephew of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s Lemberg branch manager\u2014who fled Germany for Geneva in 1934 and later emigrated to America. Although Mises, Albert Einstein, and several others found positions at elite American universities secured by Jewish philanthropists, many Jewish scholars faced hostility and job scarcity due to antisemitism and anti-immigrant sentiments. \nAbout 50 of these refugees found work at Historically Black Colleges & Universities in the segregated Jim Crow South. Greek philosophy expert Moritz Manasse had married a Bondi and Porges descendant, and began teaching at<italic> North Carolina</italic> <italic>College for Negroes</italic>, where he influenced students like civil rights lawyer Julius Chambers. Viktor Lowenfeld later joined <italic>Hampton Institute</italic> in Virginia and mentored future muralist John Biggers., Teaching at <italic>Talladega College</italic> in Alabama, Lore May Rasmussen was later fined for sitting with a Black acquaintance in a Birmingham caf\u00e9. \nBy May, Max Warburg and Carl Melchior of Hamburg and <italic>Mendelssohn</italic><italic> </italic>Berlin\u2019s Rudolf Loeb launched a program to counter Jewish economic exclusion, consulting Carl Bosch, Gustav Krupp, and Carl Siemens. They called for ending the boycott, supporting enterprises that retained Jewish employees, removing discriminatory public contract clauses, but redirecting young Jews from urban professions to agriculture and manual labor.\nThat month, the new regime excluded disagreeable GRS members from voting. In June, the Law to Decrease Unemployment replaced female factory workers with men. Married women faced stricter eligibility requirements, leading many to exit the labor market. Soon after, <italic>Dresdner</italic>\u2019s South America-focused subsidiary, <italic>Deutsch-S\u00fcdamerikanische</italic> of Hamburg, affiliated with the government and led by a Nazi party member, laid-off all of her over 200 Jewish employees. Along with social policies, the Nazis embarked on mythical and pagan quests for the Holy Grail in Southern France.\nAs German FX deteriorated, GRB informed BOE that a creditor discussion was necessary, during which <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s Tiarks excluded <italic>Standstill</italic> commercial debts from the moratorium on German external debt interest transfer declared in June. The pair of bankers continued to represent the British banks at GRB meetings for years. By July, GRS allowed <italic>Minster of Economics</italic> to unilaterally declare a cartel contract null and void and delegalized all political parties but Nazis.\nBy then, British coal and steel magnate William Berry acquired <italic>Amalgamated Press</italic> magazine empire, including <italic>Financial Times</italic> and over 70 magazines, an encyclopedia, and printing works. Meanwhile, the Catholic convert Leo Erlanger married a <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast</italic> <italic>Vogue</italic> former junior editor and model. While Cond\u00e9 Nast had been married Leslie Foster, whose father owned Texan oil and gas interests, they divorced in 1932 and she married Grenfell-cousin Robert Benson, who became Chair of <italic>Benson</italic> in London shortly after. \nAs <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast</italic> faced financial challenges from 1932, the Huguenot Cond\u00e9 Nast<italic> </italic>recruited Erlanger to negotiate with William Berry. Throughout 1933, negotiations took place with <italic>Atlas</italic>\u2019 Floyd Oldum and other <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast</italic> investors. After Gerald Schiff Warburg married Nast\u2019s daughter in 1933, Berry married a Rothschild heiress in early 1934, and the deal was successfully concluded, allowing Nast to regain control. And as his nephew and wife died by 1934, <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>\u2019s Ernest Oppenheimer converted to Anglicanism and married his nephew\u2019s British aristocrat widow in 1935. \nSince June 1933, Samuel Untermyer devoted the last years of his years to promoting economic pressure on Nazis as the honorary president of the <italic>National Boycott Committee of America</italic>, while he partnered with LaGuardia, but received public opposition from rabbis and failing to gain critical adoption having sued <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and other banks with the <italic>Pujo Committee</italic>. While America showed a \u2018disinterest\u2019 in the Germany, Britain showed a united front the same month as <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Vivian Smyth\u2019s son married the British royal Katz-descendant granddaughter of Hannah Cohen Samuel Rothschild and former PM Neil Primrose in London that month. \nAs America suspended the gold standard in the <italic>Panic of 1933</italic>, SGE Japan and Munich paid in paper instead of gold, leading <italic>Lazard</italic> London to sue in Dutch courts on behalf of bankers. When MOF struggled to cover budget deficits, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris negotiated with <italic>Paribas</italic> in Brussels, <italic>Laza</italic>rd London, and <italic>Mendelssohn </italic>Amsterdam\u2019s Mannheimer to sell MOF debt. For <italic>Lazard\u2019s</italic> role in alleviating the <italic>franc</italic> crisis, BDF allowed a <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris representative to the <italic>Council of Regency</italic>, David Weill in 1934. David Weill\u2019s distant cousin, Julien Weill, descended from a line of rabbis tracing back to at least the 18th century, became the Chief Rabbi of Paris after his uncle died in 1933. (While his mother was a daughter of Rabbi Heymann Dreyfuss, of Saverne, and the sister of Jacques-Henri Dreyfuss, Chief Rabbi of Belgium and Chief Rabbi of Paris, Julien\u2019s father-in-law had been the Rabbi of France.)\nIn Asia, meanwhile, Robert Brand\u2019s cousin Thomas Freeman serving as Viceroy of India from 1931 to 1936. Like when he served as Governor of Bombay in 1913 and of Madras from 1919, he contended with Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s civil disobedience and shaped the Government of India Act of 1935. Amidst intense competition, Tata\u2019s <italic>India Cement</italic> merged into <italic>Associated Cement Companies</italic> in 1936. By then, Hindu Chettiar holdings of Burmese rice lands grew from 6 to 25% between 1929 and 1936. However, Burmese Buddhists effectively nationalized Chettiar land purchases by 1941. Before then, however, <italic>Lazard</italic> funded Chinese industrialization.\nAfter China\u2019s revolution, Christian convert Ai-ling Soong married HH Kung\u2014the  regional monopoly agent of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, <italic>Royal Dutch</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London funded <italic>Asiatic Petroleum</italic>\u2014in 1915, Soong\u2019s sister Mei-ling married General Chiang Kai-shek. By 1931, their brother, China\u2019s Finance Minister TV Soong, planned to work with <italic>Kuhn</italic> in New York and <italic>Lazard</italic> in London and Paris over two to three years. To handle the German side of the negotiations, Jean Monnet brought Otto Jeidels\u2014Jacob Schiff\u2019s cousin-once-removed and <italic>Berliner</italic> Partner\u2014having worked together on the <italic>Indian Currency Committee</italic>. \nDisagreeing with Chiang over military costs, Soong resigned in 1933. Replacing Soong with Kung as Finance Minister, Chiang allowed Soong to create <italic>China Development Finance Corp</italic> (\u201cCDFC\u201d). Via <italic>League of Nations</italic>, Soong hired Monnet to raise funds from <italic>Lazard </italic>Paris, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Chinoise</italic>, and <italic>Indochine </italic>in 1933. With America\u2019s <italic>Import-Export Bank</italic>, CDFC consolidated roads.\nHowever, America\u2019s <italic>Silver Act of 1934</italic> monetized silver, Chinese silver producers exported their silver rather than sell domestically. And, as China\u2019s currency deflated, banks and importers failed. While Chinese Malaya rubber trader Tan Kah Kee and four native banks in Guangdong\u2019s Shantou, including Gao, collapsed, the Chens expanded their business in Thailand and other locations. As CDFC, Soong-affiliated <italic>Central Bank of China</italic>, and <italic>Sassoon</italic> supported FX, China appointed <italic>Lazard</italic> London as her London agent. While <italic>Morgan </italic>refused to join the effort against Japan, China hired <italic>Kuhn</italic> as her New York agent. \nAs late as 1932, BOE protected HSBC\u2019s position as China\u2019s de facto central bank by refusing a request from TV Soong to nominate <italic>Lloyds Bank</italic> as China\u2019s London agent. When CDFC bid a railway, HSBC rejected her. Likewise, HSBC refused to comply with Kung\u2019s reform and cede her silver. By 1935, BOE\u2019s Governor Norman pressured HSBC to surrender her monetary independence in China. HSBC initially resisted the pressure, but ultimately had to retreat from its earlier demands due to the success of the reform without its compliance. London\u2019s intervention forced HSBC to accept CDFC\u2019s bid. \nSince FDR\u2019s cousin Warren Delano Robbins became American Minister to Canada,  his daughter married, in 1934, Alex Forbes, third cousin once removed of Cameron Forbes\u2014former Ambassador to Japan and FDR\u2019s fourth cousin\u2014who sought the State Department support to revive <italic>Russell</italic> in 1935 to invest in Chinese railways. Nothing came of this.\nMeanwhile, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam\u2019s Mannheimer shifted attention to Paris. Despite <italic>Danat</italic>\u2019s failure, <italic>Kuhn</italic> continued to hold <italic>Bosch</italic> America shares. However, SA1934 led <italic>Kuhn</italic> to sell her <italic>Bosch</italic> America shares to <italic>Mendelssohn </italic>to hold for <italic>Bosch</italic>\u2019s benefit. Mannheimer then appointed Murnane as Chair of<italic> Bosch</italic> America. Murnane also worked with <italic>Solvay</italic>, the Belgian alkaline innovator that created <italic>Finabel</italic> with <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris that soon joined <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and the other <italic>Lazard</italic> houses in BGGE with Andr\u00e9 Meyer on the board. While <italic>Solvay</italic> helped consolidate Austrian banks, <italic>Solvay</italic> also had interests in Germany with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> and launched one the 1930\u2019s most successful IHCs. \nFrom 1930, the Belgian government borrowed heavily, with savings decreasing by 30% and bank deposits falling from 33 to 25 billion Belgian <italic>francs</italic>. In 1933, several small banks, including the Marxist <italic>BBT-BBA</italic> and the Catholic <italic>Algemeene Bankvereeniging</italic>, went bankrupt. By 1934, the credit system collapsed, causing high interest rates despite <italic>Belgian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic> lowering rates to 2%. While <italic>Bankvereeniging</italic> and another bank fused into <italic>Kredietbank</italic>, a decree allowed SNCI-NMKN to convert loans into government-guaranteed bonds for credit, the government secured a loan from <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam to cover daily expenditures. After Belgium devalued her <italic>franc</italic> in 1935, her central bank lowered rates to 2% to little effect.\nAmidst the industrial disarray, <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic>\u2019s creditors asked <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris to salvage the company. With growing losses, <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic>\u2019s filed for bankruptcy by yearend and dismissed 20,000 workers. As Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn passed away from cancer in by 1935, The Chief Rabbi of Paris, Julien Weill, led his funeral. After Pierre Weill failed in organizing a solution, his father David called Andr\u00e9 Meyer, who arranged <italic>Michelin</italic> to buy control in 1935 with <italic>Paribas</italic>. \nWhile David Weill sat on the boards of <italic>Franco-Argentine Mortgage Ban</italic>k and the Argentine <italic>Port of Rosario</italic> PUHC, Pierre Weill was on the boards of <italic>Mexican Eagle Oil Co</italic> and <italic>Canadian Eagle Oil Co</italic>\u2014linking the bank to <italic>Shell</italic>, and Andr\u00e9 Meyer was a director of <italic>Auberive</italic> <italic>Villerupt</italic> Steel and <italic>Reunion Fran\u00e7aise</italic> <italic>Insurance</italic>. <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> withdrew from munitions, allowing <italic>Renault</italic> to virtually monopolize the industry. \n<italic>Lazard</italic> affiliated <italic>Transatlantique</italic> also expanded into South America. Raymond Wallier, born in Paris to Albert Weil and Louise Lambert of unknown lineage, became an attorney in 1923 and served as Deputy Director of <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise et Italienne</italic> in Buenos Aires in 1924 and Paris in 1929. He founded <italic>Wallier</italic> to focus on currency trading in 1932 and became Managing Director of <italic>Transatlantique</italic> in 1936, marrying a Dreyfus, Bloch, and <italic>Lazard</italic> cousin that year.\nSince <italic>l\u2019Electricit\u00e9 Industrielle</italic>\u2019s Pierre Durand\u2014along with his son and nephew\u2014joined <italic>Parisenne</italic>\u2019s board in 1932, <italic>Union d\u2019Electricit\u00e9</italic> PUHC\u2019s Ernest Mercier served on <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 board between 1935 and 1937. By 1936, Mercier strengthened relations with Swiss <italic>Elektrobank</italic>. Since Mercier married Marguerite Dreyfu\u00df\u2014the widow of Adolphe Reinach, niece of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df, and cousin-in-law of Worms and Lazard\u2014his son-in-law Wilfrid Baumgartner joined French Finance Ministry\u2019s General Movement of Funds as Deputy Director, the equivalent of UST Assistant Secretary, in 1929, and director in 1933. \nHe led <italic>Nationale</italic> from 1936, with loan committee directors including Raymond Berr for the chemical industry, Henri Cah\u00e9n in electricity, Joseph Beghin representing sugar and newspapers, and Charles Fould and Mercier for electricity, petroleum, and banking. By 1937, Maurice Petsche, the son of Mercier\u2019s partner Albert Petsche, married Simone Lazard. A daughter of Lucie Goldschmidt and Andr\u00e9 Lazard, a son of one of the five founding brothers, Simone was widowed after the death of French Catholic aristocrat Paul Fressange.\nAlthough <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg and Amsterdam continued function, partner Siegmund Warburg fled Nazi Germany for London in May 1934. Sponsored by prominent figures including the Rothschilds, he submitted a naturalization petition in 1934. Through strategic alliances and discussions with BOE Governor Montague Norman, Warburg established himself in London\u2019s financial sector as conditions in Germany worsened. \nAs Vice Chancellor Papen denounced Nazi suppression of free press and the church, he was arrested and two of his associates were murdered. After his release, Hitler transferred Papen to Vienna as a foreign minister. By August, President Hindenburg died, clearing the way for Hitler to become head of state. Under Nazi intimidation since 1933, Saar united with Germany after a 1935 vote per <italic>Versailles</italic>. As Hitler tariffed Silesian coal (which had been a part of international cartels), Poland secured German concession from 1933. \nSince Italy nationalized <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic> in 1933, the Polish government took over the industrial assets of <italic>Banca</italic>\u2019s <italic>Handlowy Bank</italic>, with<italic> British Overseas Bank</italic>\u2019s <italic>Anglo-Polish Bank</italic> buying what remained. In Latvia, since Adolfs Klive, a co-founder of the Agrarian Union political party, became President of <italic>Bank of Latvia</italic> in 1931, he helped establish <italic>Latvian Credit Bank</italic> in 1935 to stabilize the banking sector and bypass standard banking regulations. Under the Finance Minister, <italic>Credit Bank</italic> acquired many factories in textiles, tobacco, and plywood, often through pressured sales. The acquisitions targeted Jewish-owned businesses, increasing Christian ownership of credit institutions from 20% in 1933 to 90% in 1939.\nSince 1933, <italic>Deutsche</italic> <italic>Disconto </italic>aryanized. Jewish board directors Solmssen, Frank, and Wassermann resigned, while Christians Karl Sippell took over the legal and personnel departments, Fritz Wintermantel managed the Berlin headquarters, Hans Rummel oversaw organization and accounting, and Oswald R\u00e9sler joined to focus on Eastern European acquisitions. The strongest Nazi link was Karl Kimmich, who joined from <italic>Disconto</italic> <italic>Schaafthausen </italic>and whose brother married Joseph Goebbels\u2019 sister. Taking responsibility for <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s industrial clients, he became Chair of GRB\u2019s Credit Committee and drove aryanization starting in 1936.\nLikewise, converted Louis Levy Hagan\u2019s Cologne bank <italic>Levy</italic>, having formed a profit-sharing arrangement with <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, destabilized after the <italic>Panic of 1931</italic>, <italic>Levy</italic> and the death of Hagan. While the banks suspended their profit-sharing arrangement, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> continued to stabilize <italic>Levy</italic>. Promoting the Christian Robert Croon Pferdmenges\u2014former Head of <italic>Disconto</italic> <italic>Schaafthausen</italic>\u2014to Deputy Chair of <italic>Concordia</italic> insurer and other boards in 1933, <italic>Oppenheim </italic>secured \u201cGerman company\u201d status from the Cologne district economic advisor, despite her Jewish origins, but this had little mitigating effect as the Nazis distrusted Pferdmenges. After <italic>Oppenheim</italic> and <italic>Levy</italic> merged, Nazi attacks on the \u201cpurely Jewish bank\u201d  intensified.\nIn 1935, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>\u2019s Managing Partners Franz Mendelssohn and  his cousin-once removed Paul Mendelssohn Bartholdy both died. While Fritz Mannheimer managed <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam without engaging in the Berlin business, other co-owners included Franz\u2019s widow, son, and son-in-law, Paul Kempner, Louis Levy Hagan\u2019s nephew. Rudolf L\u00f6b\u2014Paul Kempner\u2019s second cousin, Alex Coppel\u2019s great grandson, Louis Hagen\u2019s first cousin once removed, and extended cousin-in-law of the Hirchlands\u2014became <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>\u2019s first non-family Managing Partner. <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>\u2019s only Aryan partner was Paul\u2019s widow, who held capital as a silent partner. Despite political difficulties, the bank remained profitable. \nIndeed, as GRB found that <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, <italic>Warburg</italic>, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Arnhold Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Hirschland</italic>, and a few other \u201cJewish\u201d banks grew at twice the rate of Aryan banks since 1932, Nazis forced more Jews to sell assets at depressed prices to aryanize banks and industry from 1935. By 1937, the six-generation old private bank <italic>Bondi </italic>of Dresden sold out to <italic>Deutsche Disconto</italic>. In July, Hermann Schwabach and Hans Arnhold retired from <italic>Arnhold Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> citing health reasons. While Martin Aufh\u00e4user left <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> to manage <italic>Aufh\u00e4user</italic>, Julius Schwabach and Christian <italic>Dresdner</italic> partner Walther Frisch managed both banks. By December, 35-year-old Julius died under unclear circumstances and <italic>Arnhold</italic> took over <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, with Frisch as sole managing partner and Hermann Schwabach as silent partners. \nSoon after, <italic>Arnhold Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> sold their German operations to <italic>Dresdner</italic>, but managed to open <italic>Arnhold Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> New York. As aryanization policies reduced her customer base, <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt recorded her final profit and began preparing for liquidation. While the Dreyfu\u00df family and Werner Mankiewitz fled to Switzerland, the Lutheran Paul Wallich remained in Germany even as his son Henry moved to New York to join <italic>Chemical</italic> NB. \nSince <italic>Hardy</italic> Berlin faced liquidity issues during the <italic>Panic of 1931</italic> and required <italic>Dresdner</italic>\u2019s support, Rathenau in-law Fritz Andrea, resigned as Managing Director of <italic>Hardy</italic>, but remained its general authorized signatory and continued serving on <italic>Dresdner</italic>\u2019s board. By 1936, the \u201chalf-Jewish\u201d Andreae resigned from his directorates as <italic>Dresdner </italic>acquired <italic>Hardy</italic> Berlin. By 1937, Walter Sulzbach transferred management of <italic>Sulzbach</italic> to his Christian son-in-law, Heinrich Kirchholtes. Later that year, party authorities pressured Kirchholtes to appoint a Nazi-affiliated banker as senior staff. Likewise, <italic>Burkhardt </italic>aryanized <italic>Hirschland</italic>.\nWhile harassing Jewish industrialists, the Germany state took a direct interest in credit and industry. GRS federalized and reoriented public works and electricity to armament from 1935. Soon after, bankruptcy reforms shifted to the public interest, forcing compositions for favored debtors, and liquidating others. \nIn 1935, Gestapo forces arrested <italic>Porsche</italic> <italic>Rosenberger</italic>\u2019s former commercial director Adolf Rosenberger for \u201crace defilement\u201d after dating a Christian woman. He was imprisoned for three weeks and sent to Kislau concentration camp. After being released, Rosenberger transferred his 10% stake in <italic>Porsche</italic> to the Porsche family\u2014who did not help while he was imprisoned\u2014to comply with aryanization, and left Germany for Paris, where he continued to represent <italic>Porsche</italic> by licensing patents internationally. Two years later, Porsche partnered with Hitler to found <italic>Volkswagen</italic> to create low-priced, small car for ordinary consumers, but used Jewish slave labor to produce military vehicles soon after.\nFailing to moderate Nazi policies, <italic>Allianz</italic> CEO Kurt Schmitt resigned as Reich Minister of Economic Affairs<italic> </italic>in 1934. Despite this, Finck maintained control over his interests in <italic>Allianz</italic> and <italic>Munich Re</italic>, which complied with Nazi mandates to increase investments in government war loans beginning in 1935. Along with Jews, Lutheran private bankers like <italic>Metzler</italic> in Frankfurt suffered without government support and faced credit restrictions from GRB. The number of private banking firms associated with joint-stock companies in Frankfurt, dropping from 24 in 1932 to eight in 1938. \nEarly in 1935, Dutch courts dismissed <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s suit that Indonesian debt be made in gold. As BDF offered short-term advances for MOF bonds for MMMOF, large banks concerned about private bonds opposed the policy. Likewise, Fran\u00e7ois Wendel and other BDF Regents opposed subordinating BDF\u2019s autonomy to foreign America and international bankers, such as <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Lazard</italic>. Still, <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris\u2019 Nelson Jay married Diana Draper, a second cousin twice removed of FDR and cousin-in-law of the Langhornes, tightening bonds with America and Britain.\nAlarmed by Nazis, however, moderates united with Marxists to rearm under L\u00e9on Blum, a Jewish in-law of Oppenheim and Goudchaux cousins. As Blum sought to eliminate war profiteering, MOF allowed him to nationalize to-be-determined industries. So, he nationalized BDF, abolishing her <italic>Council of Regency</italic> and installing a <italic>General Council</italic> to represent France. After nationalizing <italic>Bloch-Dassault Aviation,</italic> Blum retained<italic> </italic>Marcel Allatini Bloch as Administrator. \nAs Blum\u2019s administration worked with political allies, including <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, where his grandnephew Jean Bloch-Lain\u00e9 was a partner, <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris complained about the preference for Jewish bankers. While Blum lost support of most French bankers and France devalued the <italic>franc</italic>, <italic>Paribas\u2019</italic> Finaly continued to advise him and floated a government loan with <italic>Lazard</italic> London sold debt. To consolidate shareholdings in friendly hands, improve, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> became <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic>two largest owners.\nSince BOE rescued <italic>Anglo-South American Bank</italic> in the <italic>Panic of 1931</italic>, conditions continued to deteriorate.<italic> </italic>In 1934, Anthony Drexel\u2019s grandson John Drexel of <italic>Bonbright</italic> was elected director of <italic>Anglo-South </italic>and <italic>Lloyd</italic>\u2019s<italic> Bank of London & South America</italic> in 1934. The same year, a daughter of Earl of Winchilsea Guy Montagu Finch-Hatton\u2014Drexel\u2019s brother-in-law and partner at <italic>Bonbright</italic>\u2014wed <italic>Schr\u00f6der </italic>London heir Peter Tiarks. \nThe following year, Finch-Hatton\u2019s son married Gladys Vanderbilt Szechenyi\u2014whose parents were Count L\u00e1szlo Szechenyi, a Hungarian Minister to America and Britain, and a daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt II. Likewise, Finch-Hatton\u2019s daughter married Whitney Straight, a nephew of William Payne Whitney. By 1936, BOE sold what was left of <italic>Anglo-South American Bank</italic> to<italic> Bank of London & South America</italic>.\nAmidst disputes over Jewish members, <italic>Anglo-German Association</italic> dissolved in 1935. In October 1935, <italic>Anglo-German Fellowship</italic> started with financial backing organized by Ernest Tennant, a merchant banker and associate of Nazi officials. Tennant, whose uncle had chaired <italic>Union Bank of Scotland</italic>, served as Honorary Secretary. Wilfrid Ashley, a widower of Ernest Cassel\u2019s daughter, was Chair. Founding members including <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s Frank Tiarks and <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Kindersley, who joined at the request of <italic>Lever</italic>. Along with politicians and aristocrats, corporate members included <italic>Imperial Chemical Industries</italic> and <italic>Dunlop</italic>. The <italic>Fellowship</italic> maintained ties with <italic>Deutsch-Englische Co </italic>in Berlin and promoted Nazi policies by distributing literature, screening films, and arranging rallies. \nSome, like Charles Stewart, Marquess of Londonderry, had affiliated with the <italic>Association</italic> before becoming Air Minister and Leader of the House of Lords. More than with the <italic>Fellowship</italic>, he allied with Tennant and Ashley. Likewise, his wife hosted a circle that included Winston Churchill. Like Ashley, Stewart had kinterlinked with Jews, as his daughter wed a Goldsmid cousin in 1935. Supporting pro-German King Edward VIII, Stewart viewed Germany as a potential ally. While Stewart was forced to resign as Air Minister in late 1935, the King abdicated a year later, after marrying American divorcee against Anglican traditions. He was succeeded by his younger brother, who became King George VII, making his wife, Elizabeth Lyon Bowes\u2014Abel Smyth\u2019s third great granddaughter and third great niece of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire\u2014the Queen.\nMeanwhile, since <italic>pound</italic> devaluation, tariffs, and steel consolidation, British pressure on European steel exporters grew. By 1935, Britain joined the supra-national steel cartel to restrict and license imports. Other industries also consolidated. While Auckland Anderson Geddes was Chair of <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> from 1925 until his death in 1954, his brother Eric served as chair of <italic>Dunlop Rubber</italic> and <italic>Imperial Airways</italic>, which formed in 1924 to serve as Britain\u2019s designated airline for international services. \nAlthough <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic> had financed one of the world\u2019s first commercial airline companies\u2014<italic>KLM Royal Dutch </italic><italic>Airways</italic>\u2014in 1919 and dominated flights in the Netherlands, the airline had her first transatlantic flight in 1934. From 1924, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s extended Catholic cousin Leo Erlanger became an <italic>Imperial Airways</italic> shareholder. When the founder of the small and recently publicly floated airline, <italic>Hillman Airways</italic> died in 1934, Leo bought the airline and merged her with <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s <italic>United Air Lines</italic> in 1935 to form <italic>British Airways</italic>, with his cousin Gerard Erlanger as a director.\nThis also spurred French airlines to consolidate. Since <italic>Rothchild</italic> Paris named Rene Mayer a Director of <italic>Nord</italic> RHC in 1928, he became VP of the board in 1932. In August 1933, Mayer helped four private French air transport companies\u2014<italic>Air Union</italic>, SGTA, CIDNA, and <italic>Air Orient</italic>\u2014merge and takeover <italic>Aeropostale</italic> to create <italic>Air France</italic>. In 1937, he negotiated the reorg of France\u2019s railroad sector and merged the networks into <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Chemins de fer Fran\u00e7ais</italic>.\nAs American GE-controlled HC <italic>Associated Electrical Industries</italic> (\u201cAEI\u201d)\u2014including the non-integrated <italic>British Thomson Houston</italic> and <italic>Vickers</italic>\u2014competed to build Egypt\u2019s first import-substitution <italic>Aswan Dam</italic>-powered nitrate factory. Working with <italic>Mellon</italic>-affiliated <italic>Cyanamid</italic>, AEI sought to create a British facade to gain diplomatic support for their consortium, but competitors labeled them as \u2018<italic>American with an English veneer</italic>.\u2019 Concerned about foreign industrial control, BOE\u2019s Governor led GE to sell BGE and AEI. \n<italic>Danat\u2019</italic>s Jakob Goldsmith brokered the sale to <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s <italic>English Electric</italic> without FX. By then, <italic>Atlas</italic> was ready to withdraw from given PA1935. With an act of Parliament in 1936, <italic>Lazard</italic> London organized <italic>Prudential Assurance</italic> for <italic>Imperial Continental Gas Association</italic> (\u201cICGA\u201d) to buy <italic>Atlas</italic>\u2019 British assets. The repatriation of American-held shares and the establishment of British control marked the completion of domestication. \nLikewise, as the Court supported FA1933 in separating American and commercial investment banks, <italic>Morgan </italic>remained a commercial NB as Grenfell and Smyth cousins out of London of <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> took over <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s non-American holdings. Although <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> floated the Indian branch, <italic>Yule Catto</italic>, Vivian Smyth remained a director of both and worked closely with Catto when he later became a director of BOE. Likewise, relations among the other <italic>Morgan </italic>entities remained strong. \nSince fleeing from Berlin after working for <italic>Wassermann</italic>, <italic>Kuhn-</italic>heir Joseph Loeb\u2019s stepson joined <italic>First Boston</italic> London as Chair, while remaining a partner at <italic>Michelis\u00a0</italic>in Zurich. Robert Boothby was another partner, The son of a <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic> director, grand-nephew of former BOE Governor Cunliffe, and a second cousin of a Baring, Boothby had been a Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill\u2019s private secretary. That year, Bootby married a Cavendish, whose second cousin once removed was <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Brand. Likewise, British bankers and aristocrats continued to reinforce interests as the son of Reginald McKenna, Chair of <italic>Midland</italic>, Britain\u2019s largest bank, married a noble descendant of Abel Smyth and Francis Baring.\nBy 1936, however, BOE retreated from discounting lease bills. Likewise, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s Tiarks stopped representing British banks at GRB in Berlin. Since merging with <italic>K\u00f6nig</italic> per BOE after the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, <italic>Huth</italic> suffered acceptance losses<italic> </italic>since the <italic>Standstill</italic>. In 1936, BOE convinced <italic>British Overseas Bank </italic>to take over<italic> Huth</italic>, leading<italic> Huth</italic> heirs Daniel and Luke Meinertzhagen to join <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Cazenove</italic>, respectively. By late 1937, BOE and other investors deposited funds to keep <italic>British Overseas Bank </italic>liquid.\n<italic>Tate Lyle</italic>\u2019s monopoly over British sugar refining from 1921 ended after the creation of state-owned <italic>British Sugar Corp</italic> in 1936. Since BOE\u2019s <italic>Bankers\u2019 Industrial Dev </italic>HC worked with Grenfell-cousin <italic>Benson</italic> for <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> to take over <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> Britain operated by <italic>Rothschild</italic>-cousin <italic>Merton</italic> while forcing steel, coal, and cotton consolidation, By 1938, a second granddaughter of <italic>Tate Lyle</italic> founder Henry Tate married a noble cousin of <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Grenfell and Smyth families. Likewise, the Tate and Lyle families kinterlinked with cousins of the West Indies sugar trading Bevan family, of which <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Brand was a member.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Eurasian</italic><italic> Panics of </italic><italic>World War II</italic>\nSince Saudi Arabia annexed the Kingdom of Hejaz, debts mounted as the Depression declined Mecca pilgrimage revenues. In 1933, Saudi Arabia\u2019s signed an agreement with <italic>OIL of California</italic> over <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> to explore oil in the country. After intense negotiations, the European coal-exporting countries reached a deal to terminate ruinous competition among coke exporters, particularly in Scandinavian markets. The agreement sets a minimum average selling price and export quotas based on 1934 exports, freezing German, Belgian, British, and Polish shares at 52, 24, 21, and 3%. \nThrough the 1920s, John Cadman and William Fraser helped <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> resolve conflicts with <italic>Shell</italic> and <italic>OIL </italic>by 1934. (From 1935, <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> became <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic>). While the Dutch<italic> </italic>joined British cartels against deflation since 1932, they remained on gold to fend off Japan until 1936. When <italic>OIL</italic> and <italic>Shell</italic> curbed sales to Japan and the Dutch left the gold standard, Japan nationalized coal-based industries. \nFocused on Soviet oilfields since the 1920s, Belgo-French oil refinery <italic>Petrofina</italic> and servicer <italic>Schlumberger</italic> shifted focus to Romania and the Americas. While <italic>Petrofina </italic>agreed to trade arms for oil with Romania, Romanian heavy industrial firm <italic>Re\u0219i\u021ba</italic> indemnified British <italic>Vickers</italic> for arms production liabilities By 1936, <italic>Sullivan </italic>closed their Berlin office and the American <italic>Vereinigte Stahlwerke </italic>HC defaulted, falling into bankruptcy. Meanwhile, Hitler prioritized synthetic oil production by the mostly-Nazi led <italic>Farben</italic>. \nAs Spain\u2019s Communists sought to speed up transformation, they began mass collectivization and disenfranchising moderates and rightists. Amidst the move towards regional autonomy and Marxism, Spain\u2019s military led by Francisco Franco to stabilize the state. Franco\u2019s financier was Juan March.\nBorn into poverty in Majorca, March purchased a tobacco factory in Algeria by 1906. Expanding in North Africa, he gained the tobacco monopoly in French Morocco in 1910. During WWI, he traded food to the Allies and oil to Germany, becoming Spain\u2019s richest man. In 1932, the Spanish Parliament imprisoned him for smuggling and illegal tobacco sales. Released by right-wing government a year later, he transferred wealth abroad through <italic>Kleinwort</italic> in London. \nIn 1936, March traveled between Biarritz and Rome, supporting conspirators against the Republican government. With credit from <italic>Kleinwort</italic>, March funded flights for Franco and the purchase of Italian bombers. Since the ensuing civil war halted export of pyrites to Germany, Franco controlled mercury and silver mines. With March intermediating funds, Hitler sent coal to Franco to fuel German armament and Mussolini secretly allowed Franco to sell mercury outside of the cartel. \nWhile the Soviet Union aided the Republican side, L\u00e9on Blum\u2019s leftist government faced pressure from both wings in France. To maintain support from the British government, which was concerned about Marxist influence in France, Blum stayed neutral in Spain\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic>. However, this stance was unpopular with many on the left. As the government faced increasing financial difficulties by June 1937, <italic>Paribas\u2019</italic> President\u2014former BDF Governor \u00c9mile Moreau\u2014published what was interpreted as entering the political debate. With growing shareholder concern, Finaly resigned. Blum followed shortly after as Spain\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic> intensified. \nIn China, meanwhile, HH Kung nationalized <italic>Bank of China</italic>, firing Board Chair Li Ming and the CEO, replacing both with TV Soong. By 1936, <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> abandoned her organization around transportation. Along with <italic>Bank of China</italic>, Soong focused expansion of both banks to the southwest and northwest to integrate Chinese western cities against Japan. TV Soong\u2019s brother, TL, soon served as General Manager of <italic>Manufacturers Bank of China</italic> and a director of <italic>Bank of China</italic>, <italic>Bank of Communications</italic>, and <italic>Farmers Bank</italic>. By 1942, TL married a daughter of Te-Mou Hsi, General Manager of <italic>Central Bank of China</italic>. Likewise, Kung\u2019s son Lingkan managed <italic>Yangtze Development Corp</italic>.\nAs <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris joined banks in financing <italic>Bank of China</italic> in 1937 and a railway from Indochina to Nanking soon after, in early 1937, Lehman in-law and <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Benjamin Buttenwieser\u2019s sister Gertrude married Werner Prins, the son of an Amsterdam diamond merchant and descendant of Katz, Joseph Goldschmidt, Simon Bondi, and Lipman Cohen-Behrens, whose brother had married a Sassoon. In July 1937, Japan invaded China. As France and China sought to connect Hanoi to Nanjing, <italic>Monnet Murnane</italic> raised <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Chinoise</italic>, and <italic>Indochine </italic>funds to invest with <italic>China Development Finance Corp</italic><italic>.</italic><italic></italic> \nAnd over the following year, Stalin\u2019s 1937 Great Purge of Soviet party leadership often replaced Gunzburg cousins and other Communist intellectuals with provincial antisemites, with few Jews left in government. That year, Lazar Kaganovich, the Soviet Union\u2019s highest-ranking individuals of Jewish heritage, became Deputy Chairman of the Council of People\u2019s Commissars and then Commissar of the Oil Industry, his brother rose from Deputy People\u2019s Commissar of Heavy Industry to People\u2019s Commissar of the Defense Industry. By then, their niece-in-law married a Dynin cousin, related to the Katz, Gunzburg, and Polyakov families.\nIn 1937, <italic>Lazard</italic> London announced that Poland\u2019s <italic>pound</italic> and <italic>dollar</italic> denominated debts were about to go into default. By yearend, they partially settled. By then, however, as the government increasingly intervened in the economy, Polish political leaders supported Nazi-inspired antisemitic legislation. After <italic>Polish Medical Association</italic> and <italic>Polish Bar Association</italic> adopted Aryan paragraphs, organizations including the Wilno journalists\u2019 association and <italic>Bank Polski</italic> prohibited even converted Jews in 1938. These actions culminated in the Minister of Justice gaining indefinite authority to close professional rolls.\nDespite goals of international mutual trust, Nazis horrified moderate Germans. While aristocrat Helmuth Moltke refused to accept appointment as a judge in 1933, he advocated humane treatment of prisoners of war as an attorney. In 1937, Carl Goerdeler, who served as Leipzig\u2019s Mayor since 1930, resigned due to Nazi attempts to discredit Felix Mendelssohn, which included removing the composer\u2019s statue and banning his music. Following his resignation, Goerdeler traveled across Europe, warning Winston Churchill. Goerdeler and Moltke met as the latter extended his contacts to church and opposition leaders. \nWith the death of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York Prentiss Gray in 1935, Gerald Beal\u2014whose father-in-law John McHugh led <italic>Chase</italic>\u2014became President. In line with SA1934, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York spun off investment banking activities into <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> <italic>Rockefeller</italic> in 1936, with partners including Percy Stillman Rockefeller and Gerald Donovan, son-in-law of George Bovenizer,<italic> Kuhn</italic>\u2019s first non-Jewish partner. <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Allen Dulles became a director of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York the following year. \nAmidst low prices led <italic>OIL</italic> to put her Bolivian options for sale, leading the country to nationalize her assets. Mexico also passed a nationalization law, and union protests escalated until hers Court voted against <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s oil cartel in March 1938. As America boycotted Mexico for the expropriation, Hitler bought Mexican oil. While the boycott soon ended, \n<italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> London became the German financial agent in Britain agent in 1938, and <italic>Rockefeller</italic> and other Americans developed oil in Venezuela. Aged 65 in 1939, Tiarks\u2019 retired from active involvement with <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> London as WWII started, critics of appeasement attacked him. Tiarks remained on BOE\u2019s Court until 1945, and stepped down from <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic> shortly before dying in 1952. \nPerhaps the only firm to try to make inroads into Mexico and Spain, was <italic>Citi</italic>, by promoting George Moore. Born in Hannibal, Missouri, in 1905, Moore\u2019s father inspected railroad claims. After a year at <italic>Washington Uni</italic> in Saint-Louis, Moore transferred to <italic>Yale</italic> on a scholarship in 1926. Following his graduation, Moore joined <italic>Farmers\u2019 Loan & Trust Co</italic>, which soon merged into <italic>Citi</italic>. Only after Moore married Beatriz Braniff Bermejillo, a granddaughter of Thomas Braniff and the daughter of the King of Spain\u2019s Protocol Chief, in 1938 did he become a VP within months.\nAs Mussolini funded public road pavement in 1935, resource-poor Italy imported German coal and annexed oil-rich Libya. By 1936, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia led <italic>Morgan </italic>to eliminate Italian credit lines. To limit bank competition, Italy\u2019s banking law of that year banned security investments, geographic diversification, share ownership in non-financial companies, and other non-bank activities. \nMussolini also mandated cartels. From 1938, racial laws spread through Italy. Beyond instructions from Mussolini\u2019s regime, IRI and other private companies proposed new and more stringent forms of control. Like Edgardo Morpurgo was dismissed from <italic>Generali</italic>, prominent Jewish families disappeared from Italian business. Even the cotton banking Pinto Alhadeff family that industrialized the Italian island of Rhodes were barred from sending their children to school.\nDuring this period, Enrico Cuccia emerged as Fascist Italy\u2019s rising banking star. Born in Rome to a political Sicilian family, Cuccia began his career at Italy\u2019s central bank. After he moved to IRI in 1934, he eventually moved to the state-controlled <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic> in 1938, where he married Beneduce\u2019s daughter in 1939.  While Mussolini imposed similar racial laws in Libya, Governor Balbo advised adjusting Italy\u2019s anti-Jewish laws, stressing that the economies of Tripoli and Benghazi would collapse. \nIn the 1930s, <italic>Petschek</italic> sought advice from <italic>Sullivan</italic>, and Allen Dulles arranged for George Murnane to \u2018buy\u2019 their Czech coal mines and hold them on their behalf. However, the Germans opted to buy the mines outright from Murnane, leaving him with a tax liability. Despite Dulles remaining on the board, this transaction allowed the Nazis to gain access to critical resources. The Petschek family soon fled to America.\nSince receiving investment from <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris after WWI, <italic>Union Bank of Bohemia</italic>\u2019s Herbert and Francis Bondy traded with London for metals needed for arms production.  While they established a plant in Mantov to produce pure silver bars from coins collected by the Czechoslovak government, Herbert was a Director of <italic>Silver & Metal Works</italic> in Slovakia, the only silver-plating factory for flatware and household silverware in Czechoslovakia. But Herbert emigrated to Buenos Aires, and Francis moved to New York in 1939.\nSince <italic>Texas\u2019 Railway Commission</italic> (\u201cTRC\u201d)<italic> </italic>controlled American oil from 1933, Britain licensed oil in 1934. But as war approached, Parliament nationalized coal royalties in 1938. While calling Britain to resume overseas lending, Kindersley argued for government intervention to address economic inequality and provide necessities. He advocated for a social safety net, including unemployment insurance, and old age pension. By 1938, America joined the supra-national steel cartel to mutually recognize exclusive spheres of influence. And as Alex Fraser rose through the ranks at <italic>Shell</italic> in America, he became president in 1939. After John Cadman\u2019s death in 1941, William Fraser became Chair of <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic>.\nOver this time, Christian bankers consolidated power in Germany and France. Joseph Goebbels\u2019 brother-in-law Karl Kimmich led <italic>Deutsche Disconto</italic>\u2019s industrial clients as a board director and Chaired GRB\u2019s Credit Committee to drive aryanization from 1936, Hermann Abs joined <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Board in 1937 and led the Foreign Department in 1938.\nThe Catholic son of a prominent Prussian lawyer, Abs joined <italic>Heydt</italic><italic> </italic>and then <italic>Rhodius Koenigs</italic>, married Inez Schnitzler\u2014a descendant of <italic>St</italic><italic>y</italic><italic>n</italic>\u2019s Carl Schnitzler like <italic>Farben</italic>\u2019s George Schnitzler\u2014in 1927, and then moved to <italic>Delbr\u00fcck</italic> <italic>Schickler</italic>. Although Abs never joined the Nazi party, he oversaw <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s acquisitions in occupied lands\u2014quadrupling assets\u2014with directorships on over 40 boards, including <italic>Farben</italic>. \nIn 1938, Paul Thomasson became a Director of <italic>Paribas</italic>, representing <italic>Bank of Syria & Lebanon</italic>, <italic>TURK</italic>, <italic>Radio-France</italic>, <italic>Cie G\u00e9n. des Colonies</italic>, <italic>Cie G\u00e9n. du Maroc</italic>, <italic>Ch. de fer du Maroc Oriental</italic>. Thomasson had begun his career as an Inspector of Finances and later served as Director and General Manager of <italic>Banque de l\u2019Union des Mines</italic>\u2014launched by collieries in 1923\u2014in 1931 and Director at <italic>L\u2019Urbaine-Vie</italic> in 1934. Married in 1927, Thomasson\u2019s wife was the granddaughter of an administrator of <italic>Saint-Gobain</italic> and niece by marriage of bankers <italic>Lehideux</italic>. Her mother was a first cousin once removed of Paul Leroy-Beaulieu, representative of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris on <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic>\u2019s board at the turn of the century.\nOther bankers gained too from Jewish dispossession. In 1937, the Nazis threatened Kurg Landsberg with deportation to a concentration camp, leading <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt to close and transforming <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel into a joint-stock company soon after. While <italic>Metzler </italic>gained the Frankfurt operations, <italic>Merck</italic> <italic>Finck</italic> absorbed the Berlin branch. Facing the erosion of his professional and personal life, Paul Wallich soon committed suicide. \nWallich\u2019s former partner Otto Jeidels maintained his position in <italic>Berliner</italic> despite increasing antisemitism as he the German <italic>Standstill</italic> Committee from the early 1930s. Due to the abuse of his family and the imminent reclassification of his bank as a Jewish institution, which would result in a 95% loss of his wealth, Jeidels emigrated to America in early 1938. As he prepared to leave, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul recruited him. \nAltschul faced challenges in securing a position for Jeidels due to suspicions about his alliances, especially after <italic>Time</italic> magazine labeled Jeidels \u201c<italic>a present from Adolf Hitler</italic>.\u201d Before Anglo-American authorities stopped investigating him, Jeidels defended his views on Germany\u2019s military strengths and maintained that he never admired the Nazi regime, while keeping ties with German bankers like <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Hermann Abs.\nIn 1937, GRB warned <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Berlin that the bank would face increasing challenges due to her Jewish ownership and needed to prepare for aryanization. As long-time authorized signatory, Alfred Kurzmeyer, betrayed the bank by offering client information to <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Hermann Abs for a takeover, the decision was finalized following the April 1938 laws and the registration requirement for Jewish businesses. With the Mendelssohn family forced out, <italic>Deutsche</italic> rewarded Kurzmeyer with a <italic>Deutsche</italic> directorship.\nIn Czechoslovakia, <italic>Farben</italic> tried to penetrate <italic>Spolek Bank</italic> through their <italic>Bratislava Dynamit Nobel</italic> company, but <italic>Zivnostenska Bank </italic>and <italic>Solvay</italic> resisted, aiming to maintain their Anglo-French connections. By early 1937, <italic>Agrarian Bank</italic> and <italic>Kooperativa</italic> persuaded <italic>Imperial Chemical Industries</italic> (\u201cICI\u201d) to sell shares to them, with equal stakes with <italic>Zivnostenska </italic>and <italic>Spolek</italic>. By mid-July, ICI decided to remain involved. <italic>Solvay</italic>, seeking to counter German influence, convinced ICI to stay, aligning British, French, and Belgian interests. Likewise, <italic>Farben</italic> helped plan the invasion of Czechoslovakia and subsequent coal incorporation. \nAfter annexing outer Czechoslovakia, Hitler annexed Austria by March 1938, as part of Nazi efforts to control natural resources. In line with the antisemitic policies of the Nazi regime, <italic>Deutsche</italic> engulfed <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna and other Jewish-owned banks, while G\u00f6ring\u2019s <italic>Reichswerke </italic>acquired their Romanian oil shares, along with the Petschek coal mines with other holdings into an international HC. \nSimilarly, Vienna bank <italic>Rosenfeld</italic>\u2014cousins of the Poppers and Wilhelm Kux, who was forced of <italic>Alpine Mining Co</italic><italic> </italic>in 1930\u2014was aryanizied. Having overseen the aryanization of <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfort\u2019s Berlin branch, <italic>Merck Finck</italic>\u2019s Baron August Finck of <italic>Allianz</italic> and <italic>Munich Re</italic> also transferred ownership of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna to Aryan control. However, while <italic>Reitzes</italic>, which had come under control of Hans Reitzes\u2019s aristocratic Christian widow, Maria Marienwert, avoided administration, authorities revoked the bank\u2019s FX license and ordered liquidation.\nBy May 1938, the Nazi aryanization campaign propagated anti-Jewish laws and regulations to purge Jews from German economic life.  Since <italic>Berliner</italic>\u2019s Hans Natanson F\u00fcrstenberg moved to the Administrative Board in 1935, he was forced off it. Likewise, <italic>Oppenheim</italic>\u2019s Jewish partners were forced to resign and the Oppenheim family withdrew from public life. As <italic>Oppenheim</italic> rebranded as <italic>Pferdmenges</italic>, Robert Pferdmenges became Chair of <italic>Colonia</italic> and other Oppenheim companies as his nephew-in-law joined <italic>Pferdmenges</italic>. Likewise, Jewish family members redeemed silent capital and <italic>Sulzbach</italic> was renamed <italic>Kirchholtes</italic>.\nAs Max Warburg relinquished control to office manager Rudolf Brinckmann and Hamburg merchant Paul Wirtz,<italic> </italic>the two-century year old <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg transformed into <italic>Brinckmann Wirtz</italic>, to erase its Jewish identity. By August, Max and his family were granted preference under the strict quota system as children of American citizens under the <italic>Immigration Act of 1924</italic>, and fled to New York in 1938, where his son Eric founded <italic>Warburg</italic> New York. While the Warburgs expected to return to Hamburg within months, the <italic>Kristallnacht</italic> pogrom came on November 10, 1938, ushering in state-supported antisemitic violence throughout Nazi controlled Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia, with dozens of Jewish killed, hundreds of synagogues burned, thousands of businesses pilfered, and tens of thousands of Jews arrested.\nAs Fritz Oppenheim Warburg visited Hamburg from Sweden, the Gestapo arrested him and detained as a potential hostage during the seizures of Jewish property. Only in May 1939 did Hamburg banking heir Cornelius Berenberg Gossler, a member of the Nazi Party and a second cousin of Warburg\u2019s sister-in-law Mary Gossler Hertz, secured Warburg\u2019s release. From that point forward, it was clear that any Warburg who returned to Germany faced certain arrest.\nIn Munich, five hundred Jews were arrested, and all Jews in the city were given two days to leave Germany. However, petrol stations refused to serve them, and the Gestapo seized passports, preventing consulates from issuing visas. A partner of the <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> linked Jewish private bank<italic> Aufh\u00e4user</italic>, Emil Kraemer, was among the first allegedly to commit suicide. As Nazis took control of his bank, they claimed the paralyzed man jumped out of his apartment window. Similarly, they claimed his wife poisoned herself in reaction to his suicide, but she did so half an hour before Kraemer\u2019s death. Soon after,<italic> Aufh\u00e4user</italic> was aryanized and rebranded into <italic>Seiler</italic>. By then, most of Germany\u2019s estimated 345 Jewish private banks existing in 1935 had been liquidated. While aryanization was rare, <italic>Dresdner </italic>absorbed at least 20 Jewish-owned private banks.\nBefore the Nazis forced confiscation, the children of Germany\u2019s wealthiest pre-WWI individual, Maximilian Goldschmidt Rothschild, emigrated after selling their Frankfurt assets. Unable to leave at age 95, Maximilian was forced to sell his property and art collection at a steep discount to the city of Frankfurt. His remaining assets were used for an \u2018atonement payment\u2019, and after his death, his property was confiscated. Soon after, Maximilian\u2019s son Albert committed suicide in Switzerland. \nSince <italic>Reichs-Kredit</italic> absorbed<italic> </italic><italic>Goldschmidt</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Rothschild</italic> Berlin and forced out Ernst Wallach in 1933, the Wallachs remained in Germany until 1938, when they immigrated to America. His son also married a daughter of deceased <italic>Deutsche</italic> partner Oskar Wasserman and represented Eric Goldschmidt Rothschild\u2019s interests in America. Remaining in Germany, Ernst\u2019s brother Fritz of<italic> Boehm Reitzenbaum</italic>, was arrested, and perished at Auschwitz despite paying off Nazi officials.\nSimilarly, from Austria, <italic>Ephrussi</italic>\u2019s head fled to London along with most Rothschilds. While the head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna, Louis, elected stay, he transferred ownership of the Czech <italic>Witkowitz</italic> ironworks to <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Alliance Assurance</italic> and granted disposal rights for his Austrian assets to <italic>Kuhn</italic>.\nAs <italic>Reichswerke</italic> sought to absorb <italic>Witkowitz</italic>, the gestapo arrested <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s Louis Rothschild for almost a year before extorting <italic>Witkowitz</italic> in a record ransom for his release. Thousands of other Jews committed suicide to avoid deportation to death camps. Since Nazis began forcefully sterilizing German mulatto children in 1937, the violence and brutality of the Nazi regime increased in 1938, resulting in the industrial-scale genocide of Jews, dissidents, and other minority groups. After GE left Germany in 1938, Germany refunded GE\u2019s <italic>Young Plan</italic> investment.\nFrom Britain, Nicholas Winton traveled to Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia in 1938, and organized the rescue of 669 Jewish children to Britain. Born in London to likely descendants of Samson Wertheim, Nicholas was baptized. While his father changed his surname to Wortham during WWI in 1915, his mother anglicized the family name to Winton in 1938. Like his father, Winton worked in banking, including <italic>Behrens</italic> in Hamburg, <italic>Wassermann</italic> in Berlin, and <italic>Nationale</italic> in Paris before returning to London in the 1930s. By 1939, however, the Nazis shuttered this escape route, condemning the children to death like their families.\nBack in 1937, FDR appointed his cousin-in-law and extended <italic>Morgan </italic>cousin, James Peabody Houghteling, Commissioner of Immigration & Naturalization. Despite the strict immigration quotas of the <italic>Immigration Act of 1924</italic>, FDR\u2019s Administration refrained from clashing with Congress over immigration policy. While Nicholas Winton appealed to senators, FDR\u2019s wife Eleanor and Labor Secretary Frances Perkins privately supported a bill to admit 20,000 German Jewish children in 1939. \nPressuring them into staying neutral as nativist lawmakers blocked the bill, FDR\u2019s Administration restricted Jewish immigration below legal quotas, refused to admit refugees to the Virgin Islands, and rejected using Liberty ships to transport refugees. FDR\u2019s policies were shaped by political considerations and reinforced by his relationships with Jewish leaders like Rabbi Stephen Wise and UST Secretary Morgenthau, both of whom faced pressure from to suppress criticism of the Administration\u2019s inaction. Still, the only Jew in FDR\u2019s Cabinet, Morgenthau led America\u2019s aircraft program and championed military aid to Britain. \nOn the other hand, the small and predominantly Muslim Albania became a haven for Jews, if only for a few . King Zog, Europe\u2019s first and only Muslim King, began helping Jews. In 1938, after Austria\u2019s annexation by Nazi Germany, Zog issued Albanian passports to 400 Austrian Jews, including the Weitzman family, enabling them to escape Vienna. Although Zog became an exile as Italian Fascist occupied in 1939, Albania protected nearly all her Jews and hundreds of foreign refugees.\nThe looming war spurred action in France. By June 1938, MOF legislated a basis for BDF\u2019s open market operations to more promote MMMOF for MOF bonds, leading <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, and <italic>Paribas</italic> to establish a discounting house. Since his nephew marry a Goldschmidt in 1936, <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2019s Guy Bechmann saw his first cousin married a Dreyfu<italic>\u00df</italic> in 1940. Likewise, since a son of <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris\u2019 Nelson Jay married Diana Draper, a second cousin twice removed of FDR and cousin-in-law of the Langhornes, in 1936, Draper\u2019s brother married, in 1939, a Guggenheim copper heiress, reinforcing the decades-long copper kinterlink.\nNegotiating French foreign debts with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam\u2019s Mannheimer, <italic>Reynaud </italic>cousin Paul Reynaud was Finance Minister from 1938 and became PM with <italic>International League Against Antisemitism</italic>\u2019s endorsement in March 1940. While Germany forced out Jewish partners from <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Berlin, Mannheimer floated MOF debt in early 1939 from Paris out of <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam. Along with Andr\u00e9 Meyer, he tried to extend a loan to Spain\u2019s Franco in 1939. Although Kindersley advised against it per the <italic>Foreign Office</italic>, France soon pushed for the loan. As the obese Mannheimer married Jane Reiss, the daughter of a diplomat, he survived another heart attack. \nHowever, as politics deteriorated, MOF reduced the rate of interest on foreign-held debts by the spring. Mannheimer could not sell the securities, Mannheimer died after another heart attack in August. The day after, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> reported large losses on MOF debt. As <italic>Bosch</italic> claimed shares, Nazis looted <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Amsterdam and Mannheimer, pushing a narrative of fraud and suicide. Hermann Abs orchestrated the transfer of <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>\u2019s <italic>Solvay</italic> assets to <italic>Deutsche</italic>. Like with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic> bought the French <italic>Oppenheim Goldschmidt</italic> bank and <italic>Adler Oppenheim </italic>leather tannery at token prices. \nWhile Parliament subsidized <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Greek PU in 1931, SGE and GGE\u2019s Belgian PUHC continued in Brazil and Spanish America until WWII. Likewise, <italic>Hambro</italic> bought a substantial interest in <italic>Commercial Bank of Greece</italic>, which was chaired by the Governor of <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>. Since<italic> Lazard</italic> London\u2019s <italic>English Electric</italic> bought American managed AEI in 1935, competition to build Egypt\u2019s first import-substitution nitrate fertilizer factory grew. On behalf of <italic>English Electric</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Horsfall worked with the British Ambassador in 1939, but the venture failed as Britain retracted financial support. The same year, <italic>Lazard</italic> London-owner Viscount Cowdray<italic> </italic>Weetman Pearson\u2019s grandson Weetman Churchill Pearson, the third Viscount, married a cousin-in-law of Countess Hannah Rothschild Primrose.\nBulgarian banking proved more complicated. Bulgaria\u2019s alignment with Nazi Germany began with the 1932 Germano-Bulgarian clearing agreement, which intensified after Hitler\u2019s rise in 1933. King Boris III tried to balance Western European and German relations, causing uncertainty. Fearing this shift, Western capital ran. <italic>Targovska Banka </italic>struggled, as foreign trade financing moved to <italic>Banque de Cr\u00e9dit</italic>, and merchants preferred cash transactions. <italic>Bulgarian National Bank</italic> regulations further impeded its operations. \nSince 1934, efforts of <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> to merge <italic>Targovska </italic>with <italic>Franco-Belgian Bank</italic>, faced obstacles and did not materialize. By 1937, Bulgaria effectively nationalized <italic>Ipotekarna</italic>. Simultaneously, <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank </italic>merged <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Bulgare</italic> with <italic>Franco-Belgian </italic><italic>Bank</italic>. As <italic>Parisienne</italic> and SG <italic>Belge </italic>withdrew, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic>, <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>, and <italic>Irving Trust</italic> invested and reduced the Jewish element of <italic>Franco-Belgian</italic>. \nFollowing Austria\u2019s annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938, Hans Fischbock was appointed Austria\u2019s Minister of Economics in March, then Minister of Finance in May. Born in Lower Austria into a Christian family, Fischbock served in WWI, and completed his law doctorate in 1919. He then worked at <italic>Oesterreichische</italic> <italic>Allgemeine Verkehrsbank </italic>where he became a director and then joined <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> as general manager in the 1930s. He became involved in illegal Nazi circles in Vienna which allowed for his ascent from 1938.\nAs <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Abs approached <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> to acquire 25%, Fischbock sought to limit the<italic> </italic>stake to 15%. <italic>Reichsbank</italic> and <italic>German Reich Economics Ministry</italic> supported <italic>Deutsche</italic> and proposed dividing Southeast Europe, which Hungary and Yugoslavia under <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, Bulgaria and Turkey under <italic>Deutsche</italic>, and Greece under <italic>Dresdner</italic>. With the plan approved, Fischbock became Chair of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> but managed only personnel matters as <italic>Deutsche</italic> managed transactions and other activities. \nWhile selling industrial holdings to <italic>Reichswerke</italic>, including <italic>Styrian Cast Steel Works, Carinthian Iron </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Steel Works </italic><italic>Co</italic><italic>, Traisen Fine Steel Works, Steyr-Daimler-Puch, Machine </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Wagon Manufacturing, and the First Danube Steamship Co</italic>, Abs secured <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> as an industrial holding company and built holdings in paper, stone, bridge building, and foreign trade.\nSince 1933, <italic>Mercur</italic>\u2019s aryanization reduced Jewish directors from eight of eleven to two of twelve and \u201cnon-Aryan\u201d staff from 24 to 18%. Under Wilhelm Keppler, following Hitler\u2019s directive, <italic>Dresdner</italic> gained control. After the annexation, two Nazi affiliates joined the board, the last Jewish directors were expelled. <italic>Dresdner </italic>merged <italic>Mercur </italic>and <italic>Vienna L\u00e4nderbank</italic>, through which she gained control of the Polish <italic>Komercjalny</italic> and <italic>Powszechny</italic> banks, leading the Polish government to liquidate the latter. Amidst those fleeing were assimilated Jews like Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, a Katz descendant whose mother was a Nathanson and second cousin of Horace Finaly, fled to London, where he died shortly after.\nIn January 1939, GRB pressured the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister to transfer part of <italic>Czechoslovak National Bank</italic>\u2019s gold reserves to GRB. The following month,<italic> Dresdner</italic> aryanizied <italic>Bohemian Discount Bank</italic> in Prague. And in March, Germany incorporated Czechoslovakia. While seizing Czech gold,<italic> Deutsche </italic>gained control of <italic>Union Bank of Bohemia</italic><italic> </italic>with shares from taken from French and Belgian banks, and G\u00f6ring\u2019s <italic>Reichswerke </italic>and <italic>Farben</italic> integrated <italic>\u0160koda</italic>, <italic>Witkowitz</italic>, and other industries, including metallurgical and coal enterprises. \nThe Czech takeovers included Slovak operations. As a result, <italic>Bohemian Discount</italic>\u2019s Slovak partner, Arthur Franklback, resigned and was denied pension rights by <italic>Dresdner</italic>. Likewise, politically connected Slovak institutions aryanizied Jewish-owned businesses. As <italic>Slovak Creditbank</italic> acquired a<italic> </italic>brewery, <italic>Agricultural Mutual Credit Union</italic> took over L\u00f6w Beer\u2019s sugar refineries and flour mills, and <italic>Tatra Bank</italic> absorbed <italic>Lichtenstein Wil\u010dek Timber Co</italic>, <italic>Slovak Grain Co</italic>, <italic>Discounting & Economic Bank</italic>, and flour mills.\nIn the center of the country, aryanization led to the confiscation of <italic>Pick</italic> weaving mill, with its properties taken over, while Jewish residents, including the Kornfeld family, were stripped of their trades, evicted, or forced to share their homes. Like <italic>Dresdent</italic>, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> took over <italic>Czech-Moravian Bank</italic> and seized Jewish properties, reallocating them to Aryans. Like elsewhere, authorities blocked Jewish bank accounts with a monthly withdrawal limit.\nSince Germany occupied Prague in March 1939, forcing <italic>Vickers</italic> to exit, France and Britain guaranteed Polish and Romanian independence. But as Hitler and Stalin allied and invaded Poland in September, <italic>Reichswerke</italic> took control of Polish state-owned mines with relative ease for use by <italic>Farben</italic>. Opening sub-branches in Bielsko, Cieszyn, Bogumin, Lodz, Poznan, and Krakow, <italic>Deutsche</italic> faced competition from <italic>Dresdner</italic>, <italic>Commerz</italic>, and <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>. \nEstablishing <italic>Polish Bank of Emission</italic> as a <italic>zloty</italic> issuing monopoly, German officials reversed Poland\u2019s earlier liquidation and restored <italic>Bank Komercjalny</italic> as <italic>Dresdner</italic>\u2019s agent. <italic>Deutsche</italic> sought to acquire <italic>Schlesische</italic> in Breslau and <italic>Handlowy</italic> in Warsaw\u2014Poland\u2019s largest bank,<italic> </italic>controlled by <italic>British Overseas Bank</italic>\u2019s <italic>Anglo-Polish Bank</italic>\u2014but both attempts failed. While Poland defaulted on her debts, <italic>Lazard</italic> London used on hand funds to pay interest. \nLikewise, Soviet forces seized Polish oil assets nearly entirely held by the French. By December, Stalin invaded Finland. The Finnish ambassador in Washington contacted <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Lewis Strauss-Darmstadt. While Strauss worked with Ben Cohen of the New Deal to provide aid through the U.S. Export-Import Bank, <italic>Cravath</italic>\u2019s Donald Swatland established <italic>Finnish-American Trading Corp</italic>. Eric Warburg became chief of the corporation and oversaw shipments of <italic>Ford</italic> trucks, Idaho peas, and fighter planes across the Baltic Sea.\nIn May 1940, America seized <italic>Union Banking Corp</italic>, the New York collaboration between <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic> and Fritz Thyssen for financing the Nazis. Under threat of being sent to death camps themselves, executives at the <italic>Deutsche-</italic>banked<italic> Farben</italic> and other enterprises forced labor in German territories, particularly coal mining. Along with creating synthetic oil, rubber, and pest control gases, the mostly <italic>Nazi</italic>-led <italic>Farben</italic> assisted in construction death camps and using gases in industrial scale murder. In 1941, <italic>Farben</italic> joined <italic>Merck Finck</italic> to seize an Austrian magnesite mining firm from the estate of Emil Winter, a deceased Pittsburgh industrialist.\nWhile Vienna relied on east-west main lines for Silesian coal before <italic>Versailles</italic> and could not afford to develop hydroelectricity after. As <italic>Reichswerke</italic> developed Austrian lines, she oriented them north-south. By late 1940, G\u00f6ring established <italic>Kontinentale </italic>as an HC for Austrian, French, and Dutch petroleum securities. Felix Warburg died in 1940, his relatives fled as the Nazi\u2019s nationalized <italic>Warburg</italic> in Hamburg and Amsterdam within months and renamed her <italic>Brinckmann Wirtz</italic>. \nDuring the Nazi occupation, <italic>Reichswerke</italic> reoriented Belgian electricity to military. Under Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain\u2019s collaborationist Vichy regime, Jews were denied political rights for the first time since 1789 in July 1940. Since the Nazis confiscated the old <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt and imprisoned Louis Rothschild of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna for a year until receiving a record ransom amidst Hitler\u2019s continued to blame Jewish international bankers, the family dissolved <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and Edward Rothschild and others fled to New York in July. While <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Pierre joined the <italic>Free</italic> <italic>French Army</italic>, his father, Andr\u00e9 Meyer, the Wertheims, and others moved to Lyon before fleeing to New York and London. \nWhile <italic>Citi</italic> and most Anglo-American banks closed their Paris operations following the German occupation of France, Nelson Jay and the Carters of <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris fled to America but, like <italic>Rockefeller</italic>\u2019s <italic>Chase </italic>Paris, retained a presence. <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris came under the leadership of Maurice Didion, who operated under Nazi control. Although assets form their Jewish accounts were seized, Didion blocked Nazi deposits and refused to release MOF bills.\nAlthough former <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris partner Raymond Philippe moved his fund\u2019s assets to the Americas, he stayed in France to protect his son Pierre, a French soldier. Both were arrested and interred in 1942. Philippe died in custody in 1943, while Pierre escaped to America and revived the family fund. But Nazis forbade even elite Jews were forbidden from leaving. While Pierre Weill fled to America, his wife Berthe Haardt Weill and their children were blocked from leaving France and went into hiding. They used the alias \u2018Wattel\u2019 and stayed with Countess Villy in Aveyron, renting Chateau B\u00e9duer from 1943 to 1945. Pierre\u2019s son Michel, born in 1932, and his sister were baptized as Catholics to avoid detection. Michel\u2019s half-brother, Jean Gaillard, was captured and died in concentration camps due to his resistance work.\nSince a law in July 1940 deprived those leaving France without official orders of citizenship, and liquidated the assets of 446 people, including General Charles Gaulle, the Rothschild family, and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Andr\u00e9 Meyer. Another law in August began aryanization and administrators were appointed to Jewish firms and shares soon after. Likewise, <italic>Paribas</italic> Director Paul Thomasson administered <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris until <italic>Devisenschutzkommando </italic>took over <italic>Lazard </italic>Paris<italic>\u2019</italic> office to control FX.\nIn September 1940, the Reich Economics Ministry instructed German banks to invest in Dutch, Belgian, and French businesses and acquire foreign companies operating in the Balkans. <italic>Deutsche</italic> operated in annexed Alsace-Lorraine under her own name, opening branches in Strasbourg, Mulhouse, Thionville, and Metz, and took over <italic>Industriel</italic>. She maintained Brussels, Luxembourg, and Paris offices to manage acquisitions, focusing on <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Parisienne</italic>. As in other countries, the Nazis looted extensive art collections from French Jewish bankers and families, including the Rothschild, Lazard, Rheims, Silny, Erlanger, Oppenheim, and Dreyfu\u00df families. \nFearing that aryanization would lead to Germany control, French buyers of Jewish assets profited from aryanization instead, especially as they were forced to curtail international activities. While Gunzburg-in-laws <italic>Louis-Hirsch</italic> and other banks were liquidated, France confiscated <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris. After Marcel Bloch-Dassault denied being made an honorary Aryan to make warplanes, he was forced into hiding and later arrested.Since the Christian Ren\u00e9 Fillon\u2014Guy Rothschild\u2019s former tutor\u2014joined <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris in 1932 as a Department Head, he became Attorney-in-Fact in 1940, with a reduced staff in the former Vichy zone. While Lazard-in-law Pierre Wertheim and his brother found an Aryan proxy to run <italic>Chanel</italic> and keep Coco Chanel at bay.<italic> </italic>\nJacques-Edouard Mallet Vernes\u2014whose brother had married a Deutsch-Meurthe Goldschmidt in 1923\u2014participated in as the liquidator of <italic>Stern</italic>, <italic>Rueff</italic>, and <italic>Heine</italic> banks. An investigation by the Gironde prefecture suspected him in 1941 of favoring Jewish interests.<italic> </italic>Swiss Aubert and the French industrialist Harlachol ran the entire <italic>Galeries Lafayette</italic> as executives Raoul Meyer and Max Heilbronner and over a hundred other employees were dismissed. Meyer sought refuge in unoccupied France, while Heilbronner joined the French resistance and was later arrested by the Gestapo and then deported to Buchenwald. Th\u00e9ophile Bader died in 1942.\nWhile Hypolite Worms had headed the French delegation in London through 1939, <italic>Worms</italic> fell under German control in 1940. Olivier Seze and German commissioner Beines Ziegesar gained control, but Hypolite\u2014born to a Christian mother and baptized\u2014remained at the head of the bank in Paris and, with colleagues, helped branch to Marseilles and Algiers. Heavily criticized by both sides, he remained alone as his Jewish partner Goudchaux resigned and Christian partner Barnaud accepted official duties. <italic>Worms</italic> carried out financial operations including capital increases, board memberships, bond issues, and stock exchange listings.\nAlong with <italic>L\u00e9vy</italic> and<italic> Banque d\u2019Escompte</italic> banks, other aryanized enterprises included the <italic>Tribune R\u00e9publicaine</italic> and<italic> Mot d\u2019Ordre of Marseille</italic> newspapers, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Gazo-Industrie</italic>, <italic>Bloch-Dassault Aviation</italic>, and <italic>Etablissements Sudarski</italic> chain stores. As<italic> </italic><italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic> seized control of <italic>Galeries Lafayette</italic> (having had a relationship with the company\u2019s founder Th\u00e9ophile Bader since 1896), <italic>Credit Industriel</italic> took over <italic>Transatlantique Bank</italic>. <italic>Paribas</italic> executives collaborated with Nazis, while top bank managers, including Henri Ardant of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and Hugues J\u00e9quier of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Commercial</italic>, actively engaging in Parisian life alongside the Nazis. Still, Ardant concealed some requisitioned employees. \nStill, German investors acquired SG <italic>Belge</italic>-affiliated <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Financi\u00e8re pour l\u2019Etranger </italic>(which held <italic>Sino-Belge Bank</italic>), then owned by Bulgarian Jew Angel Kuyumdji. Facing liquidation, <italic>l\u2019Etrange </italic>was taken over by the aryanized <italic>Union Financi\u00e8re de Paris</italic>. Renamed <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Cr\u00e9dits et d\u2019Investissements</italic>, her capital surged from 1 to 25 million <italic>francs</italic>. This entity facilitated German investors to purchase department store <italic>Galeries Lafayette</italic>, a contentious acquisition opposed by French authorities. \nGerman troops reached <italic>Wendel</italic> iron works in Lorraine in June 1940. In July, the Wendels obtained authorization from Hermann G\u00f6ring to manage <italic>Wendel</italic>, but German authorities expelled them along with all non-Lorraine French personnel. The Vichy regime dissolved the Wendel-led <italic>Comit\u00e9 des Forges</italic> iron cartel in November 1940, installing industry committees, including the steel and fuel <italic>Comit\u00e9s</italic>\u2014to centralize production, pricing, and distribution under state authority\u2014with the latter chaired by Jules Aubrun, connected to <italic>Schneider</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. In 1941, Germany incorporated the Hayange works into G\u00f6ring\u2019s state-owned <italic>Reichswerke</italic>.\nOstensibly to retain French police autonomy, Chief of Police Ren\u00e9 Bousquet sent hundreds of Jews to their deaths. Budget Director Jean Jardel and <italic> Indochine</italic>\u2019s pre-war General Manager Paul Baudouin also served in high positions under P\u00e9tain. In British Egypt, <italic>Lyonnais</italic> director Jean Morin refused to join the Gaullists, was detained by British authorities, and forced into retirement by BOE. \nOther bankers supported the Resistance. <italic>Paribas</italic> President since 1931, \u00c9mile Moreau refused German financial demands and was forced to resign in 1941, ceding the presidency to Laurent-Atthalin. Olivier Moreau-N\u00e9ret became <italic>Ministry of Finance</italic> Secretary General for Economic Affairs in 1940, resigned after disputing German claims in Syria in 1941, returned to <italic>Lyonnais</italic> in the Free Zone. Likewise, Jacques Fouchier, chief of staff to Laval\u2019s <italic>Ministry of Finance</italic> in 1942, resigned after Laval\u2019s speech favoring German victory and joined the Free French army. \nHero of the Resistance, General Charles Gaulle\u2019s mother descended from the northern industrial Kolb-Bernard family. The Resistance included the two heads of <italic>Parisienne</italic> Lyon in the Free Zone were\u2014including General Gaulle\u2019s brother Pierre who entered <italic>Parisienne</italic> after WWI \u2014who were arrested by the Gestapo but survived. <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> Deputy Managing Director Bernard Brezet left France to join Free France and died in combat in Italy. While <italic>Parisienne</italic> executive Martial Tricaud had four sons who fought for Free France or the Resistance, <italic>Parisienne</italic> paid a million <italic>francs</italic> to the Resistance, and <italic>Lyonnais</italic> President Brincard authorized sixty million <italic>francs</italic> in Lyon for Henri Lumi\u00e8re, of which a third financed the Resistance. A son of <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Jean Bloch-Lain\u00e9, Fran\u00e7ois Some raised funds for the Resistance and received subsidies from bankers.\nLikewise, the Germans suspected <italic>Lyonnais</italic> co-Managing Director \u00c9douard Escarra because his brother had joined General Gaulle in London. <italic>Indochine</italic> Deputy Managing Director Jean Laurent, Gaulle\u2019s former aide, managed operations from Vichy and Marseille, was arrested in 1944. <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Andr\u00e9 Debray organized clandestine Resistance financing inside the bank, fought in Paris in 1944.\nNor were French Christians safe. Amidst the crisis, antisemitic attacked Ernest Mercier for his marriage to a Jew and falsely linked his rise to the Rothschilds. Mercier stepped down from <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles</italic> in 1940 and narrowly avoided Gestapo arrest in 1943. The son of a Catholic banker of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Lyonnaise de D\u00e9p\u00f4ts</italic> and a friend of the Schlumbergers, Jean Riboud joined the resistance before the Nazis imprisoned him  Buchenwald from 1943. \nLikewise, former French PM Albert Sarraut was deported by the Nazis, while his brother Maurice was assassinated in 1943. Sarraut\u2019s son-in-law and <italic>Indochine</italic> banker Jean Sainteny became supported General Gaulle\u2019s Resistance. Other French Christians disrupted German progress outside of France. Since shifting focus on Romania, oil servicer <italic>Schlumberger</italic> fled the country as Germany invaded in 1940. Before returning to France, they sabotaged railway cars transporting oil to disrupt German progress.\nSince <italic>Lehideux</italic> banker and <italic>Paribas</italic> cousin Fran\u00e7ois Lehideux married into the <italic>Renault </italic>family, he became one of Marshall Philippe Petain\u2019s most ardent supporters. In October 1940, he became Director of the Organization Committee of Automobile & Cycle. In July 1941, he was appointed Secretary of State for Industrial Production under the Vichy regime, where he was responsible for coordinating French industry and Nazi Germany. Along with managing <italic>Renault</italic>\u2019s parts and services for German military vehicles, he oversaw the production of materials and resources for the German war effort. <italic>Lazard</italic> London remained in control of France\u2019s largest cement maker <italic>Poliet Chausson</italic> since 1932 until <italic>Parisienne</italic> replaced her in 1942.\nFrom 1938, European refugees began fleeing wherever they could. America welcomed some of the fortunate. As James Speyer retired, <italic>Speyer</italic> New York liquidated in 1939,<italic> </italic>and the remaining partners\u2014including James Speyer\u2019s nephew Herbert Beit Speyer, Herbert\u2019s cousin-in-law Otto Neufville, and Speyer\u2019s 1934 hire, George Lindsay\u2014organized <italic>Swiss American Corp</italic> in New York<italic> </italic>with capital from <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>. While Lindsay became President, Daniel Norton, the American-born President of <italic>Nestl\u00e9 </italic>America, became Chair. After France fell in 1940, <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic> and the Fribourg family\u2019s <italic>Continental Grain </italic>relocated their headquarters from Paris to New York. While <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris executives resumed work at <italic>Lazard</italic> New York, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris did not.\nSince fleeing to America, Hamburg-born Eric Warburg\u2014who served for German during WWI\u2014served as a lieutenant colonel in America\u2019s Army. Donating cigarettes to French and British troops, Jewish Bulgarian banker Angel Kuyumdji soon fled to America. His ties with Bulgarian leaders made him an asset to American intelligence. While Guy Halphen Rothschild moved his wife and child from Paris to New York, he went to Britain, joined the French Resistance, and fought to liberate France. Likewise, Guy\u2019s second cousin, Philippe Meurthe Gunzburg, fought in France while his parents sheltered in America. \nMany industrial and financier families fled to the Americas, mostly to the Jewish Metropolis of New York, where they became leaders in exile. Among Austrian exiles were industrialists Ferdinand Bloch Bauer, E.G. Pick, Leo Blum, Leo Haas. Other leading bankers included Louis Rothschild (former President of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>), Alex Weiner (VP of <italic>Wiener</italic> and later <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>), and Herman Oppenheim of <italic>Austrian National Bank</italic>. Having fled from Belgium to New York, 95% of the Belgian diamond traders organized into a trade club to vend diamonds cut in Jewish Palestine. French exiles included industrialists Pierre Dreyfu\u00df (son of Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df) and Baron Pierre Gunzburg, as well as financiers Baron Edouard Rothschild, and <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Horace Finaly. \nHungarian business leaders in exile included Berthold Magyar, Albert Ungar, Henry Fleischman, and George Popper (textile industrialists), Alex and Siegfried Linderbaum (oil industry), and Joseph Schober (textile industry). While many remained in Greece, those who escaped before the invasion included Peppo Mallah (industrialist, former Minister of Finance), industrialist Fernandes, banker <italic>Amar</italic>, industrialists <italic>Allatani</italic>, and banker Albert Matarasso, most settling in France. From Poland, industrialists Karl Sachs (sugar) along with Warsaw private banker Rafael Szereszowski, who had been allowed to operate one of the two banks in the Warsaw ghetto, along with the Eitingon family\u2019s <italic>Lo</italic><italic>dzki Bank</italic>.\nThose who fled faced sacrifices too. Long Rothschilds\u2019 neighbors in Frankfurt, the Sterns established <italic>Stern </italic>in 1823 to cater to French aristocracy. After Alice Goldschmidt Stern fled Paris with her children and took a job as a <italic>Bergdorf Goodman</italic> saleswoman in New York. Since Henry May left his <italic>Saenger</italic> textile shop in Heilbronn, he moved to New York and worked as a union laborer while his siblings perished in concentration camps. \nOther bankers and heirs served in government. <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 Rene Mayer served in London as head of the Ministry of Munitions and director of the Inter-Allied Executive Committee for Munitions & Raw Materials and later as Secretary of Communications in General Henry Giraud\u2019s provisional government. From 1939, <italic>Mallet</italic> cousin-in-law and international \u2018Money Doctor\u2019 of the 1920s, Edward Young was Chair of London\u2019s Capital Issues Committee, which administered the control of investment throughout the economy. He also chaired the joint committees of the Treasury and the Ministry of Labour which administered the exemption from military service.\nSince Sybil Smyth Hambro managed female staff and ran the secretarial sections within British Secret Service during WWI, her son, Charles Hambro, commissioned as a colonel joined Special Operations Executive after the fall of France. He became Executive Chief from 1941 before refocusing on Raw Materials. Since establishing MI-6 during WWI, Britain formed <italic>Special Operations Executive</italic> in 1940 to assist guerrilla movements in the war against Hitler, with members including John Stevens, a son-in-law of <italic>Westminster Bank</italic> director Chris Hely-Hutchinson, an in-law of Baring cousins; <italic>Jardine</italic> cousin William Keswick; and extended <italic>Rothschild</italic> cousin Richard Gibson, born to a Christian  father and an ennobled mother descended from Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister and Joseph Goldschmidt.\nAs Victor Wertheim Rothschild of Rothschild <italic>London</italic> spent WWII in charge of MI-5\u2019s counter-sabotage section, he worked with Katherine Meinertzhagen Mayor, whose uncle Richard had worked in British Army intelligence during WWI and uncle Daniel worked with <italic>Lazard</italic> London. <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Adam Marris served as Counsellor at the British Embassy in DC from, contributing to diplomacy. Since fleeing Nazi Germany for France, former German Minister of Finance Rudolf Hilferding was arrested by Vichy police in unoccupied France and transported to occupied Paris, where he was killed in 1941. \nDescended from French, German, and Italian nobility, the long-converted Erlanger family also fused their interests with those of the Rothschilds and other capitalists for British security. Following the report of a committee chaired by <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic>\u2019s John Cadman, <italic>British Airways</italic> and <italic>Imperial Airways</italic> merged to create <italic>British Overseas Airways Corp</italic>, strengthening the government\u2019s role in civil aviation. Along with serving as a director of the new airline, Gerard Erlanger developed <italic>Air Transport Auxiliary</italic> in 1940, while his cousin Leo Erlanger became a director of <italic>Erlanger</italic> in 1939 and Chair soon after.\nSoon, along with millions of other Jews and other ethnic minorities and political rivals of the Nazis, Christian Lazard\u2014who had resigned from <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in protest of rescuing <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic><italic> </italic>in 1930\u2014as well as partner and cousin Robert Lazard and heirs of Camondo, Goldschmidt, Lieben, Polyakov, Morpurgo, Warshavsky, Louri\u00e9, Ulman, and thousands of their Katz extended cousins across Europe were murdered. Some could have left but continued about their lives due to stubbornness or hope. While several Cah\u00e9n heiresses joined the resistance, many were arrested and deported to Auschwitz. Colette, together with her husband Armand, was active in the French Underground until being arrested. While Armand died in a concentration camp, Colette escaped deportation and rejoined the resistance.\nSince the Reich Economics Ministry instructed German banks to invest in Dutch, Belgian, and French businesses in September 1940, <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Abs declined the takeover of <italic>Rotterdam Bank</italic>, as he sat on the board of her Dutch subsidiary <italic>Bary Michaelis</italic>. In Belgium, <italic>Dresdner</italic> attempted to gain control over SG <italic>Belge</italic> since acquiring <italic>Zivnostenka Bank</italic> in Prague with interests in heavy industry and ambitions to control <italic>Solvay</italic>. SG <italic>B</italic><italic>elge</italic> chose to collaborate and sell her shares to <italic>Deutsche</italic> instead<italic> General Bank of Luxembourg</italic>, <italic>Albania</italic><italic>n</italic><italic> </italic><italic>National Bank</italic>,<italic> </italic><italic>Mortgage Bank for Bosnia</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Herzegovina </italic>in Sarajevo, and others. \n<italic>Philippson Horowitz</italic> aryanized as <italic>Degroof</italic>. While the Lamberts had transferred their wealth to America and moved their offices to London, Nazi authorities entered the Belgian operations through sequestration in 1940. <italic>Cassel</italic> of Brussels, however, was dissolved in 1943, with L\u00e9on Cassel\u2019s only son having fled to America.\nAs Dutch aryanization policies forced <italic>Mendes Gans</italic>\u2019 Jewish partners to relinquish their share, Christian directors renamed the bank <italic>Dutch Banking House</italic>. <italic>Lissa Kann</italic> of the Hague entered a close association with the Christian <italic>Mees</italic> and <italic>Hope</italic> in Amsterdam, which practically took her over and ended four centuries of banking. Some Sephardic families, including the Mendes and Teixeira, claimed descent from Old Christian, Iberian aristocracy to successfully evade anti-Jewish measures. Non-noble cousins were less fortunate. \nDespite having been baptized and marrying a fellow convert, <italic>Dresdner</italic> heir Fritz Magnez Guttman of Amsterdam\u2019s <italic>Proehl Guttman </italic>obtained a permit to go to Italy, but Nazi governor Arthur Seyss-Inquart demanded he transfer all his property to the Reich. Guttman refused, and was deported with his wife to separate camps and murdered. \nLikewise, as <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Jewish partners were forced out and Paul Cahn Daniels May committed suicide, <italic>Rhodius</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Koenigs</italic>\u2019 Alfred Flesche took control and reoriented <italic>KLM Royal Dutch </italic><italic>Airways</italic> and other engineering for warfare. Like in other occupied lands, Nazis looted museums and private art collections, building their hoard of gold and precious stones by taking over traders in Amsterdam. By 1941, Hitler\u2019s <italic>verordnung </italic>ordered Jews to deposit securities and money into <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>, as they deported them to death camps, but most lost trust due to looting. \nGerman banks expanded with shares taken from French and Belgian banks. While <italic>Deutsche</italic> retained her hod on <italic>Banque de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> in Bulgaria, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> grew her interests in <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic> and expanded into Romania and Bulgaria. Along with acquiring <italic>Romanian Commercial Bank</italic><italic> </italic>via expropriated shares, <italic>Deutsche</italic> financed Romanian oil fields with <italic>Kontinentale</italic>. <italic>Deutsche</italic> secured a major stake in <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, establishing a joint-stock company for lignite extraction by 1941 to engage local majority participations. Acquiring <italic>General Yugoslav Bank</italic>, Abs sought to retain Belgian <italic>Solvay</italic> as investors, but was overruled.\nIn March 1941, Serbian General Dusan Simovic led a coup that removed Yugoslavia\u2019s pro-German government. This triggered invasion by Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Bulgaria, resulting in Yugoslavia\u2019s surrender on April 17 of that year. That month, President FDR blocked Yugoslav assets with an executive order, including gold at FRS <italic>New York</italic> and other private assets for the Yugoslav Government-in-exile. Germany occupied Serbia, northern Slovenia, and the Banat; Hungary annexed Vojvodina; Bulgaria took Macedonia; and Italy controlled Dalmatia. \nYugoslavia\u2019s remaining territories were reorganized into Croatia under Ante Pavelic. Serbian Jews were heavily persecuted, murdering heirs of <italic>Haim</italic>, <italic>Zander</italic>, and numerous others from 1941. By September, Nazis and their collaborators targeted Eishyshok, a nine-century-old shtetl outside of Wilna, Lithuania, murdering 5,000 Jews. Nazi forces similarly razed 20,000 other shtetls. \nWhile London-trained Marcus Wallenberg Jr was pro-Allied, his Swiss-trained brother Jacob was pro-German. In 1941, Hitler appointed Jacob \u2018<italic>Knight Commander of the Order of the German Eagle</italic>,\u2019 a recognition he established in 1937 for foreigners who had served the Third Reich. Jacob held <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>\u2019s managing directorship since 1927 until transferred it to Marcus under Allied pressure after the war. Since Wallenberg\u2019s <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> and Philipson\u2019s <italic>Svenska Handelsbank</italic> gained <italic>Kreuger </italic>assets, including match monopoly-backed interest payments from Germany, which continued paying through the war. \nAs Otto Wolff\u2014a Christian co-founder of <italic>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</italic>\u2014bought GRS loans to reduce foreign debt, Jacob Wallenberg sold <italic>Kreuger</italic> debt to <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Abs at a 40% discount. This exchange allowed Germany to use its FX and gold reserves to offset her debts, with Wolff paying Abs a commission on behalf of Friedrich Kadgien.Although Sweden remained neutral, Warburg cousin and Colonel Axel Philipson was the first Jew to join the military nobility in 1940. \n<italic>Reichswerke</italic>\u2019s G\u00f6ring had depended on Friedrich Kadgien for FX. After studying law, Kadgien entered public service in 1930 and joined the Nazi party in 1932. In 1934 he began work in Ministry of Economics on FX and gained Hitler\u2019s approval. <italic>Kreuger</italic> and other transfers between investors and GRB\u2019s looted gold were intermediated by BIS. Thomas McKittrick, of <italic>Kreuger</italic>\u2019s former banker <italic>Lee Higginson </italic>London, served on BIS\u2019 German Credits Arbitration Committee from 1931 and became President of BIS in 1940. \nWhile most Jews had fled from Belgium, Kadgien began confiscating diamonds from the Christian diamond dealers of Antwerp for FX. Among the purchasers was Werner Clemm. The son of a German baron, Clemm had married a daughter of Harry Green, who had led <italic>International Banking Corp</italic> before acquisition by <italic>Citi</italic> and then served as VP until retiring in 1931. In 1942, Clemm was convicted of conspiring to raise funds for the German High Command by selling diamonds seized in Belgium and the Netherlands as Green died in German occupied Guernsey. \nAfter the Nazis invaded the neutral Dutch in May 1940, Japan sought to control coal prices and distribution through a coal control association dominated by zaibatsu interests. Although attempts were made to remove the commercial rights of wholesalers, domestic coal production remained constant. \nBy the time Germany and France signed an armistice in June, the Soviet Union annexed Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania by deploying troops, staging elections, and installing puppet parliaments that voted for incorporation and nationalizing all banks and credit institutions. As part of the process, she deported merchants and bankers to Siberia, including <italic>Merchants Bank of Libau</italic>\u2019s Hermann Epstein, where he died soon after. That month, Serge Obolensky\u2019s second cousin once removed of New York married North Carolina manufacturer David Morg\u2014an extended cousin-in-law of the Morgans\u2014whose daughter married a Smyth descendant, who had worked at <italic>Morgan</italic> in New York from 1930 until joining New York bank <italic>Spencer Trask</italic> in London in 1936.\nAs Hitler signed a pact with Mussolini, and Japan in September to split territories, Stalin demanded Bulgaria as a buffer to enter the pact. After Germany formed a pact with Bulgaria and invaded Britain in the Spring of 1941, Japan invaded Hong Kong and seized HSBC and <italic>Chartered Bank</italic> to access Indonesia\u2019s resources. \nUnder Marshal P\u00e9tain, Vichy France spread Nazi ideology across French territory. In Algeria, they revoked benefits for Muslim, and after legalizing antisemitism, abolished the Algerian Jews\u2019 naturalization right granted in 1870. As Britain occupied Libya and invaded Iraq in 1940, <italic>Morgan </italic>New York and <italic>Morgan Grenfell </italic>transferred gold they held at the Vatican into America. Since the death of Italian Libya\u2019s Governor Balbo that year, Benghazi Jews saw British capture as liberation. \nBut with British withdrawal, Jews with French passports were expelled to German-occupied Tunisia, and thousands of Libyan Jews perished in European death camps or desert internment camps. By 1941, Hitler allied with Commander of the Holy Jihad Amin Husayni of Jerusalem and his ally, anti-British Iraqi PM Rashid Gaylani, who overthrew the regime and refused to allow British troops to pass. Exiled to Germany, Gaylani fueled a pogrom against Baghdadi Jews, forcing the Zilkha family to flee to America.\nTo protect her flank, Japan attacked America\u2019s naval base in Hawaii. This attack drew America into the war and led FDR to provide support to the Allies, including the bombing of Indonesian oil infrastructure. As an Ambassador to Japan since the 1930s, John Morgan Jr\u2019s cousin-in-law Joseph Grew was interned by Japan for half a year. \nWhile imprisoning <italic>Sassoon</italic> cousins <italic>Kadoorie</italic>, the Japanese took over their hotels as headquarters. Having worked at <italic>Jardine</italic> Shanghai and chaired the municipal council in 1938, William Keswick survived a Japanese assassination attempt in 1941. He entered wartime service that year in Singapore and later headed Britain\u2019s wartime secret service, <italic>Special Operations Executive</italic>, in China. \nFrom 1942, Japan rationalized and systematized wartime transportation of Korean and Chinese sex and coal slaves. With the loss of her Far East colonies, Britain purchased all of Nigeria\u2019s cocoa, palm oil, rubber, cotton, and groundnut production, shifting from a neutral economic stance to controlling transportation, prices, wages, and export crop marketing.\nAlthough Spain remained neutral, FX shortages led Franco to impose import controls and establish coal quotas from 1941. By June of that year, Hitler broke his pact with Stalin and invaded the Soviet Union with Romanian forces, exterminating Jews in the traditional <italic>Pale</italic> as <italic>Reichswerke</italic> targeted commodities from the Urals, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Bukhara, which Stalin checked by destroying infrastructure in retreat. But while some ethnic Ukrainians and Romanians coordinated Jewish genocide, Stalin resettled Jewish women and children in Central Asia, soon establishing factories in Samarkand. \nMany who remained, including the family of <italic>Merchants Bank of Libau</italic>\u2019s Hermann Epstein, were executed by the Nazis. After the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, <italic>Deutsche</italic> gained precedence in Lemberg and Riga, while expansion in other annexed areas was restricted. <italic>Deutsche</italic> participated indirectly in Soviet oil exploitation via <italic>Kontinentale</italic>.\nSince <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York formed <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> <italic>Rockefeller</italic> in 1936 and added <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Allen Dulles as a director the following year, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> London expanded her presence to America, handling UST bonds and leveraging prewar German connections to provide intelligence to America. While most Anglo-American banks closed their Paris operations following the German occupation of France, <italic>Rockefeller</italic>-controlled <italic>Chase </italic>Paris remained open. Managed by Swiss Carlos Niedermann, the branch actively collaborated with Nazi authorities. \nIn May 1942, five months after America entered the war, Niedermann reported that the bank enjoyed \u201cvery special esteem\u201d among German officials and continued to manage German government and embassy accounts. Despite being aware of this collaboration, <italic>Chase </italic>New York headquarters chose not to remove Niedermann. Subsequent investigations by UST and FRS concluded that <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s activities supported the Nazi regime.\nSince Bolivia nationalized <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s assets, America\u2019s State Department pressured Bolivia to limit German influence in its oil and tin industries. As America\u2019s RFC loans supported supply, Bolivia\u2019s <italic>Revolutionary Nationalist Movement</italic> formed in 1942 to represent working-class and indigenous interests, but they did not win. But as Juan Peron led Argentina\u2019s military to a coup in 1943, he expropriated SGE\u2019s PUs and IT&T\u2019s telephony.\nPerhaps one of the strongest signs that antisemitism was pushed by the Nazis, Denmark had protected her Jewry since Germany occupied her in 1940. Only, the resignation of the Danish government in 1943 marked a turning point, and, amidst advance notice of deportations, Copenhagen banker and Warburg-cousin Carl Henriques funded the mass evacuation of Jews and political refugees with Danish resistance contacts into Sweden. \nBy then, Germany executed two <italic>Deutsche</italic> directors for \u2018defeatist\u2019 attitudes. Engaged in resistance and providing vital information on Germany\u2019s conditions through Jacob and Marcus Wallenberg, Helmuth Moltke and Carl Goerdeler became involved in the 1944 \u2018July Plot\u2019, seeking to assassinate Hitler and take charge as chancellor. During a meeting where a German officer planted a bomb, the explosion wounded Hitler and caused casualties among his men. \nMoltke and Goerdeler were executed by the Nazis by 1945. While Goerdeler\u2019s family was imprisoned, his son became an accountant and later became the \u2018G\u2019 in KPMG. Moltke\u2019s grandson, many years later, became CFO of <italic>Deutsche</italic>. Likewise, the Gestapo targeted partners of the former <italic>Oppenheim</italic>. Robert Pferdmenges, warned of his arrest, fled but was later captured by, held under house arrest, and released several months later. While his brother, Friedrich Oppenheim, was imprisoned, Waldemar escaped to hide with his family for the remainder of the war. \nWhile Austrian Count Ferdinand Oppenheim Arco was imprisoned in a concentration camp, his in-law, Wallenberg cousin, diplomat Raoul joined neutral countries in supporting Zionist youths to save tens of thousands of lives, slowing Germany\u2019s aim of quick deportations in 1944. Issuing similar immigration certificates to the Palestine Office, Raoul saved up to 9,000 Jews flee Hungary before disappearing in Soviet detention under suspicion of espionage. \nAfter being arrested for \u2018anti-national activities\u2019 in 1941, the Chief Rabbi of Bratislava\u2019s niece Edith Katz escaped from a camp in 1944, and led a Slovak Partisan brigade detachment, ultimately covering her comrades\u2019 retreat with a machine-gun before being shot. And in 1943, Jewish resistance fighters revolted against the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto armed with homemade weapons. Though brutally suppressed, they outlasted some countries.\nIn Hungary, <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>converted Gy\u00f6rgy Ulman opposed Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and was linked to the resistance. By 1945, he fled Hungary. His third cousin twice removed, a Catholic descendant of Moritz Ulman, Tibor Scitovszky became Chair of <italic>Creditbank</italic> from 1944. While many of the ennobled descendants of <italic>Creditbank</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>leadership were converted financial and industrial leaders, most joined other affluent Jewish families in signing over their assets for a minority interest and secured safe passage out of Hungary, including those of <italic>Creditbank</italic>\u2019s former President Zsigmond Kornfeld. \nThis presented an opportunity for Tivadar Schwartz\u2014a non-observant great-grandson of an Ulman\u2014de-Judaized his surname to Soros and arranged for his son, George, to hide as a Lutheran to survive the war. George pretended to be the son of a Lutheran sympathizer who was hiding his Jewish wife. At one point, George accompanied his caretaker to appraise a Kornfeld estate. Tivadar moved George after a former classmate recognized him. \nWhile banker Baron Ulman concealed himself for 8 months in an attic cupboard of his Christian barber, Rothschild-in-law Johanna Wertheim had escaped captivity, only to be arrested in Budapest in 1944 and held for deportation to a death camp. She managed to evade capture by feigning her own suicide, then sought refuge in a cellar, narrowly avoiding execution by the advancing Soviet forces. Most were less fortunate. While a Cahn-Stern fled Frankfurt for Holland in 1933 to start a business, he hid during the war before much of his family perished, including his young daughter, Anne Frank. \nAs America entered the war, UST Secretary Morgenthau spearheaded the war bond program, largely bypassing Wall Street and relying on patriotism. Still, FDR\u2019s Administration avoided significant action to help Jews. Despite American planes bombing targets near Auschwitz, pleas to bomb the railways leading to the camp were rejected.  Not until discovering the State Department\u2019s obstruction of aid in 1944 did Morgenthau push FDR to create <italic>War Refugee Board</italic> to establish safe havens for Jews and other victims.\nHowever, after the German Nazis replaced Italian Fascist occupation forces in late 1943, Albania managed to save nearly all her 200 native Jews and hundreds of refugees. Rafael Jakoel, who had been trading with Italy, sought refuge from the mayor of Vlora, who assured him of safety. However, due to the escalating danger, Jakoel and his family relocated to Tirana and met with Interior Minister Xhafer Deva. \nAlthough Deva collaborated with the Nazis, he refused to provide the Germans with a list of Jews and assured Jakoel that they would remain unharmed while he was in power. Jakoel\u2019s family was then hidden in the home of Vlora\u2019s vice mayor and later moved to Kavaje, where they hid in gardens and using safe houses. In Kosovo, Arif Alickaj, a Muslim municipal official in Decan, issued false identification papers to Jewish refugees from Macedonia and Serbia, allowing them to escape Nazi detection. Similarly, Arsllan Rezniqi, a grocer from Decan, used his truck to transport around 400 Jewish refugees across the border from Macedonia into Albania, where they were hidden in his garden and local homes amidst constant Nazi patrols. \nReligious and non-religious authoritie also aided Jews in converting to Christianity or Islam with unusual ease. Unlike in other European countries, where conversions required formal catechism and high-level approval, in Albania, these conversions were quick and widespread. Albania was one of the few European countries where the Jewish population grew during WWII.\n\n\n<italic>Panics of 1930, 1931, & 1932</italic>\nAlthough Ohio\u2019s Toledo remained the hub for water transport of Pennsylvania coal into the Great Lakes, WWI\u2019s coal price shock, and LA1920 federal coal lands leases stimulated mining in Illinois, lifting land values. The <italic>Panic of 1920</italic> also led <italic>General Motor</italic> to bypass banks and sell secured CP directly. As credit insurance developed, capital markets allowed retailing \u2018chain stores\u2019 to bypass CP-financed wholesalers to buy manufacturer direct. And all of these helped build consumer installment credit alongside. And, as Insull and other PUs electrified outside of cities, expanded urban limits and fueled a real estate boom. \nAs Illinois outlawed private banks after failures in 1919, Chicago\u2019s<italic> Liberty</italic> LIC\u2014co-founded by Frank Gillespie and Earl Dickerson\u2014became the North\u2019s first Black LIC. Likewise, Jesse Binga reorganized his private bank into <italic>Binga</italic> SB and welcomed Anthony Overton in reorganizing another bank into the first Black-controlled NB, <italic>Douglass</italic> NB. With the help of Samuel Insull, Binga and Overton developed Chicago\u2019s South Side. \nWhile UST permitted NB branching after 1921, Chicago\u2019s legislature prohibited it in 1923. So new unit SBs sprang up along across its extending periphery. To allocate funds between established and developing areas, these banks interlocked directorates. Others merged. Since his sister married Chauncey-Justus Blair at the turn of the century, John Mitchell\u2014President of the <italic>Armour</italic> and <italic>Marshall Field</italic> dominated <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings Bank</italic>\u2014led FRS <italic>Chicago</italic> and saw his son William marry an Armour heiress in 1921 and founded a brokerage that became <italic>Caldwell</italic>\u2019s Chicago correspondent. \nBy 1923, John Mitchell merged his bank with <italic>Merchants Loan & Trust </italic>into <italic>Illinois Merchants Trust </italic>in 1923 and then consolidated with <italic>Corn Exchange</italic> NB in 1924, which subsequently merged with <italic>Continental </italic>NB into<italic> </italic>Chicago main bank,<italic> Continental Illinois</italic><italic> </italic>NB. With Blair as VP, Mitchell remained President and held board seats at <italic>Chase</italic> NB, <italic>Pullman Co</italic>, AT&T, and <italic>Chicago & Alton </italic>RR, and served as Insull\u2019s main banker. \nIllinois and Massachusetts were the only large states to prohibit nonbank corporations from dealing real estate. Unlike Massachusetts\u2014which developed REITs in the 19th century\u2014Illinois, Ohio, and Minnesota banned mortgage negotiability. So Chicago innovated real estate partnerships (\u201cREP\u201d). REPs issued mortgage bonds and preferred equity to finance real estate construction. While common equity held titles and did not trade, corporations arbitraged the real estate prohibition by making loans on REP collateral. \nElsewhere, developers financed operations by interlocking directorates with banks. Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio allowed chain banking, unlike Illinois. As Michigan and Minnesota BHCs acquired real estate laden SBs after the <italic>Panic in 1925</italic>, many fared well during the Depression. In Toledo, however, SBs consolidated without BHCs. \nOhio SBs faced additional burdens. Since 1852, the state imposed an intangibles tax on SBs and other corporations. FRS later deemed this tax insidious to banks\u2014as brokers of intangibles\u2014and it played a role in the <italic>Panic of 1857.</italic> Possibly because of the tax, Ohio <italic>Building & Loan Associations</italic> (\u201cB&L\u201d) developed nonfarm amortized loans that ran for a decade in the 1870s. While the model spread nationally, Ohio remained the focus as courts tied defaults to transfers of title and possession. B&Ls were not subject to runs as tradable shares financed them, not deposits. BA1926 held them outside of bankruptcy as B&Ls had no creditors. While Ohio B&Ls accepted deposits, they were safer than SBs. \nMeanwhile, as <italic>General Motor</italic> (\u201cGM\u201d) grew market share after the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>, the<italic> Willys-Overland </italic>faced more volatile sales. With Toledo\u2019s economy tied to <italic>Willys</italic>\u2019 automobile manufacturing plants and the slowing coal trade, bankruptcy rates rose, and real estate deflated. Along with, While <italic>Lee Higginson</italic> funded GM<italic> </italic>and<italic> Nash Motor</italic>, <italic>Consolidated Edison</italic> Anthony Brady\u2019s son James had funded <italic>Maxwell Motor</italic> and his niece married a <italic>Moseley </italic>heir. In 1925, Walter Chrysler left GM to reorg <italic>Maxwell</italic> into <italic>Chrysler Motor</italic> and then merged her with <italic>Dillon</italic> funded<italic> Dodge</italic> in 1928 with Ferdinand Eberstadt\u2019s aid to form the third largest auto manufacturer after <italic>Ford Motor</italic> and GM<italic>.</italic>\nLike Ohio, other states overtaxed SBs. Since the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Congress only allowed states to tax NBs\u2019 shares and real estate\u2014and no more than SBs or other corporations. As share taxes weakened SBs\u2014particularly those that consolidated\u2014by penalizing surpluses, Congress allowed states to switch NB taxation to net income in 1923. When banks in states adopting this tax shifted investments to tax-free UST and municipals, Congress expanded the scope to gross income to assist private debt. While several states modernized, most did not. Since the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>, Richard Wright\u2019s <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic> became a SB and soon became Philadelphia\u2019s only Black bank.\nProperty tax delinquency grew after the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>.<italic> </italic>Municipalities often tabled the matter rather than realize political and financial costs rather than assist real estate investment by selling tax liens or selling land at auction. As Florida municipals suffered the most, prospective residents feared the state would start taxing income. BA1926 was not conducive to resolving minority creditor holdouts during debt reorgs. Wage-earners petitioned for federal bankruptcy when state law exempted wages from garnishment. Southern municipalities suffered as laborer wages were exempt, so wage earners filed for bankruptcy at 4x the national rate. As cities sold off PUs, GE\u2019s spin-off and <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s PUIHC controlled 56% of the South\u2019s electricity in 1930, versus 33% nationally. \n<italic>Caldwell</italic>\u2019s business<italic> </italic>slowed with falling municipal debt, so she began investing in industrial assets. By the end of the decade, <italic>Caldwell</italic> had acquired over 50 banks spanning from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ohio River, and established branches in New York, Chicago, and over 20 other cities by 1929. For financing and distribution,<italic> Caldwell</italic> depended on <italic>Kidder</italic>, affiliated via Boston\u2019s AT&T. Distributing bonds via inter-state LICs and SBs, <italic>Caldwell </italic>pledged them to access state funds deposited at NBs controlled by his father Roger and Luke Lea. By late 1927, FRS <italic>Atlanta</italic> elected Lea a Class B Director. \nWhile residential real estate declined after the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>, commercial and skyscrapers grew in California, Illinois, and New York after . FA1927 incentivized NB charters by raising loan terms to five years and allowing NBs in New York, Chicago, and Saint-Louis to make real estate loans. Since FA1927 promoted secondary mortgages over amortization, banks could not reorg mortgages without realizing losses and lost bankruptcy priority. SBs did not convert into NBs as FRS did not discount mortgages and NB mergers required SBs to liquidate without loss write-downs like NBs could. From New York to California, BHCs acquired development projects. Like most HCs, BHCs pledged operating shares as collateral for bank loans, sometimes pegging prices. \nThe legislation monetized processes that were already happening. Since Alabama-born Jew Nathan Jonas relocated to Brooklyn with his family in 1869, he assumed the presidency of <italic>Citizens Trust Co</italic> in 1905. After <italic>Citizens Trust Co</italic> merged with <italic>Manufacturers </italic>NB<italic> of Brooklyn </italic>in 1914, the bank changed her name to <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic>. Jonas bought <italic>Bank of America</italic> and organized <italic>Financial & Industrial Securities</italic> BIHC to hold their bank interests in 1925. By 1929, Jonas sold <italic>Bank of America</italic> to <italic>TransAmerica</italic>, controlled by<italic> Bank of Italy</italic>\u2019s Giannini and <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> to <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s IHC, led by Southern Protestant Waddill Catchings and Brooklyn Jew Sydney Weinberg.\nPossibly the only Jewish bank to receive a NB charter, <italic>Bank of the United States</italic> (\u201cBOUS\u201d) BIHC grew from 5 to 62 branches since 1925\u2014with more depositors than any other\u2014and redefining New York City\u2019s skyline. Land values further grew as chains flocked to prime real estate and their scale allowed them to bid up prices beyond conventional levels. \nSimon Strau\u00df\u2014a descendant of Frankfurt bankers through Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother\u2014founded <italic>Franklin Trust &</italic> <italic>Savings Bank </italic>in Chicago in 1911 and moved to New York City in 1915. After Strau\u00df\u2019s nephew married <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>VP Max May Max May\u2019s daughter that year, Strau\u00df\u2019s daughter married a cousin of <italic>Kuhn</italic> co-founder Solomon Loeb\u2019s grandson-in-law in 1917. While May managed large German FX transaction until diplomatic relations were severed, his heritage led him to resign from <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>in 1918, and became a director of <italic>Foreign Trade Banking Corp</italic>, America\u2019s first discount company of its kind. Over this time, Strau\u00df innovated real estate mortgage securities. He incorporated <italic>Strau\u00df</italic> BIHC in Delaware in 1926, and formed <italic>Strau\u00df </italic>NB of Chicago in 1928. <italic>Strau\u00df</italic> BIHC underwrote New York\u2019s <italic>Chanin</italic> and <italic>Chrysler </italic>buildings until Strau\u00df died in 1930.\nSince Illinois courts allowed wage seizures, they protected equity by providing real estate owners a year to redeem properties after foreclosure. By March 1928, Illinois\u2019 Tax Commissioner found the assessment inequitable enough to suspend tax collection until reassessment due in 1929. As delinquencies grew, municipalities followed the usual practice of issuing warrants against anticipated revenue, not knowing the property value. Tennessee\u2019s legislature voted to repeal property taxes in December, but the 1870 constitution left few options. Much of the onus fell on drivers and securities. The legislature targeted <italic>Caldwell </italic>with an inter-state dividend tax. Similarly, Ohio\u2019s legislature limited the 1853 intangibles tax only to banks effective 1931. \nThe disarray of Illinois\u2019 tax system led municipalities to splinter to minimize tax liabilities or exceed debt limits. When collections resumed in 1930, wage assignments backed municipal assets, and Chicago\u2019s public employees depended on Insull\u2019s advances. As South Side real estate investments collapsed in value, Insull infused capital into Jesse Binga\u2019s SB, but Binga refused a takeover from Overton\u2019s <italic>Douglass</italic> NB and failed to raise enough during 1929. \nOn the other hand, Chicago\u2019s capital markets resumed for PUs following the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic>.<italic> </italic>The low-interest rates drove debt, and as Insull and other PUs sold bonds and preferred shares for capital expenditures and acquisitions, Chicago\u2019s collateral loans grew. Despite growing demand, rates fell. With Chicago\u2019s MMSEC money market on par with Paris\u2014behind only New York, London, and Berlin\u2014banks such as Charles Dawes\u2019 <italic>Central Trust</italic> bought Insull\u2019s securities to pledge for loans.\nAfter triggering the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic>, FRS flooded the system with liquidity with UST bond purchases and unprecedented discount rate reductions. So, bank assets tiered as loans shifted to FRS discountable loans and tax-exempt UST and municipal bond investments. And, as UST notes were too short-term to accrue capital gains, banks held the longer maturity bonds to maximize after-tax profits but reduced systemic liquidity.\nBy the late 1920s, the remaining FRS-discountable CP issuers were large enterprises within a few industries. Much of the economy had shifted to the capital markets, and NYSE secured credit. This shift was particularly true within the industrial Midwest, where FRS <italic>Cleveland</italic>, <italic>Chicago</italic>, and <italic>Saint-Louis</italic> Districts\u2014responsible for Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Tennessee\u2014frowned on discounting. \nStill, MMSEC remained the primary money market and bank assets as NYSE secured loans were liquid and margined. With FRS rates near zero, creditors shifted assets from banks to brokers. In March, New York\u2019s legislature exempted security collateral transfers from taxes. The following month, the <italic>New York </italic><italic>Clearinghouse</italic> (\u201cNYCH\u201d) expanded the collateral list to include the over-the-counter <italic>New York Curb Exchange</italic>. MMSEC inflation and FRS\u2019 1929 limits drove creditors to shift to higher-yielding FRS banks. As collateral loans ceased to command interest with MMSEC rates near zero, nonbank investors ran from MMSEC, and banks had less leverage to carry security inventories. \nSince <italic>Harriman </italic>broker founded a New York bank with capital from <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s founder <italic>Samuel</italic> of London in 1927, George Walker returned to <italic>Walker</italic> after Poland rejected <italic>Harriman</italic>\u2019s first PU offer. By 1931, <italic>Harriman</italic> merged with America\u2019s oldest private bank, <italic>Brown</italic>, in 1931, with Walker\u2019s son-in-law Prescott Bush as Partner and Frederick Samuel as Chair of <italic>Brown Harriman</italic> London, as American <italic>Brown</italic> had split with British <italic>Brown Shipley</italic><italic> </italic>in 1918. Likewise, <italic>Brown</italic> kinterlinked with Harriman affiliate Lovett of UPR. \nWhile Prescott\u2019s father Samuel Bush had been a Director <italic>Huntington</italic> NB in Columbus and Class B Director of FRS <italic>Cleveland</italic> since 1927, George Walker\u2019s old firm, <italic>Ely Walker Drygoods</italic> of Saint-Louis, acquired the <italic>Watts-Ritter </italic>of Huntington, West Virginia, and <italic>Moore</italic> <italic>Drygoods</italic> of San Francisco in 1930, creating a nationwide wholesale and manufacturing network, and soon becoming the country\u2019s largest wholesale drygoods house. Although British <italic>Brown Shipley</italic> split from <italic>Brown</italic> in 1918, Linwood Shipley joined <italic>Brown Harriman</italic> by 1932. \nDespite easing HC financing, the Philippines enacted a law favoring municipal PU ownership against <italic>Associated</italic> PUIHC. And New York granted PU reorg oversight to the anti-PUHC Governor FDR, who claimed victory for public construction and management of hydroelectricity on the Saint-Lawrence River prematurely by decades. He name the first five trustees of <italic>New York State Power Authority</italic>, including <italic>Bonbright</italic> cousin James Bonbright\u2014a <italic>Columbia</italic> finance professor, who proposed a PU rate change that was considered radical in 1929\u2014and mechanical engineer Morris Cook, his cousin-in-law through the <italic>Bonbright</italic> banker, who had advised Governor of Pennsylvania Gifford Pinchot.\nLikewise, ICC challenged RIHCs as <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Alleghany</italic> RIHC raised capital. But even after New York liberalized savings bank and <italic>life insurance </italic>(\u201cLIC\u201d) requirements for allowable railroad bonds in 1929, RIHC bans combined with falling railroad earnings to restrict debt refinancing. As the Sweringens moved <italic>Alleghany</italic><italic> </italic>to New York from Cleveland, Henry Cannon\u2014the 80-year-old director and former President of <italic>Chase</italic> and brother of deceased <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> founding director James\u2014married a sister-in-law of <italic>Union Trust</italic>\u2019s John Sherwin by 1930. While the Court supported state chain stores \u2018<italic>trust</italic>\u2019 taxes, she extended <italic>Munn</italic> to allow states to cap gasoline prices in 1929 and ice in 1932. \nAfter BOE helped start the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic> by refusing to discount for Hatry\u2019s steel IHC, her <italic>Bankers\u2019 Industrial Dev </italic>formed steel, coal, and cotton HCs and forced staple industries to consolidate. Still, Congress and Hoover refused to legalize cartels or enact federal regulation. <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Frank Altschul left Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>COALB</italic>\u2019s board by 1924. While George Humphrey joined <italic>COALH</italic> in 1920, his brother married banker Benjamin Strong\u2019s daughter in 1924, reinforcing <italic>COALH</italic>\u2019s kinterlink with <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> since the daughter of Marcus Converse Hanna, a fifth cousin of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>\u2019s Edmund Converse, wed a son of William Moore, cofounder of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> and <italic>STEEL</italic>, in 1909. \nAfter losses, Humphrey took <italic>COALH</italic> public in 1927 and by 1929 fused <italic>COALH</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>coal with <italic>Union Collieries</italic> and <italic>COALH</italic>\u2019s iron ores, West Virginia\u2019s <italic>Weirton Steel</italic>, and Detroit\u2019s <italic>Great Lakes Steel</italic> into <italic>National Steel</italic> to compete with Eaton, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>STEEL</italic>, and Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic>. (Rockefeller and Hanna had been cousin-in-laws through McCormick since 1903.) Although <italic>COALB</italic> cut production rather than wages from 1928, not everyone followed his lead. \nMonths after the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic>, Eaton\u2019s <italic>Continental</italic> IHC formed <italic>Republic Steel </italic>into the third largest steel company by fusing four competitors. Likewise, as PUHC demand for wires fell, <italic>COPPER</italic>\u2019s supra-national AA1918 cartel disbanded in May 1930. The following year, Marjorie Mott Strauss, a daughter and niece of <italic>Seligman</italic> New York partners, married Victor Knauth, a cousin-in-law of <italic>Lee Higginson</italic> London\u2019s Thomas McKittrick, reinforcing kinterlinks since the death of Mott-in-law James Storrow of <italic>Lee</italic>.\nCoal deflated as global oil and gas discoveries. As<italic> OIL </italic>interests\u2019 market shares fell, AA1890 barred America from forming a domestic or joining France\u2019s global oil cartel in 1928. Welding innovation in 1927 piped gas beyond Chicago by 1931. Since antitrust limited horizontal mergers, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>OIL</italic>, <italic>Ford</italic>, and Insull vertically integrated with captive coal mines to hedge supply risk. And as <italic>El Paso Corp</italic>\u2019s pipes became operational in 1930, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>United </italic>PUIHC (1929), SGE, and Insull competed with <italic>OIL</italic> for gas pipes. As ICC prevented railroad price competition, cheap oil and gas reduced coal demand and trucking costs, which competed with railroads. \nAs <italic>COALB</italic> decreased wages in May 1930, by August Britain restricted trucks to reduce railroad competition, forced coal mergers, and fixed coal prices with the <italic>Coal Mines Act</italic>, decreasing output and employment. Without British centralized federalism, America\u2019s Court limited states\u2019 inter-state regulation\u2014as deflation and <italic>Attleboro</italic> nullified <italic>Munn</italic>\u2014real electric prices grew. Since voters decried PU inflation, municipalities sought to replace delinquent property taxes by communalizing PUs. \nAs states called for movie studio control, <italic>Stuart</italic> and required content moderation drafted by Catholic clergy. While the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic> stalled <italic>Fox</italic>\u2019s merger with <italic>Loew </italic>and MGM, FTC opposed on antitrust grounds, influenced by MGM\u2019s Mayer\u2019s connections. Despite years of losses, William Fox\u2019s car accident in 1930 spurred creditors to push <italic>Fox</italic> into receivership. As <italic>Fox</italic> sold MGM to <italic>Loew</italic> by 1931, Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Chase</italic> NB bought <italic>Fox</italic> and invested in <italic>Loew</italic>. MGM led <italic>United Artists</italic> with actors even though actors formed the latter with advice from <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s Ferdinand Eberstadt. While <italic>Strau\u00df</italic> BIHC\u2019s Strau\u00df William funded Jewish Laemmle\u2019s <italic>Universal</italic>, he died in 1930, and <italic>OIL</italic> interests took over.\nAmong the ways that <italic>Fox</italic> competed in America was by contracting for German sound systems from the Dutch-German <italic>Tobis Klangfilm</italic>. While <italic>Western Electric</italic> and RCA tried to expand in Europe, French <italic>Gaumont</italic> developed sound equipment, merged with competitors, and allied with <italic>Tobis Klangfilm</italic> in April 1930. By July, the <italic>Paris Agreement</italic> resolved the Anglo-German sound equipment conflict, dividing the world market: <italic>Tobis Klangfilm</italic> received most of Europe, France was left open for competition, and <italic>Western Electric</italic> and RCA retained America, Canada, and other regions, which <italic>Fox</italic> continued to battle.\nCreated by RCA with <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul, <italic>Atlas,</italic> <italic>Rockefeller</italic>, and <italic>Kennedy</italic> without showmen theater owners, RKO reorganized and <italic>Kennedy</italic> sold out. Likewise, John Hertz, having sold his cab empire to <italic>General Motor</italic> in 1925, joined <italic>Kuhn</italic>-banked <italic>Paramount</italic>. Although the founding Warner family continued to control <italic>Warner</italic>, <italic>Paramount</italic> sold <italic>Columbia Broadcasting System</italic> (\u201cCBS\u201d) to GE, <italic>Lehman</italic>, <italic>Brown Harriman</italic> by 1932. As CBS, RCA\u2019s <italic>National Broadcasting Co</italic> (\u201cNBC\u201d), GE, and <italic>Westinghouse</italic> led national stations chains, the airwaves were crowded were independents. While Jewish David Sarnoff of GE\u2019s RCA<italic> </italic>led NBC, his co-religionists led<italic> Columbia</italic>. However, most local stations outside New York lack Jewish ownership. But that was a long time off.\nRather than ease funding, risk and term premia increased with growing regulation. Industrials had relied on bank loans for working capital and capital markets for capital\u00a0expenditures, but security issuance deflated in early 1930. Businesses contracted trade credit for inventories and capital projects. Rising unemployment and falling tax revenues in the nation\u2019s automobile hub, Detroit, led to fiscal tightening. In Toledo, the founder of <italic>Willys-Overland</italic> sold control to a Chicago BIHC and Toledo bankers as he received a political appointment. \nAs inventory liquidity fell, the new owners idled the plants to maintain dividends. By 1930, most Toledanos were unemployed and lost equity to banks after defaulting on mortgages loans. Following international peers, the unemployed empowered Congress to enact the<italic> Smoot-Hawley </italic>tariff on June 14. With less credit, the <italic>Security-Home SB</italic> further consolidated\u2014without write-downs\u2014to form Toledo\u2019s third-largest depository on June 30. \nAlthough <italic>Continental </italic>IHC\u2019s Eaton sought collaboration, Insull feared losing his control to <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>United </italic>PUIHC. To maintain independence, Insull bought Eaton\u2019s voting shares in June. Insull\u2019s PUIHC financed the transaction using intra-system loans and used remaining voting shares as collateral to refinance with loans from New York SBs. Soon, Eaton supported FDR for President against <italic>Morgan</italic>. \nBack in 1929, to assure full subscription to new UST bond issues with less market-making, UST allowed holders to earn above-market rates by attaching privileges for old issues to be exchanged for new at par. In addition, while interest income would be exempt from all taxes, gains upon sale before maturity were subject to capital gains. UST eliminated the latter provision in mid-June 1930. At the same time, UST prohibited NBs from pledging assets for state funds. Since <italic>Caldwell </italic>depended on pledging assets for NBs funds to market tax-exempt municipal bonds, this law made municipal bonds less attractive tax-exempt options relative to UST bonds.\nAlthough <italic>Caldwell </italic>had consolidated for survival in May 1930 with <italic>BancoKentucky</italic>, a Kentucky BHC, she continued losing liquidity as stocks depreciated and depositors ran, likely due to Tennessee\u2019s 1877 domestic creditor preference. While Nashville\u2019s clearinghouse and FRS <italic>Saint-Louis</italic> deemed <italic>Caldwell</italic>\u2019s loans well secured, they supported the state banking regulator in placing <italic>Caldwell</italic>\u2019s affiliated NB into receivership in November. At that point, Tennessee\u2019s governor vowed to protect state funds. \nAs merger talks with <italic>TransAmerica</italic> broke down, receivers took over <italic>Caldwell</italic>, <italic>Banco </italic>claimed her merger never consummated, and both banks\u2019 correspondents lost liquidity to satisfy depositor demands without their market-makers. Like in most states, regulators could only liquidate banks. So, inter-state regulators and bank managers fire sold securities and spun off stabilizing insurance subsidiaries. \nMunicipalities persuaded banks to extend financing as lower tax revenues and growing required outlays to support unemployed laborers. So, banks shortened terms and required expenditure reductions. As banks substituted from private security collateral loans to UST and municipal debt investments, borrowers ran from private securities. \nFRS neither increased discounts nor could legally discount NYSE securities or MMSEC loans. Since NYSE securities were collateral, MMSEC matched rates for short-seller funds placed as collateral. Brokers used the low stock borrowing rates to balance NYSE. But as states sought to abolish short selling, stock borrowing developed a premium over MMSEC. As brokers could not balance NYSE, NYSE deflated as MMSEC contracted, inflating debt burdens. \nBy September 1930, Hoover appointed WFC\u2019s Eugene Meyer as the first Jewish Governor of FRS to spur the leaderless system\u2014since FRS <italic>New York</italic> Governor Strong died in 1928\u2014into action. Still, deflating NYSE collateral squeezed Cyrus Eaton and other brokers in October. While NYSE prevented him from using existing <italic>Continental </italic>IHC funds to buy a private IHC he owned, <italic>Continental </italic>IHC pledged portfolio securities to borrow money from his IHC. Like with SBs prior to the <italic>Panic of 1907</italic>, NYCH refused to extend membership to BIHCs. As share prices fell, BOUS attempted to stabilize prices. Although most bank failures of late 1930 were related to <italic>Caldwell</italic>, rumors sparked a run from one of BOUS\u2019 branches. \nIn the last quarter of 1930, deposits of Jewish BOUS and <italic>Manufactures Trust</italic> BIHCs fell by a third as those of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> and <italic>Rockefeller</italic>-affiliated <italic>Citi</italic> and <italic>Chase</italic> rose rapidly. As New York City\u2019s mayor sued to protect city money, FRS <italic>New York </italic>refused to discount mortgages and sought to merge BOUS, <italic>Manufactures Trust</italic>, and two other Jewish bankers. Possibly still blaming Jews for the death of his father, John Morgan Jr refused to extend aid through NYCH. After BOUS\u2019 BIHC filed for voluntary equity receivership, BOUS paid out over 80% of deposits, with losses falling on Jewish merchants in New York and European, and several executives were imprisoned.\nAnd as her IHC flopped, <italic>Goldman</italic> sold <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> to <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Rockefeller</italic>, who replaced the founder with Irish Catholic Horace Flanigan as VP, who had married a Busch of the Saint-Louis brewer <italic>Anheuser Busch</italic> family. Through the Busch family, Flanigan was a cousin-in-law of <italic>Citi Farmers Trust </italic>Paris<italic> </italic>banker<italic> </italic>Benjamin McKee, a descendant of President Harrison. \nOn the other hand, <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Tennessee-born Christian Waddill Catchings to resign as President in favor of working-class Jew Sidney Weinberg. As Weinberg rebuilt the firm, he hired Bernard Baruch\u2019s cousin Edgar Baruch, who built up the firm\u2019s trading arbitrage practice with Gustave Levy. \nAs <italic>Kidder</italic> struggled, Edwin Webster\u2014son <italic>Kidder</italic>\u2019s former CEO and scion of Boston Brahmin <italic>Stone Webster</italic> electric engineering consultants\u2014appealed to <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s George Whitney to reorg the firm. By March 1931, <italic>Morgan </italic>and Webster injected equity. Along with Webster, his <italic>Harvard</italic> classmate Albert Gordon joined <italic>Kidder</italic>\u2019s board from <italic>Goldman</italic>.\nAlthough there were more Black banks in Virginia and the South, the Northern Black banks in Chicago and Philadelphia were much larger. Since the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>, Richard Wright\u2019s <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic> became the only Black bank in Philadelphia. And as Binga turned to fraudulent credit in Chicago, the Chicago bank clearinghouse refused to lend to his insolvent bank, and the Illinois\u2019 bank examiner closed <italic>Binga</italic> in November 1930, leaving <italic>Douglass</italic> NB as Chicago\u2019s sole Black bank. Binga was imprisoned for embezzlement. Against competition from White Richmond banks, Maggie Walker consolidated her bank with two other Black-owned banks in 1930. By 1931, she became board Chair of the combined bank until her death in 1934.\nWhile some taxpaying debtors purchased their bonds at depressed prices to save on financing expenses or settle debts as dividends as they unwound. The Court exempted these since 1920 and\u2014by allowing UST to tax only dividends received\u2014fostered HC growth with the <italic>Kerbaugh-Empire</italic> decision of 1926. In January 1931, however, the Court revoked this decision and allowed UST to tax dividends paid out. The following month, the Court denied a land mortgagee from foreclosing without the court, in line with custom. As stock lending for shorts increased, NYCH reduced margins on June 4th to reinflate NYSE. However, panic spread before this credit could materialize. Although large banks withstood runs better, interlocks lacked legal claim to assets. \nOn June 4th, one of America\u2019s remaining Jewish NBs, <italic>Foreman</italic>, faced a liquidity crisis in bailing out small legacy SB <italic>of Chicago</italic> banks outside of the Loop. Two days later, the Chicago bank clearinghouse financed <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic>\u2019s acquisition of two of <italic>Foreman</italic>\u2019s largest banks, triggering a cascade of bank failures, including six of <italic>Foreman</italic>\u2019s orphaned banks, twelve <italic>Bain</italic> banks, and others. As runs spread to NB <italic>of the Republic</italic>, which controlled eight banks and interlocked directorates with another four, NB <italic>of the Republic</italic> merged with<italic> Central Trust</italic>\u2014owned by Charles Dawes, President Coolidge\u2019s former VP and then Ambassador to Britain\u2014on July 25th, forming <italic>Central Republic Bank & Trust Co</italic>. Still, Chicago\u2019s foreclosures accelerated. \nMeanwhile, Philadelphia stockbroker <italic>Henry Kirkbride</italic> liquidated via a voluntary bankruptcy after the founder died. Using the land mortgage decision, the district court prevented <italic>Morgan </italic>and other secured lenders from selling the pledged collateral without her permission on June 10th. As loan collateral risk increased, NYSE issued more rules against shorting. Although depositors ran from <italic>Chatham Phenix</italic> NB and BOUS-type banks affiliated with depreciating BIHCs, two-thirds of American bank suspensions and deposits remained in Toledo and Chicago between April and August. \nDespite IHC share prices depreciating faster and below their underlying stock values, few IHCs failed as other IHCs and investors bought their shares. The most important of these purchasers was Floyd Odlum\u2019s <italic>Atlas</italic>, which<italic> </italic>bought the BIHC controlling the <italic>Empire State Building</italic> from <italic>Chatham Phenix</italic> NB in August. Likewise, <italic>Atlas</italic> acquired <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> affiliated <italic>Sterling </italic>IHC. Likewise, <italic>Atlas</italic>\u2019 invested <italic>Becker</italic>\u2019s IHC in return for investment. As <italic>Atlas</italic> and other firms exchanged stock for shares in funds trading at significant discounts, she underwrote securities and reorganized debt and management. \nSimilarly, BIHC and PUIHC continued to reinforce one another. Already Chair of <italic>Niagara Hudson </italic>PUHC and a director of New York\u2019s<italic> </italic><italic>Consolidated Gas </italic>PUHC, <italic>Citi</italic> NB, <italic>Bonbright</italic>, <italic>First </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Second</italic> NB of Oswego, and other institutions, <italic>Carlisle </italic>President Floyd Carlisle was elected Chair of New York\u2019s <italic>Consolidated</italic><italic> Edison</italic>. By June 1931, he joined the board of <italic>Marine Midland</italic>, which acquired <italic>First </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Second</italic> NB of Oswego, reinforcing links with <italic>Stone Webster Blodget</italic>, <italic>White Weld</italic>, <italic>Barney</italic>, and <italic>Schoellkopf Hutton Pomeroy</italic>. While <italic>DuPont</italic>\u2019s IHC remained the family HC for protecting their <italic>United</italic> PUIHC and other shareholdings, Francis DuPont shifted from chemistry to finance, founding <italic>DuPont</italic> brokerage in 1931.\nLikewise, <italic>Lehman</italic> bought back <italic>Lehman</italic> IHC shares\u2014a third by 1932\u2014her <italic>General American</italic> IHC, co-led with <italic>Lazard </italic>New York\u2019s Altschul, also stabilized. Unlike HCs, IHCs were not subject to AA1914. As Cyrus Eaton consolidated steel and rubber enterprises with <italic>Continental </italic>IHC, he sued to prevent Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic> from merging with <italic>Youngstown</italic> under AA1890. As <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>STEEL</italic>\u2019s market share halved since 1901, fragmented consolidation could not stabilize prices. By March 1931, the supra-national steel AA1918 cartel that stabilized prices from 1926, disbanded, and prices collapsed. Similarly, DOJ sued to dissolve <italic>SUGAR</italic>.\nWhile coal inflation raised employment, land values, and municipal taxes, they fell with low-labor oil and gas discoveries. In the coal entrep\u00f4t of Toledo, <italic>Security-Home SB</italic> stockholders\u2019 equity was wiped out by June, even though the excess liabilities were half of the shrinkage allowance. So, Ohio\u2019s banking regulator placed the FRS-nonmember SB\u2014without assistance from the WFC, Toledo\u2019s bank clearinghouse, or more mergers\u2014into receivership. This decision precipitated a run from similar banks, forcing them to close after failing to merge within the 60-day stay\u2014and accelerated the local deflation. As bankruptcies negated bank mortgage assets, B&Ls and other nonbanks took over as real estate creditors.\nWhile Texas\u2019 antitrust law of 1889 blocked <italic>OIL</italic> and prohibited natural gas burning, ruinous competition hordes resumed consolidations and output controls. After Texas courts struck down TRC\u2019s pools in late July 1931, Oklahoma\u2019s governor used state troops to limit oil production and burn gas in August. As he moved to seize PUHCs\u2019 pipes, <italic>Tri Utilities </italic>filed for receivership. \nUpon the failure, FTC resumed investigations, and state regulation grew. New York Governor FDR established PUHC restrictions and federal PUs in his election platform, increasing appropriation risks. As operating PUs decreased dividends, PUHC securities deflated, forcing Insull and other PUHCs to meet margin calls. So, the PUHCs pledged additional operating company shares as bank loan collateral to peg share prices, pay dividends, and support weaker segments. \nBack in 1930, John Rockefeller Jr\u2019s son Nelson wed Mary Roberts Clark\u2014whose mother was a daughter of <italic>PENN</italic>\u2019s George Roberts and father was Enoch Clark\u2019s grandson and connected to <italic>COALB</italic> with <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2014and Nelson\u2019s cousin James Stillman Rockefeller joined <italic>Citi</italic>. While Roberts third cousin John Paul was a <italic>Drexel</italic> partner and married Anthony Drexel\u2019s daughter when he became head of <italic>PENN</italic>, Roberts\u2019 second cousin married in 1932, Wistar Morris \u2014an extended cousin-in-law of the Drexels, treasurer of <italic>GAS</italic>, and cousin of <italic>Girard Trust</italic> President Effingham Morris, whose cousin-once-removed married into the Rensselaer and Drexel family. That same year, Wistar\u2019s daughter married William Morrow Roosevelt, nephew of <italic>Roosevelt</italic>\u2019s Nicholas Roosevelt.\nConcluding that short-term <italic>pound</italic> liabilities exceeded assets in July, the <italic>Macmillan Report</italic> recommended devaluation and tariffs, starting the <italic>European Panic of 1931</italic>. As German creditors repatriated gold from London following the <italic>Standstill Agreement</italic>, Parliament sought to increase already high taxes on September 11th. Fearing similar taxes as bankers and Congress blamed the <italic>Panic of 1929 </italic>on capital gains, Americans sold securities to realize capital losses while they could. As Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general allowed solvent banks to secure public funds deposits with pledged assets the same day, UST allowed banks to account for investment-grade debt at cost the following day. \nUST bond yields increased as Europeans sold American assets to repatriate gold after the British suspension on September 20th. Although NYSE opened unlike most exchanges, she instituted a complete short-selling ban for two days. As the prohibition included brokers, stock prices inflated. After international exchanges reopened, NYSE increasingly limited short starting from October. Still, gold outflows continued pushing up inflation and UST debt yields. While FRS hiked interest rates, pressure on UST to increase taxes grew. With debt markets collapsing, corporate defaults increased. \nWithout assistance from FRS <italic>Cleveland</italic>, Pittsburgh NBs chose receivership after inter-state correspondents ran from them. As with banks, the receivers\u2019 fire sales of brokers\u2019 loans secured with illiquid <italic>Curb </italic>collateral spread margin calls to borrowers with similar collateral. Starting in September, bank runs spread from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Chicago through October. Amidst the runs, <italic>Union Trust</italic> of Cleveland sold repurchase agreements to New York\u2019s <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>,  <italic>Citi</italic>, and <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>.\nWhile President Hoover and FRS Governor Meyer encouraged NYCH and other major banks to organize a bank consortium <italic>National Credit Corp</italic> (\u201cNCC\u201d) and broaden discounts and increase liquidity, fears of exchange suspension accelerated a cycle of security sales and collateral loan margin calls, forcing HC reorgs. \n<italic>TransAmerica</italic>\u2019s Giannini made Elisha Walk Chair and his friend Jean Monnet board Vice Chair after buying <italic>Blair</italic> and Hellman\u2019s banks in California in 1930. Unable to monetize their mortgage assets, Walk and Monnet tried to sell <italic>Bank of America</italic> to <italic>Citi </italic>in 1931 and liquidate <italic>TransAmerica</italic> BIHC in early 1932, Giannini forced them to resign after winning the proxy fight. \nSince short-selling stocks in 1929, Texan Robert Young acquired a controlling interest in <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>Alleghany </italic>RIHC, including <italic>Chesapeake & Ohio</italic> RR, in 1931. Refusing to share his plans with <italic>Morgan </italic>and accused the firm of manipulating railroad sales to their benefit. Young retained <italic>Lehman</italic> as his banker. But as railroad financing fell, so did sales, leading Pittsburgh\u2019s steel industry relied on Detroit automobiles. \nIn November, the Court reverberated that UST could tax payouts\u2014including insolvent company reorgs\u2014unlike <italic>Kerbaugh-Empire</italic>. Even HC reorgs from 1928 and 1929 may have been taxable with this decision. The same month, NYCH taxed nonbank corporations to force them out of MMSEC. Another PUHC filed for bankruptcy in January 1932 as business failures increased to avoid selling securities. Although Republicans controlled Congress, Democrats increasingly called to tax stock transfers and other wealth sources. \nSoon after,<italic> </italic>a run on <italic>Deseret</italic> NB of Salt Lake City, Utah, required a rescue by <italic>First Security</italic> BHC\u2019s Marriner Eccles and Elbert Bennett, who bought <italic>National Copper Bank </italic>in March 1929 and several other banks in 1931, strengthened their ties with Utah\u2019s Mormon community. Eccles\u2019 extended relative, Brigham Young had established <italic>Deseret</italic> NB<italic> </italic>in 1871 and <italic>Zions First</italic> NB in 1873 to serve the financial needs of the Mormon Church.\nAs liquidity collapsed, banks sold UST bonds fell, and business failures accelerated. Creditors increasingly demanded payment in gold contract clauses. In January 1932, <italic>Atlas </italic>agreed to make a minority investment into <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s IHC, which forced <italic>Goldman</italic> to sell <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> to <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Rockefeller</italic> a year earlier, with <italic>Atlas</italic>\u2019 Frank Odium holding two board seats. The same month, <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> bought <italic>Chatham Phenix</italic> NB since <italic>Atlas</italic> bought <italic>Chatham Phenix</italic> NB\u2019s BIHC and the <italic>Empire State Building</italic> in August 1931. \nTo replace the private NCC, Hoover appointed FRS Governor Eugene Meyer as Chair of Congress\u2019 new off-budget <italic>Reconstruction Finance Corp</italic> (\u201cRFC\u201d). For President of RFC, Hoover summoned Charles Dawes. With UST-backed debt, RFC lent on appreciated UST collateral\u2014to alleviate capital taxes\u2014and bought depreciated railroad bonds. <italic>TransAmerica</italic> BIHC and <italic>Alleghany</italic> RIHC were among the first borrowers. \nHoover also replaced the 77-year-old Andrew Mellon  with Ogden Livingston Mills as UST Secretary. A son of deceased banker Ogden Mills\u2014an associate of Bernard Baruch\u2014unrelated to <italic>Glyn</italic>, but a cousin of Ruth Cavendish-Bentinck Livingston\u2014who had married John Morgan\u2019s Burns nephew in 1908\u2014Mills was married to the former wife of John Fell, a descendant of Anthony Drexel. \nSince there were few CP,  monetized UST debt by allowing FRS to count it as reserves instead of gold. FA1932 temporarily expanded FRS discountable securities to include UST bonds and promissory notes. But while New York SBs lent the receipts from FRS <italic>New York</italic>\u2019s purchases to Chicago on stock collateral, FRS <italic>New York </italic>sunset purchases by April as her gold depleted. \n<italic>Kreuger</italic> sold Swedish <italic>Ericsson</italic> telephony to IT&T, but IT&T withdrew after an audit. Ivar Kreuger turned to Swedish banks but died in March 1932. While possibly murdered, most assumed suicide. Swedish receivers left little for the IHC as they fire sold assets. Having paid scrip since 1931, Chicago suspended payments to city workers indefinitely. PUs and banks advanced taxes. Still, FRS <italic>Chicago</italic> could not afford to increase discounts. As New York declared a moratorium for solvent railroads from bond downgrades retroactive to 1930, allowing banks and insurance companies to invest unless the railroad firms defaulted. \nSo, insurers bought more railroad and UST bonds. Although PU operators had some protections like railroads, PUHCs did not. They suffered as capital market yields spiked amid falling UST bond and money market yields. While banks sold collateral when a Boston-based PUIHC defaulted, the IHC survived. Others forced investors to subscribe to debt reorgs. However, as Insull\u2019s PUIHC pledged voting shares, banks forced them into receivership after the PUIHC failed to meet margin calls on May 15, 1932. Some blamed <italic>Morgan</italic>. The Court reiterated her stance against non-railroad receiverships instead of liquidation the next day in a separate case. \nDespite RFC\u2019s rescue attempt, Anthony Overton\u2019s <italic>Douglass</italic> NB of Chicago, the first Black-controlled institution to become a NB, failed on May 26. While investment banks oversaw receiverships, they hired management consultants to assist them in reorgs and strategy. Starting in the 1920s, <italic>McKinsey</italic>, <italic>Booz</italic>, and <italic>Arthur Anderson</italic> remained small. By May 28, Insull\u2019s operating PU boards called on James Simpson to lead them through the crisis. Simpson had chaired and owned retailer <italic>Marshall Field</italic>, an affiliate of Chicago\u2019s main bank, <italic>Continental Illinois</italic><italic> </italic>NB. As Simpson left, <italic>Marshall Field</italic> hired James McKinsey, Head of <italic>McKinsey</italic>, as Chair until his death in 1937. Around the same time, Sewell Avery\u2014an extended cousin of the Morgan and Rockefeller families\u2014of SB <italic>& Trust Co</italic> in Evanston, Illinois, helped fund <italic>Booz</italic>, which conducted surveys for Avery\u2014including his bank, <italic>Gypsum</italic>, and <italic>Montgomery Ward</italic>\u2014and other Chicago businesses.\nAlso on May 28th, Illinois\u2019 district court shocked bankers by prohibiting New York SBs from selling collateral in the bankruptcy of Insull\u2019s PUIHC. While Chicago defaulted on her June 1st bond obligations, local banks covered the payment. Within days, <italic>Atlas </italic>bid on a dozen BIHC minority investments. One of her purchases was the Chicago-domiciled PUIHC that held London\u2019s PU, Britain\u2019s largest.\nAlthough UST yields fell in March, Congress enacted  on June 6, limiting NOCs, capping capital losses to offset gains, and taxing intra-HC dividends. Since debt interest remained tax-exempt, investors ran from equity to debt. And as TA1932 taxed bank checks, depositors ran from banks to transact with untaxed currency. In addition to extending <italic>Smoot-Hawley</italic> with tariff-like excise taxes on coal and oil, TA1932 aided collieries with TA1926\u2019s depletion allowances for oil drillers.\nWhile Charles Dawes resigned as President of RFC on June 7th, one of his <italic>Central Republic Bank & Trust Co</italic>\u2019s banks failed on June 14th. Within a week RFC bailed out <italic>Central Republic Bank & Trust Co</italic> with her single largest loan, and three times the size of all the loans the Federal government made to states for relief for the unemployed and homeless that year. <italic> </italic>On June 22, the court overseeing Insull\u2019s PUIHC bankruptcy still did not allow liquidation, but the judge now refused to consider shareholder claims. <italic>Chase</italic> director Eugene Rensselaer Thayer later served as receiver for Insull\u2019s <italic>Mississippi Valley </italic>PUHC.\nDespite bearable losses, Chicago banks lost liquidity as FRS did not discount mortgages. Left with illiquid debt and unable to pay panicking depositors, they entered receivership. As national industrial production collapsed, PUHCs failed. Then, an appeals court reversed the June 28th decision on inter-state pledged collateral sales by late October. Within days, New York Governor FDR won the Presidency. While DOJ pushed Insull into near poverty, the courts later exculpated him. Courts similarly acquitted <italic>Stuart</italic> after three DOJ indictments. \n",
