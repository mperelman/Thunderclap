Congressional acts combine category and year. Holding companies and corporations identified with \u201cHC\u201d. \u201cMM\u201d prefixes identify short-term liquid debt money markets. Names of people are not <italic>italicized</italic>, but <italic>firm</italic> names are and do not use definite articles. Some other institutional proper nouns are also <italic>italicized</italic>. Acronyms are generally not <italic>italicized</italic>. Descendancy is usually direct. Cousinhood is often of the first order, unless a surname, then usually implies several marriages between the surnamed families. Middle names are either maternal or maiden surnames. Some surnames have been changed for differentiation from others (e.g., Smith to Smyth).\n\n\n<italic>Panics of 1933 & 1937</italic>\nIn 1916, Congress founded the <italic>Federal Farm Loan Board System </italic>(\u201cFFLB\u201d) to supply European allies with agricultural products. While FFLB issued tax-exempt debt, joint-stock land banks (\u201cJSLBs\u201d) without joint-liability made mortgages. With debt, farms and cooperatives\u2014exempt from AA1914 since 1922\u2014mechanized and improve lands as electrification from Insull expanded efficiency. \nAs Southern cotton particularly suffered after the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, President Coolidge promoted Eugene Meyer from the defunct WFC to chair an emergency cotton commission and control dumping. By September 1930, President Hoover appointed Meyer as the first Jewish Governor of FRS to spur the leaderless system\u2014since FRS <italic>New York</italic> Governor Strong died in 1928\u2014into action.\nWhile Harlem developer Henry Guggenheim Morgenthau Sr served as Wilson\u2019s Ambassador to Turkey, his secular son, Henry Jr, worked with Hoover\u2019s <italic>Food Administration</italic> project. In 1916, he wed Elinor Fatman, a cousin of <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York Frank Altschul\u2019s cousin-in-law. Elinor\u2019s mother worked with Eleanor Roosevelt, and the two became close friends. Henry Jr also became friends with FDR after polio struck the latter in 1921. \nAfter retaining Francis Perkins from Governor Smith\u2019s administration, FDR also gained the support of friend and supporter of Soviet and German socialism, Averell Harriman. FDR also befriended Democrat bankers. Since Tennessee-born Christian Waddill Catchings withdrew as President of <italic>Goldman </italic>in 1930, working class Sidney Weinberg took over management and supported FDR. \nSimilarly, Catholic banker Joseph Kennedy supported FDR since working with him during WWI and for campaigning to end Prohibition. Other Democrat bankers included Arthur Seligmann, helped the New Mexican Territory become a state in 1912 and, after WWII, led <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Santa</italic> Fe from 1924. Along with helping reorganize Santa F\u00e9 county debt resulting from railroad aid and courthouse bonds, he led the Irrigation Commission. From 1931, Seligmann became New Mexico\u2019s first native-born governor not of Spanish ancestry until his death in 1933.\nDespite doubling in numbers since 1900, Jews accounted for 80 thousand out of America\u2019s 30 million farmers. Efforts to transition Jews from urban centers to rural colonies have faced limited success, likely due to historical legal barriers in European landownership for Jews. While early attempts, such as Major Noah\u2019s \u2018Ararat\u2019 in 1818 and \u2018Sholom\u2019 in Ulster County, New York, between 1837 and 1850, were unrealized or short-lived, <italic>Hirsch</italic>\u2019s endeavors after Russian pogroms were limited to places like the Woodbine in Cape May County, New Jersey.\nMeanwhile, Southern PUs could not afford to charge rural subsistence farmers as families. While the number of Northeast farms fell most by 1930, Southern tenancy set a record. Serf-like sharecroppers made up 77% of Black and 45% of Whites. Establishing 134 banks since 1888, Black-owned bank assets peaked in 1926. Many failed after 1929 and only 12 of the 134 still existed in 1936, including Maggie Walker\u2019s <italic>Consolidated Bank & Trust</italic> (1903) and Herman Perry\u2019s <italic>Citizens Trust</italic> (1921). \nJSLB assets peaked in 1927, when three JSLBs fell into receivership. As these entities were bankrupt under BA1926, JSLBs stockholders\u2019 double liability politicized Midwestern banking. Coolidge appointed Eugene Meyer to reorg FFLB, but Congress did not give FFLB receivership powers like UST had for NBs in 1930 or exempt JSLBs from AA1914 per FRS. Instead, <italic>life insurance companies</italic> (\u201cLICs\u201d) tripled Ohio farm acquisitions.\nSince the North\u2019s first Black LIC, <italic>Liberty</italic> LIC of Chicago merged with <italic>Supreme </italic>of Columbus and <italic>Northeastern</italic> of Newark in 1929, John Rockefeller Jr stabilized his control stake in the world\u2019s largest LIC, <italic>Equitable</italic>. Having sold off <italic>Citi</italic> in 1909, he bought New York\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Chase</italic>, from <italic>Kuhn</italic> in 1930 to fuse with the family\u2019s <italic>Equitable Trust</italic>. While <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s Albert Wiggin became CEO of the new entity, <italic>Equitable</italic>\u2019s Winthrop Aldrich became President. \nWhile Winthrop was a son of Nelson Aldrich\u2014Rhode Island\u2019s Senator and father of FRS with Paul Warburg\u2014his sister married John Rockefeller Jr in 1901. Graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard </italic>Law, Winthrop served in the Naval Reserve during WWI. After becoming associated with <italic>Rockefeller</italic> during the proxy fight for control of <italic>OIL</italic><italic> of Indiana</italic> in the 1920s. By August 1930, <italic>Chase</italic> bought investment bank <italic>Harris Forbes</italic>, and President of <italic>Harris Forbes</italic> Boston John Macomber became Chair of the new <italic>Chase Harris Forbes</italic>. As John Rockefeller Jr\u2019s son Nelson wed Mary Roberts Clark\u2014whose father was Enoch Clark\u2019s grandson and mother was a daughter of <italic>PENN</italic>\u2019s George Roberts\u2014that year, his cousin James Stillman Rockefeller joined <italic>Citi</italic>.\nWhile Jewish banks promoted relatives, they also hired Christians. Soon after promoting the sons of three partners\u2014including Mortimer Schiff\u2019s John, Otto Kahn\u2019s Gilbert, and Felix Warburg\u2019s Frederick, who had trained at <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2014in 1931, <italic>Kuhn</italic> added Lehman-in-law Benjamin Buttenwieser and the <italic>Blair</italic>-alum Christian Elisha Walk by 1932. Since the mostly Christian <italic>Lazard</italic> London promoted Robert Kindersley\u2019s son Hugh to Managing Director, David Langhorne Astor joined as a clerk after he graduated <italic>Oxford</italic>, but he transitioned to journalism two years later, a field more in line with his interests. Even in France, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 \u00c9douard hired his son\u2019s tutor, Ren\u00e9 Fillon, as a Department Head that year.\nWhen <italic>Speyer</italic> Frankfurt liquidated in 1934, <italic>Speyer</italic> New York hired George Lindsay as a Partner. The Christian Lindsay joined <italic>Salamon</italic> in 1904, where he remained until her merger with <italic>Blair</italic>. He served as a Partner there until 1932, when he advised RFC and was fiscal agent for FHLB\u2019s <italic>Home Owners</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Loan Corp</italic> in DC.\nSince fusing <italic>International Acceptance </italic>IHC into <italic>Manhattan </italic>NB, Paul Warburg died in 1932. As <italic>Kuhn</italic> absorbed the BIHC, elected Christian Hugh Knowlton partner in late 1932. Since Hugh Knowlton married Christine Stanley in 1917, he became VP of <italic>International Acceptance </italic>in 1926 and later the VP of <italic>International Manhattan</italic>. \nBy 1933, most of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s active partners were not Jews. Jewish partners included Felix Warburg, who was semi-retired, his more active son Frederick, John Schiff, Benjamin Buttenwieser, and Lewis Strauss, managing the syndicate department. While some were secular, converted Otto Kahn, with limited involvement due to health, and his son Gilbert were also partners. Christian-born partners included William Wiseman, active in international affairs, George Bovenizer, who led the bond business, Hugh Knowlton, and Elisha Walk.\nMeanwhile, Christine Staney Knowlton\u2019s brother Harold grew from President of <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>of New York to a <italic>Morgan </italic>partner in 1927 as Morrow left to become Ambassador of Mexico. After promoting Henry Davison Jr and Thomas Lamont to partners in 1929, <italic>Morgan </italic>hired Seymour Gilbert of <italic>Cravath</italic> in 1931 and Charles Dickey of <italic>Brown Harriman </italic>in 1932. While <italic>Kuhn</italic> had non-Jewish partners since 1928, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kidder</italic>, and other Protestant banks did not have any Jewish partners until decades after WWII.\nAlthough Ferdinand Eberstadt, a second cousin of <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Otto Kahn, Paris Rothschilds, and Dreyfus families, was one of <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>first fellow converted high caste Jews, he resigned in 1931 to go independent and invest in chemicals companies. That year, Douglas Dillon, the son of <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s founder, Clarence, bought a NYSE seat and joined the firm after graduating <italic>Harvard</italic>. He also hired his classmate, the descendant of a fellow converted high caste Jew, August Belmont IV, as VP, as <italic>Belmont</italic> dissolved. \n<italic>Dillon</italic> also hired fellow <italic>Harvard</italic> graduate Paul Nitze. While his father was a professor at <italic>Uni of Chicago</italic>, the family relied on his grandfathers\u2019 financial support. One grandfather was a geologist who conducted a survey in Russia and became an Honorary Consul for Russia in Baltimore, the other was a merchant who worked with the North German <italic>Lloyd</italic> and became an Honorary Consul for Germany in Baltimore in 1926. By 1932, Nitze married the granddaughter of an <italic>OIL</italic> co-founder.\nWhile coal inflation raised employment, land values, and municipal taxes, all fell with discoveries of low-labor oil and gas. Congress refused to permit cartels or enact federal regulation. And as ICC prevented price competition, cheap oil and gas reduced demand for coal and trucking costs, lowering railroad profits and financial solvency. Like administered railroad prices, electricity remained stable as deflation and <italic>Attleboro</italic> nullified <italic>Munn</italic>. As state antitrust-inspired oil laws prohibited gas burning, revisions allowed it to stabilize prices from 1931. Likewise, they limited trucking and pushed <italic>Tri Utilities</italic> PUHC into receivership. \nAlthough Britain and AA1918 American cartels limited trade in the 1920s, Indonesia and the Soviet Union grew exports. However, the <italic>Smoot-Hawley</italic> tariff of 1930 exacerbated farm deflation relative to administered PU and railroad prices. So, as farmer and coaler incomes fell, real debts grew. After Congress purchased and warehoused crops, she sold from 1931, and agricultural collateral loan margins grew. As Chicago banks collapsed, farm bankruptcies grew across FRS <italic>Chicago</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>District, particularly in Iowa. Without credit, courts allowed LICs to foreclosures farms. Other states banned corporate farms to decrease prices. As the copper and steel AA1918 supra-national cartels disbanded, commodity prices deflated after the British suspension as the Dutch and Americans remained on gold. While Parliament subsidized <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Greek PU in 1931, SGE and GGE\u2019s Belgian PUHC continued in Brazil and Spanish America until WWII.\nEven as federal UST bonds increased since 1900, municipalities and states accounted for most public debt. With depressed capital markets after the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic>, cities like New York and Detroit\u2014America\u2019s automobile center\u2014reduced municipal spending and unemployment benefits. Within the beleaguered FRS <italic>Chicago</italic> district, Michigan\u2019s largest BHCs\u2014Detroit\u2019s <italic>Guardian</italic> and <italic>Detroit Bankers Co</italic>\u2014satisfied withdrawals by selling or pledging liquid assets for RFC loans. By 1932, they had had only illiquid real estate and municipal debt. While Detroit\u2019s largest taxpayer and employer, motor company <italic>For</italic><italic>d</italic>, supported <italic>Guardian</italic> BHC via deposits rather than capital investment. \nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1932</italic>, Congress established the FRS-like <italic>Federal Home Loan Bank System </italic>(\u201cFHLB\u201d) to discount non-farm real estate mortgages. However, it remained little used. Since FA1927 promoted secondary mortgages over amortization, banks could not reorg mortgages without realizing losses and lost bankruptcy priority. While RFC aid quelled the <italic>Panic of 1932</italic>, Congress rebuked Chicago\u2019s aid request. As yields collapsed, FRS stopped buying UST bonds. When RFC bailed out RFC President Charles Dawes\u2019 Chicago bank, Congress made permanent FA1932\u2019s discounting to nonbanks and disclosure requirements in July 1932. \nBut transparency stigmatized borrowing and banks shied away. Still, RFC lent to municipalities\u2014that had not defaulted\u2014on self-liquidating revenue bond collateral to aid unemployed laborers and poor farmers. In addition to aiding collieries and oil drillers with depletion allowances, TA1932 extended <italic>Smoot-Hawley</italic> with tariff-like excise taxes on these raw materials. By 1933, Congress disclosed all prior RFC recipients. As bank shares sank, BHCs wrote down their assets.\nEarlier, Michigan voters destabilized municipal budgets by limiting rising real property taxes in the 1932 election. When RFC increased loans to the <italic>Ford</italic>-affiliated <italic>Guardian</italic> BHC, Michigan\u2019s senator\u2014and <italic>Ford</italic> co-founder\u2014held these illegal in RFC oversight. As he called on <italic>Ford</italic> to subordinate deposits, <italic>Ford</italic> threatened to withdraw them. As President Hoover mediated this negotiation, RFC pulled away, and\u2014without panic\u2014the governor enacted a state-wide bank holiday. \nUnable to tap banks, Detroit defaulted on her debt. Meanwhile, farmers rioted as foreclosures increased. From January 1933, LICs halted foreclosures\u2014and investment\u2014until state debt reforms. In response, Iowa led farm states in mortgage moratoria. As the moratoria destabilized banks, more states enacted bank holidays. For the first time in decades, Americans ran from banks nationally. As Cleveland\u2019s <italic>Union Trust</italic> and <italic>Guardian</italic> <italic>Trust</italic> were forced to reorg, <italic>Guardian Trust</italic> was liquidated, and <italic>Union Commerce Bank</italic> emerged. \nWhile continuing to propagate antisemitic diatribes during the crisis, demagogues, including two Catholics\u2014Louisiana\u2019s populist Democratic Governor Huey Long and radio personality turned priest Charles Coughlin\u2014soon incorporated President-elect FDR into their conspiracy theories amid the turmoil. Also in January, Rockefeller-in-law<italic> </italic>Winthrop Aldrich of <italic>Chase</italic> advocated separating commercial banking from securities underwriting, and placing banks under the authority of FRS, which his father helped create. As CEO Albert Wiggin resigned in January 1933, and Aldrich became Chair. \nFRS reduced rates but refused to suspend FRS District Bank reserve requirements, like during the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>. UST bond yields grew with gold suspension fears, forcing FRS to increase rates in late February. During the moratorium in March, Aldrich again advocated separating commercial banking from securities underwriting and urged that all commercial banks be brought under FRS oversight. \nSince the <italic>Pecora Hearings</italic> against bankers started in 1932, <italic>Citi</italic> faced intense scrutiny by 1933. During the hearings, <italic>Citi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Chair Charles Mitchell confessed to selling stock to his wife in 1929 to avoid taxes. Months before Mitchell was acquitted, he drew public ire and resigned from <italic>Citi</italic> during the scandal. Instead, Boston Brahmin James Perkins became Chair of <italic>Citi</italic> and overhauled her capital structure. Graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> and working at various banks, Perkins became a colonel during WWI and was then elected President of <italic>Farmers</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Loan & Trust</italic>. As the latter affiliated with <italic>Citi</italic> in 1929, Perkins became President of <italic>Citi Farmers Trust </italic>and a <italic>Citi</italic> director. And as <italic>Citi</italic> promoted Gordon Rentschler to President in 1929, his brother Frederick expanded <italic>United Aircraft.</italic> Their niece married Mitchell\u2019s son by 1936. \nWhile Perkins had the approval of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s influential director Percy Rockefeller, the latter resigned in 1933 due to poor health, allowing Floyd Carlisle, head of <italic>Niagara Hudson </italic>PUHC and Chair of <italic>Consolidated Gas </italic>PUHC, to expand his influence. Ill health also forced Sidney Mitch to resign from SGE, whose son subsequently assumed leadership of <italic>Bonbright</italic>. As Landon Thorne and his brother-in-law Alfred Loomis\u2014a cousin of John Morgan\u2019s former lawyer Henry Stimson\u2014left <italic>Bonbright</italic>, they were elected directors and executive committee members of the <italic>Morgan</italic>-affiliated <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, having purchased John Rockefeller\u2019s stock block.\nInstead of devaluation, President Hoover chose debt reorgs. With  on March 3rd, Hoover\u2019s Congress federalized reorgs for individuals, farmers, and railroads. BA1933 removed BA1926\u2019s insolvency requirement for filing and allowed majority compositions to cram down reorgs to dissenting secured creditors. Of these, only railroad filings exploded. Since Hoover refused to declare a national bank holiday, more states declared bank holidays. The governor of Illinois refused to declare a holiday unless New York acted first, and Governor Lehman of New York initially refused to declare a holiday until asked by a responsible authority in the state. Pennsylvania\u2019s governor was difficult to reach and had to be roused by a fire truck. \nUpon his March 4th inauguration, FDR extended bank holidays nationally, with moratoria on NYSE, the <italic>Chicago Board of Trade</italic>, and insurance payouts. Although municipalities, businesses, and relief agencies already circulated scrip, bank clearinghouses now issued certificates. Among the bankers FDR\u2019s administration contracted with for a plan to reopen the banks was Republican James Loeb Warburg, who then supported the <italic>New Deal</italic> and later served as America\u2019s monetary delegate in London.\nBanks reopened after FRS vouched for solvency and Congress enacted the  (\u201cEBA\u201d). EBA stopped the bank runs by allowing non-bankruptcy bank conservation and majority compositions to cram down dissenting shareholders. Instead of monetizing UST bonds, EBA empowered FRS to create gold-less bank money. While hiring <italic>Morgan</italic>-affiliated Woodin as UST Secretary, FDR appointed Henry Morgenthau Jr to lead FFLB. After EBA, FDR consolidated federal farm financing into <italic>Farm Credit Administration</italic> (\u201cFCA\u201d) under Morgenthau. For Deputy Governor of FCA, FDR appointed his wife\u2019s uncle, William Morgs, a broker who descended from Elder John Strong.\nIn late March 1933, stockholders filed suits for receivership of <italic>Detroit Bankers Co</italic> and <italic>Guardian</italic> BHCs, while RFC and UST appointed conservators and arranged for <italic>General </italic><italic>Motor</italic>, <italic>Chrysler</italic><italic> Motor</italic>, and <italic>Ford</italic> <italic>Motor</italic> to underwrite stock for depositors and stockholders, leading to the formation of NB<italic> of Detroit</italic>. Soon after, <italic>Guardian</italic> and several banks were merged into the newly formed <italic>Manufacturers</italic> NB <italic>of Detroit</italic> with investment from <italic>Ford</italic> and RFC and advice from <italic>First Security</italic>\u2019s Eccles clan.\nMeanwhile, <italic>title and mortgage insurance companies</italic> (\u201cTICs\u201d) survived the real estate and NYSE downturn because of geographic diversification and account substitution. TICs paid investors out of corporate accounts since they lacked legal instruments to reorganize creditor payouts. Then in March, New York\u2019s regulators required them to make investment payouts using only income. For the first time, these firms suspended payments and debilitated investors. By April, FDR used EBA authority to take America off the gold standard. He ordered individuals and corporations to deposit gold coins and certificates above a $100 exemption. \nWhile FRS Governor Eugene Meyer steered Hoover\u2019s emergency measures, he resigned from FDR\u2019s Administration by May. Since Baptist deacon Eugene Black Sr became President of <italic>Atlanta Trust Co</italic> and Governor of FRS <italic>Atlanta</italic>, FDR appointed Black as FRS Governor after Meyer. While Eugene\u2019s Heller brother-in-law kinterlinked with <italic>Anglo-California Bank</italic>\u2019s Fleishhackers since 1919, <italic>OIL</italic> California invested in <italic>Anglo-California Bank</italic> in 1933 and the Fleishhackers broker their kinterlink with the Hellers soon after.\nFor Secretary of Labor, FDR promoted Boston Brahmin-cousin Francis Perkins from head of <italic>State Industrial Commissioner</italic> to the first female Cabinet member from 1933. As she extended her policies from New York nationally, she soon had her hands full. Supporting Joseph Kennedy, the <italic>Anheuser</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Busch</italic> family, and Canadian Bronfmans, FDR kept his campaign promise to end Prohibition, and thus stimulated the \u2018official\u2019 economy and raising taxes away from the illegal bootleggers.\nAs the Court reinterpreted <italic>Munn</italic>-set PU rates from \u2018forecast reproduction\u2019 to \u2018non-confiscatory\u2019 on May 8th, Congress sought to stabilize farms with the <italic>Emergency Farm Act</italic> (\u201cEFA\u201d) on the 12th. EFA liquidated JSLBs, paid farmers to not grow\u2014favoring<italic> </italic>America\u2019s South relative to Puerto Rico and other colonies, and allowed UST to set the <italic>dollar</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> gold to UST debt ratio. \nBy the 18th, FDR signed bill for the  (\u201cTVA\u201d) to federally dam the Tennessee River for hydroelectricity and electrify the South under the direction of David Lilienthal. While waiting for the Court to opine, Lilienthal created the <italic>Electric Home & Farm Authority</italic> to subsidize and stimulate consumer purchases of electric appliances\u2014primarily refrigerators, ranges, and hot water heaters\u2014and forge a political economy of mass consumption. \nAfter Chicago\u2019s <italic>Illinois</italic> LIC failed in 1933, her Chair Raymond Stevens and his father, who had the founded the LIC, were tried for embezzlement. As his father died, Stevens committed suicide, but his son-in-law, George Champion, returned to <italic>Chase</italic> as second VP. Following the failure of <italic>Illinois</italic> LIC, auditors revalued other LIC real estate. As the multi-state Black-led <italic>Supreme</italic>\u2019s assets dropped in half, bankruptcy seemed likely with minimal funds and profits. \n<italic>Supreme</italic>\u2019s Counsel Earl Dickerson\u2019s plan of uncertain legality had policyholders sign liens for half of their policy reserves. Despite later prohibition, Illinois\u2019 Court validated these liens as assets, aided by Dickerson, also Illinois\u2019 assistant attorney general.  By then, after dozens of Black-owned banks shuttered since 1930, only eight survived the <italic>Dust Bowl</italic> trauma. With two in Philadelphia, these other banks were in Nashville, Atlanta, Newport News, Durham, Charleston, and Richmond, where Maggie Walker\u2019s bank thrived for decades after her death in 1934.\nBy October, Congress chartered the<italic> Commodity Credit Corp </italic>(\u201cCCC\u201d) to guarantee crop profits. And, the same day as EFA, the<italic> </italic> (\u201cEMA\u201d) reduced municipal tax burdens with RFC grant transfers for public work housing and other services. Despite EMA, New York City negotiated with banks through 1933 to roll over increasingly expensive debt. \nSince WWI, Julius Cohen Based on British public benefit corporations that pioneered as counsel for America\u2019s first <italic>authority</italic>\u2014<italic>Port Authority of New York & New Jersey</italic>\u2014innovated multipurpose, inter-jurisdictional construction from 1916. However, <italic>Port Authority </italic>remained unique until RFC and EMA, as <italic>authorities</italic> financed self-liquidating projects by issuing tax-exempt bonds that RFC discounted. As off-balance-sheet entities, <italic>authorities</italic> were not subject to constitutional public debt limits. By 1931, Governor FDR appointed Cohen Vice Chair and Counsel of <italic>Saint-Lawrence Water Power Commission</italic>. Representing <italic>Hoover Dam</italic> contractors since 1930, California\u2019s <italic>Heller Ehrman </italic>law firm worked with RFC, Congress, and California to finance <italic>Golden Gate Bridge</italic>.<italic> </italic>(Still, developers asked <italic>TransAmerica</italic> to buy a large chunk).\nWhile the Depression squeezed many stocks and IHCs, <italic>Atlas</italic> and <italic>DuPont</italic>\u2019s IHC remained solid. In April 1933, <italic>Atlas </italic>gained control of <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s IHC after a minority investment the previous year, which became the nucleus for her IHC system. Since Rockefeller-in-law Marcellus Hartley Dodge\u2019s <italic>Remington Rand</italic> sold her cash register division to <italic>National Cash Register Co</italic> in 1931, he sold her rifle business to chemical giant <italic>DuPont</italic> in May. Within days, Congress introduced federal securities law.\nAs Congress attributed the growth of Kreuger\u2019s IHC to financial misreporting, they adopted the inaugural , based on the 1929 British mandate for security issuers to certify financial reports. <italic>Sullivan </italic>partner Arthur Dean, a member of FDR\u2019s anti-Wall Street \u2018Brain Trust\u2019, helped to draft SA1933 in a single weekend. Initially opposed, Dean guided the drafters to ensuring a truthful presentation of securities. SA1933 established new regulations for issuing stocks and bonds to the public, requiring full and fair disclosure of securities\u2019 character to prevent fraud. \nDean\u2019s experience in preparing registration statements allowed him to argue against undue emphasis on historical aspects to prevent burying important facts in irrelevant detail. Per Dean, SA1933 required counsel opinions, ensuring lawyers continued to play an important role in securities issuance and compliance. Initial drafts of SA1933 excluded municipal bonds, small firms, and over-the-counter traded securities. However, the latter was eventually deleted while the others were retained.\nSo, the trend to publicly traded securities markets that grew in the 1920s collapsed. While <italic>Lehman</italic> helped PUs and others sell SA1933-exempt private debt to LICs, failure rates were steady. As contracts continued to have gold clauses, Congress nullified such obligations on June 5. Within days Eaton\u2019s <italic>Continental </italic>IHC defaulted on collateral loans. Only Insull\u2019s bankruptcy was larger. NYSE soon required Cyrus Eaton\u2019s Cleveland bank <italic>Otis</italic> to sell herself to <italic>Pierce</italic>.\nAfter Eaton fought Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic> from merging with <italic>Youngstown</italic>, Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Chase</italic> NB auctioned much of Eaton\u2019s collateral with <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s aid.  Leaving <italic>Chase</italic> NB in 1934, Charles McCain became President of Eaton\u2019s <italic>United Light & Power Co </italic>PUHC, as <italic>OIL</italic>-in-law and <italic>Dillon</italic> banker Paul Nitze became a director of<italic> United Light</italic>\u2019s principal subsidiary. While the Mellons also had large interests in<italic> United Light</italic>, <italic>Rockefeller</italic> yielded <italic>Bethlehem Steel </italic>to <italic>Morgan </italic>and Mellon interests after Percy Rockefeller died in 1934. So, Percy\u2019s uncle, John Rockefeller Jr, set up trusts with oil stocks and real estate, which made up most of his family\u2019s fortune into the 21st century. Meanwhile, <italic>Chase</italic> director Eugene Rensselaer Thayer served as receiver for Insull\u2019s <italic>Mississippi Valley </italic>PUHC.\nOn the 13th, Congress empowered FHS to charter and regulate federal <italic>savings and loans</italic> (\u201cS&Ls\u201d). Ohio, Michigan, and Chicago B&L SBs with similar structures converted to refinance and discount mortgages with FHS. Although securities affiliates raised bank solvency and liquidity,  forced separation of the two activities on June 16, as <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s Winthrop Aldrich had lobbied. While this was a goal of FA1913, Midwest securities firms\u2014Eaton and <italic>Stuart</italic>\u2014and Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Chase </italic>aligned with <italic>Morgan</italic>. Per FA1933, <italic>Chase</italic> and her <italic>American Express </italic>affiliate sold their stake in <italic>Corn Exchange Bank Trust </italic>(\u201cCEBT\u201d)\u2014which <italic>Chase</italic> had acquired before Rockefeller took over\u2014to <italic>Lehman</italic>, which had founded CEBT\u2019s predecessor in 1873\u2014to disperse broadly. \n<italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, and <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic> were among the few to remain NBs, their securities financiers left to found independent firms. When <italic>Chase</italic> dissolved <italic>Harris Forbes</italic>, Eugene Black Jr chose to join <italic>Chase</italic> NB in New York, where he oversaw sales across 8 Southern states. As former EVP formed <italic>Starkweather</italic> and <italic>Moseley</italic> acquired <italic>Harris Forbes</italic>\u2019 eastern division\u2014including part of operations in Chicago, Saint-Louis, Indianapolis, and Louisville\u2014and became <italic>Starkweather</italic>\u2019s Middle Western correspondent. \nAs <italic>Seligman</italic> formed <italic>Union Securities</italic>, <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic> split into the private bank <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic> and two securities firms. While <italic>Alex.Brown</italic> focused on Baltimore, <italic>Harriman Ripley</italic> incorporated in New York<italic>,</italic> led by former <italic>JG White</italic> engineer Joseph Ripley<italic> Morgan </italic>alongside <italic>Citi</italic> New York\u2019s interests. <italic>Citi</italic> California\u2019s investment bankers joined <italic>Blyth.</italic> Similarly, as <italic>Morgan </italic>remained a commercial NB, John Morgan\u2019s grandson Henry Morgan joined Harold Stanley, brother-in-law of Christian <italic>Kuhn </italic>partner Hugh Knowlton, in splitting off and forming <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> to focus on securities in New York. \nWhile <italic>Drexel</italic> formed in Philadelphia, Grenfell and Smyth cousins out of London of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> took over <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s non-American holdings. Although <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> floated the Indian branch, <italic>Yule Catto</italic>, Vivian Smyth remained a director of both and worked closely with Catto when he later became a director of BOE. John Morgan\u2019s grandnephew William Burns Harcourt served as Managing Director and Chair of <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> from the 1930s to 1968. Thomas Catto\u2019s son Stephen followed his father into <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> in 1948. Likewise, relations among the other <italic>Morgan </italic>entities remained strong. \nThe dissolution of<italic> Guaranty Trust</italic> affected 500 employees. Joseph Swan, Burnett Walker, Irving Fish, and Ritchie Kimball joined <italic>Smith</italic> as partners, along with thirteen junior officers. John Harrison joined <italic>Lazard</italic>, Frederick Moore joined <italic>Kidder</italic>, and John Patterson joined <italic>Blyth</italic>. Alfred Shriver joined <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> in 1936, and John Wright moved to <italic>Drysdale</italic>. The remaining staff either managed the liquidation, joined the <italic>Guaranty</italic> NB, or moved to other firms. By June 1934, <italic>Smith</italic> included 15 general partners, 3 special partners, and 522 employees, 237 of whom were from <italic>Guaranty</italic>.\u2018\nAs some former <italic>Harris Forbes</italic> securities staff joined those of <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic> to form <italic>First Boston </italic>under the leadership of <italic>Harris Forbes </italic>Boston\u2019s John Macomber. Since <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic> and <italic>Chase</italic> securities financiers spun out to form <italic>First Boston</italic> after FA1933, <italic>First Boston</italic> took care of <italic>Rockefeller</italic>\u2019s Latin American interests. Likewise, <italic>Rockefeller</italic> combined their interests with <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic>\u2019s<italic> Stone Webster</italic>\u2019s investment banking and Southern PU and natural gas assets. \nWhile Allan Pope became President of <italic>First Boston</italic>, his brother Bayard became Chair of Upstate New York-focused <italic>Marine Midland</italic> BHC. In 1937, Allan\u2019s son married Elizabeth Truslow, whose second cousin Henry had kinterlinked with <italic>OIL</italic> co-founders Auchincloss. Henry\u2019s son led <italic>Ponemah Mills</italic> in Connecticut and served as a director of <italic>Chelsea Savings Bank</italic>. \nAllan Pope also became a director of <italic>First Boston</italic> London. Since fleeing from Berlin after working for <italic>Wassermann</italic>, <italic>Kuhn-</italic>heir Joseph Loeb\u2019s stepson joined <italic>First Boston</italic> London as Chair, while remaining a partner at <italic>Michelis\u00a0</italic>in Zurich. Robert Boothby was another partner, The son of a <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic> director, grand-nephew of former BOE Governor Cunliffe, and a second cousin of a Baring, Boothby had been a Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill\u2019s private secretary. That year, Bootby married a Cavendish, whose second cousin once removed was <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Brand. \nIn July 1934, Philip Lehman and his son Robert resigned from the board of <italic>Corn Exchange Bank Trust</italic> after FRS denied their requests to remain directors. While the new legislation compelled Frank Altschul to resign as a director of <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York discontinued marketing acceptances and travelers\u2019 letters of credit. By 1936, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York had stock distribution offices in Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia. \nAs Altschul became Chair of <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s underwriting and securities issuance unit, most other officers were Christians. Newly hired from <italic>Citi</italic>, Iowa-born Stanley Russell became President and Montana-born James Jackson and Scottish-born John Fisher, alongside New York-born George Ramsey, from <italic>Harris Forbes</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>First Boston</italic>, and New Jersey-born John Harrison, from <italic>Guaranty</italic>, joining Burr, McGrath, and Perrin hired from <italic>Guaranty</italic> in the 1920s. Furthermore, Randolph Compton connected <italic>Lazard</italic> to Saint-Louis municipal bond business <italic>Compton</italic>, run by his father, and <italic>Raltson Purina</italic>, founded by his father-in-law William Danforth.\nThe resignations of Altschul, Lehman, Seligman, and other Jewish securities financiers from commercial banks had the effect of virtually eliminating Jews from banks, insurers, and large companies until the deregulation of the 1980s, when Protestant <italic>Morgan </italic>NB and other banks, securities firms, and law firms began hiring Jews and other minorities. Only 16% of the 919 NYSE members and 55 out of 637 listed firms were Jewish. Jews were virtually absent in large insurance management, with Herman Behrens and JB Levison as notable exceptions\nIn 1933, NYCH had 420 listed directors among its 19 members, with only 30 Jews. Major banks such as <italic>Bank of New York</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>, <italic>Hanover</italic>, <italic>First </italic>NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>New York</italic>, <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, and <italic>New York Trust</italic> did not have any Jewish directors. Of New York banks, Jews only had limited positions at <italic>Commercial NB & </italic><italic>Trust</italic> and <italic>Public</italic> NB <italic>& Trust</italic>. Jewish securities financiers also had limited representation. Of the foreign loans outstanding in 1935, Christian <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Dillon</italic>, <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>First Boston</italic>, <italic>Guaranty</italic>, <italic>TransAmerica</italic> <italic>Blair</italic>, and <italic>Lee Higginson</italic> each surpassed the highest-ranking Jewish house, <italic>Kuhn</italic>. \n<italic>Kuhn</italic> predominantly had Christian-born active partners, including William Wiseman, George Bovenizer, Hugh Knowlton, and Elisha Walk. Since the death and retirement of Seligmans, Christians Earle Bailie and Francis Randolph shared control of <italic>Seligman</italic> New York with Frederick Strauss. Since Strauss married John Morgan\u2019s Christian extended cousin, his daughter wed Victor Knauth, a Christian cousin-in-law of <italic>Lee Higginson</italic> London\u2019s Thomas McKittrick, in 1931. Likewise, <italic>Lehman</italic> hired Mississippi-born Wickliffe Shreve, an extended cousin of the <italic>Riggs</italic>, <italic>Colgate</italic>, and Auchincloss families.\nFA1933 exempted NBs from state usury laws and extended FRS\u2019 jurisdiction to BHC voting shares, control over MMSEC, and bank deposit rates via <italic>Reg Q</italic>. Replacing stockholder double-liability with <italic>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp</italic> (\u201cFDIC\u201d), FA1933 instructed RFC to buy NB preferred shares. By then, <italic>First Security</italic> BHC\u2019s Elbert Bennett relocated from Utah to DC as one of appointees selected to aid in establishing FDIC and assess the solvency of thousands of banks nationwide, determining their eligibility for FDIC membership. \nWithout a central bank, British Canada supported cartels and banned unit banks. Despite generally insolvent banks and cities, no depositor ran. Ontario\u2014with public telephony and PU\u2014had more defaults than Quebec. Likewise, Mysore with public PUs, was insolvent by 1929 in British India, but Bombay defaulted after Britain\u2019s 1931 suspension. \nOn the same day in June as FA1933, Congress enacted . For years, the Court prevented industrial mergers under a <italic>per se</italic> interpretation of AA1890 per AA1914. Soon after FDR\u2019s inauguration, the Court adopted a <italic>rule of reason</italic> approach, which allowed firms in ailing industries to merge in 1930. When cheap oil-fueled trucks reduced railroad traffic, coal prices fell as PUHCs substituted coal with gas. West Virginia joined neighboring states to cartelize coal operations against ruinous competition. The most efficient system, <italic>COALB</italic>, founded by FDR\u2019s grandfather, filed for receivership as <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s Rockefeller\u2014<italic>COALB</italic>\u2019s controlling shareholder\u2014abandoned coal in 1932. \nDays after Germany\u2019s <italic>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</italic> restarted the supra-national steel cartel, America\u2019s Court allowed coal cartelization to stabilize prices in March 1933. With advocacy from Gerald Swope of GE for corporate socialism, Congress cartelized other industries and unionized labor with TA1933. FDR appointed Averell Harriman to chair of the New York implementation of the operation.\nSince <italic>OIL </italic>interests integrated with pipes dominated fuel transport, TA1933 endorsed pipe divestment. However, FDR\u2019s Interior Secretary, Harold Ickes, allowed them to cartelize under TA1933 to mitigate gas burning. From 1933 through 1972, <italic>Texas Railroad Commission</italic> (\u201cTRC\u201d) regulated oil trade to serve as a swing producer. Since Saudi Arabia annexed the Kingdom of Hejaz, debts mounted as the Depression declined Mecca pilgrimage revenues. In 1933, Saudi Arabia signed an agreement with <italic>OIL of California</italic> over <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> to control oil exploration and exports. \nBy increasing taxes, TA1933 revived the capital stock tax repealed in 1926, thus lowering debt expenses relative to equity but prevented tax write-downs above normal depreciation. As strikes grew, FDR created the <italic>National Labor Board</italic> by executive order to oversee wages based on his WWI-era, coal unions extended to vertically integrated captive coal mines by 1934. Also, on June 16th, the <italic>Emergency Railroad Act</italic> (\u201cERA\u201d) created regional railroad cartels with elected coordinating committees. ERA extended ICC\u2019s oversight to RHCs with the ability to force reorgs by blocking RFC loans. But as prices grew without competition, the economy shrank. \nTA1933 tasked the <italic>Investment Bankers Association</italic> (\u201cIBA\u201d), the only national securities trade association, to develop a code for the new industry post FA1933 and SA1933. IBA formed the <italic>Investment Bankers Code Committee</italic> (\u201cIBCC\u201d) with 24 members from firms in 15 cities to consult with security dealers, accountants, lawyers, and government officials. While registration under the code was voluntary, its rules applied to all investment bankers, prohibiting registered securities dealers from participating in syndicates or selling groups with unregistered dealers. \nIn November, FDR signed the code into law and over two thousand investment houses joined. Irish Baptist George Bovenizer\u2014<italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s first non-Jewish partner and father-in-law of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York\u2019s Gerald Donovan, Percy Stillman Rockefeller\u2019s partner and later co-founder of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> <italic>Rockefeller</italic>\u2014became IBA\u2019s Chair alongside Vice Chair John Harrison, who joined <italic>Lazard</italic> New York from <italic>Guaranty</italic> that year.\nAlso in November, FDR appointed Henry Morgenthau Jr as acting UST Secretary. The placement became permanent the following January and Morgenthau remained UST Secretary until FDR died in 1945. As Morgenthau became the first Jewish UST Secretary (and only Jew in FDR\u2019s Cabinet), FRS assumed responsibility for the gold-purchase program from RFC on January 16. By month end, Congress granted the president the necessary authority to reduce the gold content of the <italic>dollar</italic>, which FDR devalued from $20 to 35 while UST maintained a monopoly on nationalized gold. \nWhile FRS Chair Eugene Black Sr influenced the securities acts, he resigned after 15 months in August 1934 and returned to his former position as Governor of FRS <italic>Atlanta</italic> several months before dying of a heart attack. Since <italic>First Security</italic> BHC\u2019s Elbert Bennett in 1933, <italic>First Security</italic> CEO Marriner Eccles transformed from a Republican into a deficit spending advocate. After appointing Eccles Special Assistant to the Secretary of UST in 1934, FDR designated him as FRS Chair to replace Black by November.\nWhile <italic>Morgan </italic>Partner Russell Leffingwell supported FDR\u2019s decisions regarding gold and securities, the son-in-law of Philadelphia-based <italic>Morgan </italic>Partner Edward Stotesbury joined the DuPont, Colgate, and many other wealthy families in funding <italic>Liberty League</italic>, which temporarily sought to replace FDR with a military dictator. Other bankers bonded via marriage and cross-hiring. \nAlthough <italic>Morgan</italic>-ally George Baker died in 1931, his family continued to control <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic><italic> </italic>and ally with <italic>Morgan</italic>. After Baker\u2019s grandchildren married Katharine Delano Price\u2014FDR\u2019s cousin\u2014in 1917,  Robert Berwind Strawbridge\u2014whose uncles collaborated with <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>and aunt married a Harjes of the original <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris partnership\u2014in 1931, and, the following year, a daughter of George Baker II, who had inherited the partnership, married Thomas Tailer Jr. Tailer was born to <italic>Brown</italic> heiress Harriet Brown and New York banker Thomas Neufville Tailer, whose deceased former wife, tobacco-heiress Maude Lorillard, had married Cecil Baring. By May 1934, another of Baker II\u2019s daughters married <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s John Schiff, heir to senior partnership. \nIn 1936, Harriet married <italic>Blair</italic>\u2019s Ledyard Blair, five years after his wife died. The same year, Ledyard\u2019s niece married Maude\u2019s cousin once removed. In 1936, George Baker\u2019s great-granddaughter\u2014a first cousin of FDR\u2014married Angier Biddle Duke, a descendant of Anthony Drexel.  By 1938, divorcee George Baker II married Frances Paul Munn, a descendant of Anthony Drexel and <italic>Drexel</italic> partner James Paul, whose sister was married to Viscount Astor. Likewise, married John Fell\u2014whose father descended from Anthony Drexel, mother a Randolph, and step-father was former UST Secretary Ogden Livingston Mills under President Hoover\u2014joined <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1937 and was admitted to partnership three years later.\nLikewise, <italic>Citi</italic> hired Robert Hoguet, a graduate of <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business who had worked at RFC. From an old French family, his father headed New York\u2019s <italic>Emigrant Savings Bank</italic>\u2014by then the largest savings bank in America\u2014and his mother was a niece-in-law of Perry Belmont. Also in 1934, a Rockefeller married a Converse descendant and extended Morgan cousin, reinforcing linkage with <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>. Other financial and industrial heirs formed their own firms. By 1935, William McCormick Blair of Chicago\u2014more closely related to the Rockefellers than East Coast <italic>Blair</italic> cousins by this generation\u2014formed Chicago broker <italic>William Blair</italic>.\nMeanwhile, TICs grew more insolvent, and still had no access to bankruptcy regimes. So, in August, New York allowed the state insurance regulator to merge TICs with the <italic>Schackno Act</italic>. While this would bail out investors in the weaker firms, the state court held that <italic>Schackno </italic>unconstitutionally impaired contracts. By early 1934, the Court condoned state moratoria for private debt. As credit disappeared, UST seized FRS\u2019 gold and issued debt in January. \nBy executive order in February, FDR established the <italic>Export-Import Bank</italic> to grant direct loans to exporters and guarantee private credits for export sales (\u201cECGD\u201d), like Britain\u2019s from 1916, to supplement private credit and compete with foreign officially supported export financing. After extending <italic>Munn</italic>\u2019s specific industries to allow states to set fair market returns, the Court eliminated specificity to include all public interest cases in March in line with TA1933. While this decision sanctioned <italic>Schackno</italic>, many states outlawed TICs. \nOn May 10, with , Congress limited tax-free reorgs to mergers and technical insolvency. Moreover, TA1934 prohibited non-railroad consolidated reporting and revoked spinoff, foreign dividend, and NOC-transferring sell-off tax benefits. TA1934 taxed capital gains held for less than two years at 80%, falling to 30% after a decade. By months end, Congress extended BA1933 to municipalities, forcing creditors to reorg debt. \nA week later,  created <italic>Securities & Exchange Commission</italic> (\u201cSEC\u201d) to enforce SA1933, significantly extending federal powers relative to British regulation. SA1934 mandated the filing of annual audited financial statements for all publicly traded securities. Participating in the drafting, Arthur Dean helped establish a self-regulating system for the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) traded securities with regional IBCC branch supervision. \nMoreover, SA1934 bestowed control of security collateralized credit margins to FRS to control MMSEC. To establish SEC\u2019s foundation, FDR appointed Joseph Kennedy as Chair to prevent the type of stock market manipulation that made him wealthy. Some securities firms struck, allowing others to take up the business. The impact of SEC regulations has been mixed. \nOn the one hand, odd-lot trading increased, indicating greater confidence among small investors in common stocks as investment vehicles. However, insiders benefited more than outsiders. Additionally, SEC may have excluded new companies from the market since it was used more frequently in the 1920s than in the 1950s. While SEC protected the public from price manipulation and excessive bank credit diversion, it impaired stock exchanges liquidity, thereby decreasing trading volume and caused stock prices to become more discontinuous.\nThe next day,  extended BA1933\u2019s reorgs to all corporations, replacing equity receiverships. As BA1934 protected collateral pledges by unifying receiver jurisdictions and prohibiting short-term debt enjoinment, the Court deemed pledges part of the estate. While BA1926 had turned receiverships into bankruptcy, BA1934 allowed reorgs without receivership. As BA1934 depressed merger and debt markets, TA1934 taxed reorgs with business changes. As <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic> liquidated her control-less mutual fund IHC, <italic>Atlas </italic>shifted from IHCs and PUs to reorg debt in return for minority stakes with <italic>Lehman</italic>. Since banks lost management oversight, companies turned to <italic>McKinsey</italic> and other consultants for organizational advice without credit.\nIn 1933, <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>\u2019s Richard Hoyt became President of <italic>Aviation Securities </italic>IHC, affiliated with Clement Keys\u2019 <italic>North American Aviation</italic>. Since 1930, Postmaster General Walter Brown orchestrated the merger of <italic>Aviation Corp</italic>\u2019s <italic>Pan Am</italic> and her biggest airmail competitor, <italic>New York, Rio, & Buenos Aires Airlines</italic>, doubling <italic>Pan Am</italic>\u2019s fleet and secured the profitable South American airmail contract. In 1931, <italic>Aviation Corp</italic>, led by <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Harriman</italic>, merged various smaller airlines into <italic>American Airways</italic>. By 1933, however, <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Harriman</italic> lost control of <italic>Aviation Corp </italic>in a stock battle to automotive gambler Errett Cord. That year, a Senate inquiry scrutinized the airmail contracts awarded through non-competitive processes. \nOn February 19, 1934, FDR canceled all domestic airmail contracts, transferring the service to the Army Air Corps. Having resigned from <italic>Paramount</italic>\u2019s directorate in 1933, John Hertz bought a <italic>Lehman</italic> partnership, and negotiated the purchase of <italic>Trans-continental & Western Airlines</italic> (\u201cTWA\u201d) with <italic>Atlas</italic>. By June, however, <italic>Airmail Act </italic>separated manufacturing and transport in aviation, prohibiting airline HCs from owning airline stocks, and mandated competitive bidding for airmail routes. \nBy 1935, <italic>American Airways</italic>, TWA, and other airlines changed their corporate structures to comply with new regulations, with <italic>Lehman</italic> losing control of the latter. Permanently enjoined by a federal court in 1937, Cord sold <italic>Aviation Corp</italic> and other interests to a former associate and a banking group including <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> <italic>Rockefeller </italic>and<italic> Emanuel</italic>, a mixed-religion firm, including the Jewish Frederick Heimerdinger, whose father-in-law was a member of <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic> and cousin once removed, Henry Necarsulmer, who joined <italic>Kuhn</italic> in 1935.\nSimilarly, the <italic> </italic>extended AT&T\u2019s monopoly\u2014with long-distance rates subsidizing local rates\u2014and formalized <italic>Stuart</italic>\u2019s movie studio self-moderation. Since RCA and <italic>Fox</italic> battled the exclusive movie theater sound system licenses AT&T\u2019s <italic>Western Electric</italic> controlled since 1927, the two privately settled, giving studios operational freedom in 1935.<italic> </italic>While <italic>Chase</italic> NB<italic> </italic>already dominated MGM\u2019s parent <italic>Loew</italic> and, with<italic> Atlas</italic>, <italic>Fox</italic>, <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Atlas</italic> bought part of RCA\u2019s interest in RKO which filed for bankruptcy under BA1934. Likewise, <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Atlas</italic> reorged <italic>Paramount</italic>, pushing out <italic>Kuhn</italic> in June 1935. <italic>Lehman</italic> also formed a joined venture with Giannini-banked <italic>Columbia</italic>. French vertically integrated film corporations, <italic>Gaumont</italic> and <italic>Path\u00e9</italic>, had collapsed by then.\nThe same month, Congress replaced the <italic>Smoot-Hawley</italic> tariff with reciprocity agreements to restore trade, imbued FRS with emergency bank lending powers with FA1934,<italic></italic> and the <italic>Silver Act</italic> backed the <italic>dollar</italic> with massive silver purchases from China and elsewhere the same day. By the end of June, the <italic>Frazier-Lemke Act</italic>, combined bankruptcy with states\u2019 agricultural moratoria. And as depositors ran from S&Ls to FDIC-ensured banks, Congress ensured FHS deposits with <italic>Federal S&L Insurance Corp</italic> (\u201cFSLIC\u201d). \nSince enacting EMA to support municipal budgets, FDR appointed his uncle Frederic Delano as Chair of <italic>National Resources Planning Board</italic> in 1934, a position he held until 1943. In New York, Robert Moses\u2019 <italic>authorities</italic> funded the nation\u2019s largest public works. Since Moses rivaled him, FDR secretly threatened New York Governor Herbert Lehman he would withhold EMA funds unless he fired Moses. Public opinion thwarted this attempt. \nBanks stopped competing for deposits since FRS fixed deposit rates with FA1933 in <italic>Reg Q</italic>. After building high reserves of monetized UST bonds, surviving banks no longer traded FRS reserves. Instead, as deposits returned after the bank holiday, banks substituted forbidden interest payments with discounted correspondent services using the <italic>inter-bank deposit money market</italic> (\u201cMMIBD\u201d). These excess reserves grew after UST revalued the <italic>dollar</italic>, and gold inflows from Europe accelerated as Nazi Germany rearmed in violation of the <italic>Versailles Treaty</italic>. \nIn early 1935, the Court supported gold clause nullity. However, conservative justices invalidated the <italic>Railway Pension Act</italic>, Ickes\u2019 oil refining cartel (and the rest of TA1933\u2019s state wage and price controls), the agricultural <italic>Frazier-Lemke Act</italic>, and a presidential decision to fire an FTC member in late May. While Congress amended the <italic>Frazier-Lemke Act</italic>, she enacted a federal coal cartel to fix prices at higher wages and extended ICC oversight to trucks to protect railroads from ruinous competition. And for <italic>LABOR</italic> wage earners, the <italic> </italic>(\u201cNLRA\u201d) sanctioned collective bargaining unions. Finally, as railroads and labor agreed on dismissal payouts, Congress allowed 1933\u2019s ERA to expire to reduce ICC\u2019s railroad cartel power.\nNLRA also established the <italic>National Labor Relations Board</italic> (\u201cNLRB\u201d) to enforce NLRA rules. For the first NLRB Chair, FDR appointed Smith-supporter Francis Biddle. While his brother was a Philadelphia investment banker, Francis married an extended cousin of <italic>Morton</italic>\u2019s George Bliss, and became a lawyer like his father, which he returned to after a year at NLRB. While his mother descended from the first Attorney General John Randolph, Francis\u2019 forefather wed Gideon Cornell\u2019s daughter. Francis\u2019 fifth cousin Anthony Drexel Biddle\u2014a direct descendant of SBUS\u2019 Nicholas Biddle and <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Anthony Drexel\u2014married a <italic>Newmont</italic> heiress. In 1935, FDR appointed, Anthony as Ambassador to Norway and then other European countries.\nEarlier, their cousin George Drexel Biddle had married Louis Kaufman\u2019s daughter<italic> </italic>after the <italic>Panic of 1925</italic>. While Kaufman focused on his family\u2019s Michigan iron interests after he sold <italic>Chatham Phenix</italic> NB to <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Rockefeller</italic> led <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> in 1932, his daughter wed Richardson Dilworth. Since Dilworth\u2019s grandfather founded a Pittsburgh steel mill, the company affiliated with Eaton\u2019s <italic>Republic Steel</italic> while the family kinterlinked with the Carnegies, and through them related to <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic>\u2019s Rockefellers. Likewise, an extended cousin of Biddle-in-law Horatio Lloyd of <italic>Drexel</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic>, Henry Wingate was a <italic>Sullivan</italic> lawyer from 1929 until joining <italic>NICKEL</italic> as Assistant Secretary in 1935. Together, the family bonds eased competition of banking and mining interests to accommodate laborers.\nEFA\u2019s requirement for the president to declare a state of emergency to manage the <italic>dollar</italic> made less sense considering inflationary goals. As FRS raised deposit rates, she sought to control MMIBD. From EFA, Congress shifted authority to FRS with . With FRS Governor Eccles\u2019 guidance, FA1935 tied FOMC decisions and centralized FRS authority in the UST-dominated Board rather than autonomous District Banks.\nWith the FRS Governor replacing the UST Secretary as FRS Chair, Eccles replaced Morgenthau, and no Jew headed FRS until the 1970s. Since FA1913, only reserves held at FRS counted, and FA1935 empowered FRS to set the level. While FA1935 allowed banks to net reserves of MMIBD, deposits were gross, so all parties had to pay FDIC premia. To promote soundness, FA1935 restricted banks\u2019 investments to investment-grade bonds and\u2014like nonbank reorgs\u2014replaced insolvency with illiquidity. \nSimilarly,  promoted tax-exempt UST and municipal bonds with progressive income tax up to 70% for the wealthiest. As the  reduced municipal welfare liabilities with grants for pensions and aid to poor children, the <italic>Emergency Relief Act of 1935</italic>, Congress refocused EMA municipal assistance into the <italic>Public Works Administration</italic> to finance public works and lend on revenue bond collateral. \nWhile EMA financed rural electrification and drainage in 1933 along the lines of TVA, the projects may have altered groundwater reserves around Kansas. Moreover, the prevalence of small farms limited private solutions to control the <italic>Dust Bowl</italic>\u2019s wind erosion. Using <italic>Emergency Relief </italic>financing, FDR alleviated <italic>Dust Bowl </italic>conditions and further squeezed SGE by chartering <italic>Rural Electrification Authority</italic> (\u201cREA\u201d) by executive order in 1936. \nREA organized farm cooperative wiring loans to power irrigation against drought.  To administer REA, FDR appointed <italic>Bonbright</italic><italic> </italic>brother-in-law Morris Cook. Since Sidney Mitch had resigned from SGE in 1933, his son led <italic>Bonbright</italic>. After PUHCs lost their suits against the socialist competition, cheap energy negated soil conservation, electrification and EFA spurred sharecroppers to consolidate. \nTA1935 limited HCs\u2019 intercorporate dividend deductibility. And the inaugural <italic>PUHC Act</italic> (\u201c\u201d) extended the <italic>Federal Power Commission</italic>\u2019s (\u201cFPC\u201d) jurisdiction beyond hydroelectricity to regulating inter-state PUHC rates that the Court had prevented states from doing with <italic>Attleboro </italic>in 1927. PA1935 authorized SEC to reorganize them in and outside of bankruptcy and increased financing costs by preventing PUHCs from issuing HC bonds and interlocking directorates with creditors. \nPA1935 tasked SEC to prohibit vertical integration with fuel and disassemble incontiguous systems that had diversified risks. The brunt fell on SGE, <italic>United</italic>, and <italic>Associated</italic>. <italic>Associated</italic>\u2019s Hopson was likely the source for the extremity of this \u2018<italic>Death Sentence.</italic>\u2019 After abusing investors and forcing debt reorgs in 1932, he dodged Congressional subpoenas, but died in a sanitarium after prison. SEC sued to dissolve SGE, but did not enforce PA1935 until the Court\u2019s ruling. SGE and PUHCs fought dissolution until losing in 1937\u2014spurring PUHC registrations\u2014and on the \u2018<italic>Death Sentence</italic>\u2019 requirement in 1946. So,<italic> Kidder</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York advised PU divestments and capital raises. \nSince the Court declared TA1933 unconstitutional, investment banks continued to follow IBCC\u2019s code. While some regional dealers sought to continue at a state level, almost 3000 preferred federal supervision. So, IBCC reorganized informally into the <italic>Investment Bankers Conference</italic> (\u201cIBC\u201d) in October 1935. Working with SEC and securities dealers, IBC established uniform fair practice rules for OTC. \nLikewise, SEC codified NYSE\u2019s 1931 rule to ban \u2018demoralizing\u2019 short trades to 16 exchanges. Using her SA1934 powers, FRS increased the NYSE collateral margin in early 1936 and imposed flat fees to prevent 1929-type runs to securities in April. And, using her FA1935 power in July, FRS increased required reserves effective October. UST issued bonds to sterilize gold inflows from December rather than gold certificates to FRS. \nBy yearend, FDR promoted his distant cousin Preston Delano to be a Governor of FHLB. Since supporting the <italic>New Deal</italic>, James Loeb Warburg broke with FDR by 1936, arguing that FDR\u2019s policies could lead to dictatorship. Likewise, the Court held 1933 EFA farm controls, 1934 municipal reorgs, and 1935 coal cartel as unconstitutional as it was not <italic>commerce</italic>. \nHowever, the Court supported FDR\u2019s TVA and other federal energy monopolies in inter-state sales. Having settled 1919\u2019s debate, TVA expropriated SGE and <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s assets and encouraged large municipalities to switch to cheaper TVA services, thus depriving private PUHCs of cross-subsidization. With this regionalized use of Federal socialism, TVA remained a political issue and fell behind private interests. As <italic>Triborough Bridge</italic> <italic>Authority</italic> opened in 1936, Moses hired to <italic>Dillon</italic> fundraise instead of his <italic>Kuhn</italic> cousins. \nWhile Congress replaced the unconstitutional EFA with the  to regulate agricultural futures,  raised revenues for social security payouts. To spur investment by reduce surplus cash that fueled MMIBD, TA1936 targeted monopolies with an undistributed profits tax and intercorporate dividends. Unlike TA1934, TA1936 taxed out-of-court, nonfinancial debt reorgs. \nMoreover, TA1936 split IHCs that mixed control with investment from control-less, payout tax-exempt, SEC-regulated mutual funds. Since TA1936 increased the cost of retained earnings, corporations paid dividends and ran to the capital markets. One of these, <italic>A</italic><italic>tlas</italic>, consolidated HC assets after TA1936. As FRS and UST tightened MMIBD, New York banks sold securities to repay loans. But as SA1933 and FA1935 locked middle-market firms out of the capital markets, they contracted investment.\nThe same week as TA1936, Congress amended AA1914 against ruinous competition from chain stores. Against state chain taxes, AA1936 proxied TA1933\u2019s small business protection by federalizing states\u2019 inflationary resale price maintenance. Like bank reform spurred banker marriages, the daughter of <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s founder married a <italic>Safeway</italic> heir. \nAs economists blamed cartels for the economic malaise, DOJ indicted oil majors\u2014that Ickes cartelized per TA1933\u2014of price-fixing under a <italic>per se</italic> reading of AA1890. But DOJ first sued <italic>ALUM</italic>. With trucking under ICC regulation, the Court allowed state railroad commissions to restrict fuel competition rather than burn gas. And as technology advances unlocked oil in Illinois, oil prices collapsed by late 1937 before conservation laws. So, as coal inflated grew relative to oil, industry reoriented towards cheaper oil.\nWorrying about judicial review, FDR asked Congress to empower him to \u2018pack\u2019 the Court in early 1937. And as bills circulated, the Court upheld the 1935 <italic>National Labor Relations Act</italic>\u2019s collective bargaining as constitutional by adding manufacturing to the canals, railroads, and telephony covered under the <italic>Constitution</italic>\u2019s <italic>Commerce Clause</italic>. Legalized collective bargaining led to unprecedented \u2018sit downs\u2019\u2014although more workers walked out in 1919\u2014as unions formed across industries. \nAlthough Congress minimized strikes by re-cartelizing coal, she omitted vertically integrated captives, and so only those sat down. However, this law did extend to Harlan, Kentucky, which had evaded unions by institutionalizing brutality. As coalers starved, law enforcers and courts leased Black prisoner labor to collieries and the Ku Klux Clan lynched organizers. These strikes line up most with triggering the <italic>Panic of 1937</italic>. Indeed, the Court outlawed the <italic>Labor Relations Act</italic>\u2019s \u2018sit down\u2019 strikes in 1939. \nWith credit and supply chains interrupted, shopkeepers faced the wrath of consumers. Since discrimination closed off most employment other than retail, Jewish entrepreneurs started grocery stores and clothing shops. With Black entrepreneurs discriminated by bankers, Black consumers could not get credit at Black shops or chains like A&P. In 1938, Chicago\u2019s Black Bronzeville neighborhood experienced an organized antisemitic campaign led by the newspaper<italic> </italic><italic>Dynamite</italic>, accusing Jews of trying to dominate Negro institutions, exploiting as merchants, and suggesting their expulsion. This led to heightened tensions, prompting discussions between Black and Jewish leaders and labor union representatives, leading the editor of <italic>Dynamite</italic> to cease further attacks. With fewer Jews in New Orleans, Italian merchants were targeted.\nOne securities firm that benefited was founded by Jay Cooke\u2019s son-in-law, <italic>Barney</italic>, in the 1890s. Around the same time, Edward Smith founded <italic>Smith</italic> in Philadelphia. At the start of the 1920s, <italic>Smith</italic> banked IT&T until the latter became too politically complicated and <italic>Morgan </italic>took over. After <italic>Farnum</italic> <italic>Winter</italic> failed in 1932, <italic>Barney</italic> hired Wallace Winter to branch to Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Saint-Paul. <italic>Smith</italic> benefited from FA1933 as most of <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>\u2019s securities staff joined <italic>Smith</italic> in 1934, particularly in Chicago, Pittsburgh, and London. Following the expansion, <italic>Smith</italic> faced a cash shortage during the <italic>Panic of 1937</italic>, leading her to merge with <italic>Barney</italic> to form <italic>Smith Barney</italic>.\nSince DuPont and other wealthy families funded <italic>Liberty League</italic>, and temporarily sought to replace FDR with a military dictator in 1934, Ethel DuPont wed FDR\u2019s son in June 1937. As UST desterilized gold purchases to rebuild bank reserves. Likewise, FRS reduced reserve requirements and NYSE collateral margins. FDR\u2019s coalition redefined banking and securities for decades. UST and FRS switched from requiring banks to account for all securities at market value to carrying debt at historical cost. \nSEC also adopted this reporting for corporations to prevent PUHC-like earnings inflation. Replacing the NYSE-inspired \u2018demoralizing\u2019 trades ban, SEC restricted short sales. For OTC registration and regulation, SA1938 established a self-regulation, allowing IBC to reorg into the <italic>National Association of Securities Dealers</italic> (\u201cNASD\u201d). Like TA1933, NASD maintained democratic procedures and regional autonomy. \nAfter <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s stockbroker Richard Whitney resisted federal regulation as President of NYSE, a SEC mandated audit uncovered his embezzlement and leading to his imprisonment in 1938. His brother George continued to lead <italic>Morgan </italic>NB. While former <italic>Cravath</italic> lawyer, <italic>Morgan </italic>partner Seymour Gilbert\u2019s brother wed Helen Homans, the granddaughter of Boston Brahmin Adams (and so a cousin-in-law of the Morgans), Seymour died in 1938, and his widow married <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Harold Stanley. \nWithin a year, <italic>Morgan </italic>NB hired <italic>Davis Polk</italic> partner Henry Alexander (unrelated to the other Alexanders) and two <italic>Royal Bank of Canada </italic>financiers, one of whom was with <italic>Morgan</italic> since 1925. Since Alfred Shriver left <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>for <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley </italic>after FA1933, he became partner after his brother-in-law Robert Rouse left <italic>Guaranty</italic> NB in 1939 to head FRS <italic>New York</italic>\u2019s Open Market Account, supervising UST debt purchases for two decades. Rouse replaced Randolph Burgess, who had resigned to become Vice Chair of <italic>Citi</italic> NB.\nTA1938 repealed TA1936\u2019s undistributed profit tax but taxed capital stock until 1945. And as FRS allowed MMIBD, Congress authorized banks to net reporting for FDIC premia. As quickly as the economy collapsed from in 1937, it recovered to trend three years after hitting a low in May 1938. However, defaults grew until 1940. In late 1938, FDR promoted his distant cousin Preston Delano from FHLB Governor to oversee NBs as UST\u2019s OCC Comptroller. Delano held the office for 14 years, a record that remained into the 21st century. In 1940, Delano approved FRS Chair Marriner Stoddard Eccles\u2019 cousin Howard Stoddard to merge six Michigan banks into <italic>Michigan</italic> NB.\nAs America joined the supra-national steel cartel to mutually recognize exclusive spheres of influence in 1938, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Mellon</italic>, and <italic>Smith Barney</italic> led 112 banks in in the largest bond financing since SA1933 for<italic> Bethlehem Steel</italic> by 1940. Since neither banks nor PUHCs could sell directly to consumers, <italic>Merrill</italic> extended their experience in taking chain stores public since the 1920s to become a \u2018department store-like\u2019 broker to the masses. By the 1950s, <italic>Safeway</italic> was America\u2019s second largest food chain and the first to mass circulate magazines.\nStill, FDR shifted from undistributed profits tax to antitrust against BHCs and resale price maintenance to shield small businesses. Reversing TA1933 cartels, DOJ litigated price-fixing. Although the Court supported DOJ against oil majors by holding price-fixing <italic>per se</italic> illegal in 1940,<italic> </italic>New York\u2019s Federal court found <italic>ALUM</italic> innocent, and the technology helped America win WWII. While banking regulations breaking interlinking bank directorates forced <italic>ALUM</italic>\u2019s Richard Mellon to yield his presidency of <italic>Forbes NB</italic> of Pittsburgh in 1940, James Bovard\u2014a brother in-law of <italic>Mellon</italic> NB\u2019s Frank Denton\u2014became President. By 1942, Bovard married a former sister-in-law of FDR\u2019s son.\nBut as the Court supported the <italic>New Deal</italic>, Congress limited gas competition by adding inter-state natural gas pipes to FPC\u2019s jurisdiction and reinstated municipal bankruptcy law, advanced urban public housing, and conferred FHLB-like powers to <italic>Federal Farm Mortgage Corp</italic>. Finally, she added the <italic>Civil Aeronautics Board</italic> to other inflationary federal agencies protecting cartels and labor unions. \nWhile Congress rejected FDR\u2019s bid to reorganize agency tribunals into an executive department or abolish them in 1938, she compromised authority with the <italic>Administrative Procedure Act</italic> for transparency and accountability after FDR\u2019s death. In practice, the President\u2019s party controlled the agencies. However, FRS remained independent outside of <italic>Administrative</italic>\u2019s purview. \n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Post-WWII Banking</italic>\nSuing Insull on Chicago\u2019s behalf in WWI, Donald Richberg, a Tennessee-born Jew, counseled the rail union. Calling for reforms in the 1922 struck, Richberg hired David Lilienthal per Professor Felix Frankfurter. By 1930, erstwhile Baptist minister, socialist Leland Olds led New York\u2019s<italic> Power Commission</italic> after changing PU rates from fair market returns to inflation-unadjusted historic investment with Governor FDR. Although FDR claimed victory for public damming of the Saint-Lawrence River in 1930, decades passed without any construction. \nWhen FDR won the Presidency, Richberg drafted TA1932 and union laws, Lilienthal led TVA (1933), and Frankfurter joined the Court (1939). Since enacting EMA to fund municipalities, FDR appointed his uncle Frederic Delano as Chair of <italic>National Resources Planning Board</italic> in 1934, a position he held until 1943. (Three years later, FDR appointed Delano\u2019s son-in-law and extended <italic>Morgan </italic>cousin, James Peabody Houghteling, Commissioner of Immigration & Naturalization. In 1940, Houghteling became a special assistant to the UST Secretary until 1947.) \nAs Olds and FDR created REA to wire farm co-ops, Congress added inter-state gas pipes to FPC\u2019s orbit in 1938, and FDR appointed Olds to head FPC in 1939. Firms burned gas as Olds capped out-of-state gas profits to limit oil and coal competition. While protecting collieries and railroads from gas, Olds rallied federal subsidies and tax-exempt REA loans to out compete private PUs and consolidate farms. \nStill, FDR faced opposition from <italic>Kuhn</italic>-cousin Robert Moses. <italic>Port Authority of New York & New Jersey</italic> of 1921 was unique until RFC. As public benefit corporations,<italic> Authorities</italic> issued tax-exempt bonds that RFC discounted (by herself issuing tax-exempt debt.) <italic>Authorities</italic>\u2014off-balance-sheet entities\u2014allowed states to develop within constitutional debt limits. Moses led the largest <italic>authority</italic> by innovating <italic>authorities</italic> to finance open-ended activities instead of single projects. \nHence, <italic>Triborough Bridge & Tunnel Authority</italic> (\u201cTBTA\u201d) constructed and operated toll bridges, -roads, and hydroelectric dams. As Moses\u2019 TBTA funded the nation\u2019s largest public works, FDR secretly threatened New York Governor Herbert Lehman he would withhold EMA funds unless he fired Moses. Public opinion thwarted this attempt. When the Court allowed PA1935 to split PUIHCs, <italic>Niagara Falls</italic> became the world\u2019s largest private hydroelectric station. Unlike <italic>Niagara</italic>, TBTA did not remit tolls to cities or the state governments, handicapping mass transit and other public spending. While off-balance sheet financing removed TBTA from politics, corrupt deals spurred construction.\nAs FRS considered borrowing excessive and limited discounts after the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, banks started the <italic>FRS funds money market</italic> (\u201cMMFR\u201d) by trading FRS reserves. After exterminating the 19th century NYSE collateral money market, Congress monetized UST bonds, and banks accumulated large reserves of this debt. Since FA1933\u2019s <italic>Reg Q</italic> banned interest rate competition, banks discounted correspondent services in the <italic>inter-bank deposit money market</italic> (\u201cMMIBD\u201d). Empowered by FA1935 to control the reserve ratio, FRS squashed MMIBD in the <italic>Panic of 1937</italic>. \nDuring this recession, Congress followed FA1933 and TA1936 with  in splitting the Wall Street-driven equity receivership into equity and SEC-overseen reorgs. As with PUHCs since 1935, SEC oversaw reorgs of listed corporations to prevent minority creditor holdouts. Like TA1936, BA1938 privileged only the latter with tax benefits. Although <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Dean helped draft BA1938, creditors lost control over corporate governance in an era of entrenched management as BA1938 combined with FA1933. \nFDR balanced his extended banking cousins with federal appointments. While Nicholas Biddle was a director of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, <italic>Niagara</italic>, and <italic>Niagara Junction </italic>RR until his death in 1923, his second cousin once removed Monoure Biddle traded PU stocks as investment banker in the 1920s. During the <italic>Depression</italic>, FDR appointed Monoure\u2019s brother lawyer Francis as Chair of <italic>National Labor Review Board</italic>. \nAlthough he soon resigned, Francis became a director of FRS <italic>Philadelphia</italic> in 1938, and then a federal appeals judge and Chief Counsel of TVA through 1939. (Another new FRS <italic>Philadelphia</italic> director was Thomas McCabe, a Delaware banker\u2019s son and CEO of <italic>Scott Paper</italic> of Pennsylvania.) By 1940, FDR appointed Francis to oversee immigration and naturalization as Solicitor General and then Attorney General in 1941 (like Francis\u2019 ancestor John Randolph had been during President Washington\u2019s administration.)\nSince the Court deemed 1933 controls unconstitutional, FDR tried taxing undistributed profits with TA1936. However, he blamed TA1936 for accelerating concentration by firms with access to the capital markets. In 1938, he funded antitrust enforcement against BHCs, general price-fixing, and inflationary resale price maintenance. Similarly, he extended social security<italic> </italic>benefits to surviving dependents and formed the<italic> Labor Department </italic>to enforce<italic> </italic>standardized fair wages and work weeks. \nWhile the Court found price-fixing per se illegal, Europe\u2019s war mooted this decision. As UST accelerated inflation by monetizing UST contracts, FRS shifted from controlling inflation to fueling fiscal dominance by purchasing UST bonds to cap UST\u2019s rates, monetizing UST bonds, and driving bank excess reserves. After renovating the <italic>Civil War</italic>-era <italic>Fort Knox</italic>, UST transferred less than $4 billion of New York gold the first half of 1937. From July 1940, the first of 45 trains moved another shipment worth $9 billion into the depository.\nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1937</italic>, Congress chartered <italic>Fannie Mae</italic> as an RFC branch to create a secondary market for Federally underwritten residential mortgages. While <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s stockbroker Richard Whitney had resisted federal regulation as President of NYSE, a SEC mandated audit uncovered his embezzlement and leading to his imprisonment in 1938. His brother George continued to lead <italic>Morgan</italic>. To regulate IHCs, SEC introduced measures such as registration, conflict of interest prevention, and shareholder rights, with a focus on investment banking arrangements, but such agency discretionary power faced opposition. \nWith support from Congress and <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s Arthur Bunker, <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Alfred Jaretzki Jr and Arthur Dean negotiated the <italic>Investment Co Act of 1940</italic> (\u201cSA1940\u201d). SA1940 codified TA1936\u2019s tax on IHCs that controlled investments, forcing<italic> Atlas </italic>to<italic> </italic>split into a mutual fund and a conglomerate. As <italic>Morgan </italic>NB incorporated in 1940 under President George Whitney with Russell Leffingwell as Vice Chair, and Henry Davison Jr and Henry Alexander as directors. While <italic>Davis Polk </italic>partner Joseph Auchincloss served as counsel to <italic>Morgan</italic>, his son graduated <italic>Yale</italic> and joined <italic>Sullivan</italic>.\nBefore America entered the war, the only Jew in FDR\u2019s Cabinet and a cousin-in-law of <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Altschul, UST Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr led America\u2019s aircraft program and championed military aid to Britain from 1939. As America entered the war, UST Secretary Morgenthau spearheaded the war bond program, largely bypassing Wall Street and relying on patriotism.\nAs America entered WWII, FDR issued executive orders to freeze crude oil and direct FRS to control credit. While Congress spurred WWI investments with accelerated depreciation in TA1916 through TA1921, they lifted the many restrictions with TA1940 for WWII. Under RFC, Congress created the<italic> Defense Plant Corp </italic>to directly invest in business. While FDR tapped <italic>Atlas</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> founder, Floyd Odlum, to run defense contracts, he soon resigned as large contractors refused to subcontract. \nSo, FDR tapped GE\u2019s CEO, Charles Wilson, to direct the <italic>War Production Board</italic> and mobilize 100,000 aircraft, along with <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Weinberg, SGE\u2019s Curtis Caldran, and <italic>State Street</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Paul Cabot. While Gordon Rentschler served as Chair of <italic>Citi</italic> from 1940, his brother Frederick and extended Rockefeller cousin-in-law led <italic>United Aircraft Corp</italic>, manufacturing helicopters and half of all piston engines. While Rockefeller-in-law Marcellus Hartley Dodge sold much of <italic>Remington Arms </italic>to <italic>DuPont</italic> in 1933, Ethel DuPont wed FDR\u2019s son in June 1937, and <italic>DuPont</italic>\u2019s business boomed.\nHaving remained in the reserves after WWI, <italic>Dillon</italic> VP William Draper Jr was recalled in May 1940, and assigned to the War Department General Staff as a colonel. Working on the President\u2019s Advisory Committee on Selective Service and in the Morale Branch, Draper headed the welfare and recreation division, and later as assistant chief of the branch. FDR dependence on <italic>Dillon</italic> and <italic>Harriman</italic> instead of <italic>Morgan</italic>, propelled the bankers into the government sphere. Charles McCain\u2014former President of <italic>Chase</italic> NB and <italic>United Light & </italic><italic>Power Co</italic>\u2014became a Partner of <italic>Dillon</italic> in 1939 and President from 1940 as FDR appointed <italic>Dillon</italic> President James Forrestal Undersecretary of the Navy, he promoted them to Defense Secretary to Undersecretary of State. \nForrestal selected <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Lewis Strauss-Darmstadt as his special assistant, representing the Navy on the <italic>Inter-departmental Committee on Atomic Energy</italic>. (While Strauss-Darmstadt, John Schiff, and Benjamin Buttenwieser served in the Navy and Frederick Warburg taught at Army Special Services, <italic>Kuhn</italic> was left with only Christian partners, including Gilbert Kahn, George Bovenizer, William Wiseman, Hugh Knowlton, and Elisha Walk, with the addition of Percy Stewart and Robert Brown in 1941.) \nForrestal also recruited <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s Paul Nitze, Douglas Dillon, and August Belmont IV. Nitze assisted the Allies and worked on various government projects, which launched his government career. After sending Averell Harriman to Moscow in connection the lend-lease supply collateral program, FDR appointed him Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Since Ferdinand Eberstadt resigned from <italic>Dillon </italic>in 1931, he remained friendly with Forrestal, and became Vice-Chair of <italic>War Production Board</italic>, breaking the raw materials logjam via the <italic>Controlled Materials Plan</italic> in 1942. \nFDR also appointed Averell Harriman\u2019s widowed cousin-in-law, Florence Jaffray Hurst, as minister to Norway in 1937 through WWII. <italic>Harriman Ripley</italic> partner Joseph Ripley helped operate helped operate Philadelphia\u2019s <italic>Cramp Shipyards</italic>. From 1940, <italic>Brown Harriman</italic> partner Robert Lovett\u2014and in-law of the Brown family\u2014became Assistant Secretary of War for Air.  While <italic>Chase</italic> Chair Winthrop Aldrich headed <italic>Allied Relief Fund</italic>, <italic>Chase</italic> SVP Eugene Black Jr directed New York\u2019s Victory Bond Committee and War Finance Investment Division Committee, and <italic>Morgan </italic>NB partner Henry Alexander served as Vice Chair of War<italic> </italic>Department\u2019s Strategic Bombing Survey, planning the air war from the Pacific to Europe.\nFor Secretary of War, FDR reappointed Henry Stimson, John Morgan\u2019s former lawyer and Secretary of War under President Taft. Stimson\u2019s third cousin once removed had married Harris Livermore, who led Averell Harriman\u2019s <italic>United American Shipper</italic>. After FDR established a committee to study the threat of Nazi propaganda in late 1940. Stimson warned of its dangers to American freedoms, while Assistant Secretary John McCloy advocated for mobilizing propaganda as a countermeasure. Philadelphia-born McCloy, raised by his nurse mother after his father\u2019s death, graduated from <italic>Amherst College</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law by 1921. After five years with <italic>Cadwalader</italic>, he moved to <italic>Cravath</italic>, where he became a partner.\nBy then, McCloy married Ellen Zinsser, whose grandfather immigrated from Baden in 1849 and founded a chemical and dye business. Her cousin, John Zinsser, president of the Philadelphia pharmaceutical firm <italic>Sharp Dohme</italic>, married Joyce Knowlton of Brookline, Massachusetts. Joyce\u2019s brother, Hugh, worked at <italic>International Acceptance Bank </italic>and became a <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner in 1933 and married the sister of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Harold Stanley. McCloy\u2019s prominence drew Stimson\u2019s attention, leading to his appointment as Assistant Secretary of War in 1941, where he presided over the internment of Japanese descendants in detention centers.\nAnother Zinsser sister married Lewis Douglas in 1921. Douglas was born in Bisbee, Arizona, where his father worked with <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>, served as President of <italic>Bank of Bisbee</italic> and <italic>Bank of Douglas</italic>, and later presided over <italic>United Verde Extension Mining Co</italic>. After graduating from <italic>Amherst College</italic>, Lewis served in WWI and then entered politics, serving in the Arizona Legislature and Congress. In 1933, FDR appointed him Director of the Budget, but Lewis resigned in 1934 due to disagreements. During WWII, he took on the role of Deputy Chief of the War Shipping Administration while his brother rose at <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>. \nIn early 1941, Robert Sherwood\u2014a second cousin once removed of John Morgan\u2019s Hamilton son-in-law and a relative of the Blair family\u2014called for American intervention against Germany. His efforts gained support from Allen Dulles, Dean Acheson, and Paul Loeb Warburg. To counter Nazi propaganda, Sherwood established what became <italic>Office of War Information</italic>, appointing Warburg as his deputy in July 1941. By late 1942, John Zinsser had joined <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s board.\nAlso in July 1941, FDR created <italic>Office of the Coordinator of Information</italic> (\u201cCOI\u201d) and appointed William Donovan, a decorated WWI veteran and founder of the law firm <italic>Donovan Leisure</italic>, to lead it. After a 1940 mission to Britain, Donovan became a strong advocate for America. involvement in the war. The COI, tasked with intelligence gathering and psychological warfare, was reorganized into <italic>Office of Strategic Services</italic> (\u201cOSS\u201d) in June 1942. Under Donovan\u2019s leadership, OSS conducted espionage, sabotage, and guerrilla warfare in Europe and Asia.\nAmong OSS personnel were anti-Bolshevik Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s, many of whom were descendants of the fallen nobility. Serge Obolensky\u2014a former officer in the Imperial Russian Army, who married an Astor and became a hotel baron in New York\u2014played a significant role in OSS operations, including working with the French Maquis during the Normandy invasion. Likewise, the son of a family of wealthy Russian landlords decorated by the Tsar, New York banker Andre Smolianinoff oversaw recruiting in Yugoslavia and married William Averell\u2019s second cousin once removed in 1943.\nSince Valerian Lada-Mocarski directed <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York alongside <italic>Sullivan </italic>partner Allen Dulles, his brother married Olivia Loomis\u2014whose father was a former President of <italic>Lehigh Valley</italic> RR and sister was married to a Schieffelin, a cousin of the Vanderbilt, Morgan, and Roosevelt families\u2014in 1940. Within a year, Lada-Mocarski resigned to serve OSS on intelligence operations in Cairo, Italy, France, and Lugano. When based in Switzerland as Counsel alongside Dulles, Lada-Mocarski networked with IT&T and negotiated with German businesses. Dulles also collaborated with <italic>Stinnes</italic> invested <italic>Becker</italic> Berlin\u2019s Irving Sherman.\nOSS did recruit a diverse range of personnel from various sectors, including a VP from <italic>International</italic> RR <italic>of Central America</italic>, linked to <italic>United Fruit Co</italic>, who led the Secret Intelligence Branch, and a VP from <italic>Republic Steel</italic>, who directed the Morale Operations Branch. Donovan\u2019s law firm, <italic>Donovan Leisure</italic>, contributed attorneys who took part in diplomatic missions to places such as Thailand and Yugoslavia. \nWhile the Rockefellers were not directly involved in OSS, Nelson Rockefeller led the separate <italic>Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs</italic>, resulting in tensions with Donovan over responsibilities in Latin America. Still, <italic>OIL</italic> monitored Axis oil shipments in Spain and Switzerland. Likewise, Edward Watjen\u2014whose father was <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>\u2019s Berlin representative and sister married a Rockefeller\u2014worked with Donovan in Switzerland.\n<italic>Paramount Pictures</italic> financed espionage activities in Finland and Sweden. <italic>Goldman </italic>was involved in financing the resistance in North Africa, and Donovan personally authorized Sidney Weinberg to gather intelligence in the Soviet Union. Other prominent families were well-represented within OSS. Paul Mellon served as an administrative officer of the Special Operations Branch in London, while his sister married the OSS Chief in London. Lester Armour, formerly with <italic>Harris</italic> SB in Chicago, served as the last OSS commander in London. Douglas Dillon, who initially worked behind a desk in Washington, joined OSS under Donovan\u2019s direction after serving as a decoding officer in New York. Charles Bay, an AM Kidder partner and leader at Bay Petroleum, became a high-ranking OSS official.\nJohn Morgan\u2019s sons, Junius and Henry, played key roles. Junius directed clandestine funds from London, while Henry oversaw the Censorship and Documents Branch. Since fleeing to America with his father and Nelson Jay, <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris Senior Partner John Carter, in 1940, Bernard re-enlisted in the Army in 1942, serving on General Patton\u2019s staff and participated in campaigns in North Africa and Europe. While Jay served in the Red Cross, Bernard joined at OSS, and, after his father died, took control of <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris with Jay as Chair.\nAnd TA1942 monetized UST bonds by applying the same treatment to banks\u2019 debt investments. To keep UST borrowing rates low, FRS lent funds on UST bond collateral using repurchase agreements (\u201crepos\u201d) and exempted UST deposits from reserve requirements. So, banks traded UST bonds to meet reserves instead of MMFR. As Congress introduced rent control in 1942, investors ran from rentals to mortgages. (Where such units remained for decades, as in New York City, rent controlled apartments continued to be passed on within families without regards to salary or social welfare, like with union jobs.) \nWith TA1942, Congress extended BA1938 reorg tax benefits and NOC transfers. In addition, TA1942 eased capital gains and allowed businesses to deduct depreciable asset losses. Mergers resumed, mostly smaller firms competing with government contractors. With increased consolidation, thinking evolved. Although the Court expanded the definition of the <italic>Constitution</italic>\u2019s <italic>Commerce Clause</italic> to include <italic>manufacturing</italic> after FDR\u2019s court-packing incident in 1937, they excluded <italic>finance</italic>. As a result, these were outside of FTC\u2019s jurisdiction until the Court deemed insurance was <italic>commerce</italic> in 1944. \nNear the end of WWII, UST Secretary Morgenthau engineered the <italic>Bretton Woods</italic> Conference in 1944, which established the <italic>dollar</italic> as the world\u2019s reserve currency. While <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Dean Acheson and FRS Chair Marriner Eccles also represented America, other leaders including Britain\u2019s Robert Brand, France\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Istel, Belgium\u2019s Camille Gutt of SG <italic>Belge</italic> and <italic>Solvay</italic>\u2019s Ren\u00e9 Bo\u00ebl, Iran\u2019s Abol Ebtehaj of <italic>Melli</italic>, China\u2019s HH Kung and TL Soong, and India\u2019s <italic>Reserve Bank of India</italic> Governor Chintaan Dwarakanath Deshmukh, Ramasamy Chetty, and <italic>Tata</italic>\u2019s Ardeshir Shroff. \nThe <italic>Bretton Woods</italic> agreement between America and her Allies in Europe and Asia replaced the British <italic>pound</italic> sterling as the world\u2019s reserve currency with America\u2019s <italic>dollar</italic>. In return, Europe and East Asia relinquished their colonial endeavors and entrusted their defense and external security to America through NATO in the West and bilateral treaties in the East. \nWhile <italic>Bretton </italic>signatories pegged their currencies to America\u2019s <italic>dollar</italic> by 1946\u2014which pegged to gold\u2014most currencies remained unconvertible. According to Morgenthau, the new monetary system sought to \u2018<italic>limit the control which certain private bankers have in the past exercised over international finance [and drive] the usurious money lenders from the temple of international finance</italic>\u201d and stabilize the value of labor. To facilitate fixed FX,<italic> </italic><italic>Bretton </italic>created <italic>International Monetary Fund</italic><italic> </italic>(\u201cIMF\u201d)\u2014under the leadership of Camille Gutt\u2014and<italic> World Bank</italic> (\u201c<italic>BANK</italic>\u201d)\u2014under<italic> </italic><italic>Lazard</italic> scion Eugene Meyer<italic>.</italic> \nAfter <italic>Lehman</italic> associate Alex Sachs helped Albert Einstein arouse FDR\u2019s interest in nuclear fission in 1939, German research spurred Congress to finance nuclear energy weaponization in 1941. However, Japan became the target in 1944 and FDR ordered the attack to end WWII. By 1946, Bernard Baruch, Ferdinand Eberstadt, and Lehman\u2019s first non-family and non-Jewish partner, John Hancock, drafted the first <italic>United Nations</italic> <italic>Atomic Energy Commission </italic>plan. That year, as Congress established the <italic>Atomic Energy Commission</italic> (\u201cAEC\u201d), President Harry Truman appointed then-head of TVA, John Lilienthal, as Chair.\nBut nuclear energy faced competition from legacy sources. While George Humphrey joined <italic>COALH</italic> in 1920, his brother wed banker Benjamin Strong\u2019s daughter in 1924, reinforcing <italic>COALH</italic>\u2019s kinterlink with <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> since the daughter of Marcus Converse Hanna, a fifth cousin of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>\u2019s Edmund Converse, wed a son of William Moore, cofounder of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> and <italic>STEEL</italic>, in 1909. As Humphrey fused with other firms, he separated <italic>COALH</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>steel and coal activities and created<italic> National Steel </italic>by 1929, Humphrey\u2019s daughter wed a Hanna in 1939. By 1942, as WWII increased coal demand, <italic>COALH</italic> acquired <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s <italic>COALB</italic> from, which <italic>Rockefeller</italic> had put into receivership in 1932. \nSince federal coal controls set minimum prices and re-routed supplies by industry and region, large coalers, PUs, and industrial consumers lobbied Congress to dissolve the program by 1943. So, <italic>COALH</italic> bought Mellon\u2019s <italic>Pittsburg Coal</italic> in 1945, becoming the nation\u2019s largest colliery. As oil replaced coal, America had sufficient reserves, but allowed oil royalty tax-write offs to develop Saudi Arabia and Iran for Europe. Since FDR agreed not to aid Israel, Saudi Arabia joined TRC to stabilize prices in 1945. <italic>Shell</italic> retained a dual-identity since the turn of the century, with <italic>Royal Dutch</italic> owning 60%, and <italic>Rothchild</italic> London and <italic>Samuel </italic>being large investors in <italic>Shell</italic>. \nLike <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>United</italic> PUIHC kept out natural gas from competing with coal until PA1935, <italic>New Deal</italic> protected railroad, coal, and labor from oil and gas competition, and Georgia antitrust blocked <italic>Shell</italic> oil pipes from New Orleans via Tennessee. Since meeting President FDR in 1937, Texan oil magnates Sid Richardson and his nephew Perry Bass funded Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 1940. \nWhen Curtis Dall\u2014formerly of <italic>Lehman</italic> and FDR\u2019s son-in-law\u2014<italic>Tennessee Gas Transmission</italic> to bring natural gas from Southwest Louisiana and Eastern Texas to the Appalachian area, he faced opposition from railroad and coal interests, <italic>LABOR</italic>, and <italic>OIL</italic> of New Jersey.  However, after German submarines sank tankers in 1941, FDR used eminent to build oil pipes through states, and Congress ordered RFC to subsidize Southwest oil pipes to the East. Increasingly, <italic>Shell</italic> Americanized. Against coal protest, UST sold oil pipes after WWII to Democratic supporters and contractors in Texas\u2014mainly George Brown\u2014who converted oil pipes to transport natural gas via <italic>Texas Eastern Transmission</italic>. \nAlthough<italic> Chase</italic> NB became the world\u2019s largest bank since merging with <italic>Rockefeller</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> LIC in 1930, she lost that title. Supplanted by <italic>Rockefeller</italic>\u2019s Winthrop Aldrich after FA1933, <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s long-time Chair Albert Wiggin retired in 1933. But as <italic>TransAmerica</italic> surpassed her in 1946, Wiggin blocked Rockefeller\u2019s attempt to expand <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s minority interest in <italic>American Express</italic>. Conditioning the sale of his <italic>American Express</italic> shares, Wiggin ensured that <italic>Chase</italic> would not get them. So, <italic>Chase</italic> expanded globally, hiring BIS President Thomas McKittrick in 1946, and promoting him to SVP soon after. Second only to was second to <italic>TransAmerica</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic> also promoted within the family, including James Stillman Rockefeller and James Perkins\u2019 son Richard.\nSince <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic> and <italic>Chase</italic> securities financiers spun out to form <italic>First Boston</italic> after FA1933, <italic>First Boston</italic> took care of <italic>Rockefeller</italic>\u2019s Latin American interests. Likewise, <italic>Rockefeller</italic> combined their interests with <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic>\u2019s<italic> Stone Webster</italic> investment banking and Southern PU and natural gas assets. While the Adams family and their Boston Brahmin cousins of Massachusetts dominated <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Henry Morgan had married the daughter of CF Adams, a descendent of two presidents and director of AT&T and multiple banks, in 1923. \nAs Henry Morgan joined <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, his brother-in-law, Charles Adams IV, rose from President of military contractor <italic>Raytheon </italic>in 1948, to Chair from 1960 until 1975. Adamses also directed <italic>Sheraton</italic> hotels.  <italic>Morgan</italic> also interlinked other military interests. In 1954, <italic>Morgan</italic> hired <italic>Yale</italic> graduate Rodney Wagner, whose forefathers held influential roles across Missouri law, politics, and banking since the 1840s. While he soon left to serve in the <italic>Korea War</italic> for two years, he returned and married a Maine banker\u2019s daughter connected to shipbuilder <italic>Bath Iron Works</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Russell Forbes</italic>-descendant Allan Forbes was President of <italic>State Street Trust</italic> since 1911, <italic>State Street Trust Co</italic> merged with <italic>Union Trust Co</italic> in 1936, and Charles Adams became Chair of the bank. After Adams retired in 1950, Forbes took over as Chair, and oversaw a merger with <italic>Second</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> shortly before dying in 1955. Since Boston Brahmin and Henry Morgan\u2019s brother-in-law via the Converse family, Paul Cabot created America\u2019s first and largest mutual fund, <italic>State Street Investment Corp</italic>, the fund held <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s PUs and other interests. \nPaul\u2019s cousin Thomas Cabot, director of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s<italic> United</italic> PUIHC\u2019s Boston PU since PA1935, continued to leading <italic>Cabot</italic> petrochemicals until his son took over. <italic>Cabot</italic> executives later led <italic>State Street.</italic> Since PA1935 limited financial director interlocks, <italic>Morgan </italic>split directors of PUs in New York and New Jersey with affiliates. While <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> syndicated many of the debt placements, they competed with <italic>First Boston</italic> for stock.\nIn 1886, Boston was the headquarters for chemical engineers <italic>Griffin Little</italic> established in Boston by Arthur Little and Roger Griffin. After Griffin\u2019s death in a laboratory accident in 1893, Little continued and made advances in papermaking and motion picture film. Little found another partner, but he left to join MIT. Incorporating as <italic>Arthur Little</italic> in 1909, <italic>Arthur Little</italic> survived beyond Little\u2019s death in 1935 with MIT owning a majority stake as dozens of faculty supplemented incomes by consulting at the nearby facility.\nArthur raised his nephew Royal Little. After his father\u2019s death and his mother\u2019s remarriage to a Boston Brahmin outcast, Royal Little joined his uncle to attend private schools and eventually study chemical engineering at <italic>Harvard</italic>. Introduced to the rayon industry by his uncle, he started his career in textiles, merging his company with <italic>Franklin Rayon Dyeing</italic> in 1928. However, he faced investment challenges before the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic>. Royal later founded the <italic>Chemical Products Corp</italic>. With rayon gaining popularity in the postwar era, he borrowed funds to create <italic>Special Yarns</italic> and rebranded into <italic>Textron</italic> in 1943. Their Lowell cousins oversaw <italic>Boston Safe Deposit & Trust </italic>and its parent HC, <italic>Boston Co</italic>, used Massachusetts trust law to become America\u2019s largest nonbank.\nThe Boston Brahmin came together as Overseers of <italic>Harvard</italic>. But conditions began changing since <italic>Harvard</italic> President Lawrence Lowell instigated a 15% Jewish quota and advocated immigration restrictions after WWI. Following WWII, there was a shift in the expansion of higher education, scholarships, and federal military grants removed some barriers. Since introducing quotas against Jews and other minorities to cater to old-stock Protestants in the 1920s, private universities like <italic>Harvard</italic>, <italic>Yale</italic>, and <italic>Princeton</italic> began diversifying students. \nSince his ancestors co-founded <italic>Bank of Rhode Island</italic> in 1795 and his father became President of <italic>American Exchange </italic>NB in 1894, Lewis Clarke inherited the latter office upon his father\u2019s death. Over the decades, his responsibilities grew to include <italic>Irving Trust</italic> (which fused with <italic>American Exchange </italic>NB), <italic>Bowery Savings Bank</italic>, <italic>Park Sheraton Hotel</italic>, <italic>Alamo Petroleum Co</italic>, <italic>Rosario Exploration Co</italic>, and <italic>Shell</italic> until his death in 1964. \nWhile Boston artist Frederic Crowninshield served as Director of <italic>American Academy </italic>in Rome at the turn of the century, his son Frank joined Cond\u00e9 Nast as the editor of <italic>Vanity Fair</italic> from 1914 and, after <italic>Vanity Fair</italic> merged with sister magazine <italic>Vogue</italic> in 1936, as Editorial Adviser for <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast</italic> <italic>Publications</italic> until his death in 1947. \nMeanwhile, British coal and steel magnate William Berry acquired <italic>Amalgamated Press</italic> magazine empire, including <italic>Financial Times</italic> and over 70 magazines, an encyclopedia, and printing works. (In 1945, <italic>Cazenove</italic>\u2019s Luke Meinertzhagen helped merge <italic>Financial Times</italic> and <italic>Financial News</italic>. He was also connected to other newspapers. Since his second great-grandfather, Richard Potter, co-founded <italic>Manchester Guardian</italic> in the 1820s, the Taylor and Scott families\u2014also linen and clergy heirs\u2014led the newspaper until 1932. To avoid death taxes, the Taylors established a trust to ensure <italic>Guardian</italic>\u2019s funding in perpetuity from 1936.) While Cond\u00e9 Nast had been married Leslie Foster, whose father owned Texan oil and gas interests, they divorced in 1932 and she married Grenfell-cousin Robert Benson. \nBy then, Leo Erlanger, the Catholic godson of Pope Leo XIII, married Mary Prue, a <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast</italic> former junior editor and <italic>Vogue</italic> model.As <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast</italic> faced financial challenges from 1932, the Huguenot Cond\u00e9 Nast<italic> </italic>recruited Leo Erlanger to negotiate with William Berry. Throughout 1933, negotiations took place with Floyd Oldum\u2019s <italic>Atlas</italic> and other <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast</italic> investors. \nAfter Gerald Schiff Warburg married Nast\u2019s daughter in 1933, Berry married a Rothschild heiress in early 1934, and the deal was successfully concluded, allowing Nast to regain control. By 1939, Mary Prue Erlanger\u2019s sister married Gerald Schiff Warburg\u2019s brother Edward. Frank Crowninshield\u2019s nephew, Benjamin Bradlee served as Paris correspondent for <italic>Newsweek Magazine</italic> and married Boston Brahmin Jean Saltonstall in 1942. And in 1949, the daughter of Cond\u00e9 Nast and Leslie Foster married Charles Grenfell, Robert Benson\u2019s cousin and son of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>\u2019s senior director.\nWhile \u2018Jewish banks\u2019 survived in Britain and America, outsiders and Christians replaced cousins and in-laws on as board members and employees. Since Hugh Knowlton married Christine Stanley in 1917, he became VP of <italic>International Acceptance </italic>in 1926 and later VP of <italic>International Manhattan</italic>. Over this period, Christine\u2019s brother Harold grew from President of <italic>Guaranty Trust </italic>to a <italic>Morgan </italic>partner in 1927. After <italic>Kuhn</italic> elected Christian Hugh Knowlton partner by 1933, FA1933 forced Harold Stanley and Harry Morgan to split off from <italic>Morgan </italic>and form <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. \n<italic>Smith</italic> benefited from FA1933 as most of <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>\u2019s securities staff joined <italic>Smith</italic> in 1934, particularly in Chicago, Pittsburgh, and London. Following the expansion, <italic>Smith</italic> faced a cash shortage during the <italic>Panic of 1937</italic>, leading her to merge with <italic>Barney</italic> to form <italic>Smith Barney</italic>. While former <italic>Cravath</italic> lawyer, <italic>Morgan </italic>partner Seymour Gilbert\u2019s brother wed the granddaughter of Boston Brahmin Adams, Seymour died in 1938, and his widow married <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Harold Stanley, kinterlinking <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Merrill</italic> named Harold Stanley\u2019s brother Gilbert to partner and Gertrude Buttenwieser Prins, the sister of Lehman in-law and <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Benjamin, to limited partner in 1944, Harold Stanley\u2019s brother-in-law, Hugh Knowlton remained a <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner, whose daughter married the first cousin once removed of John Morgan\u2019s son-in-law Herbert Satterlee in 1949, her brother Hugh Stanley Knowlton joined <italic>Smith Barney </italic>in 1951, having graduated from <italic>Yale</italic>, served in the Army during WWII, and lawyered after <italic>Harvard</italic> Law.\nLikewise, Chicago\u2019s <italic>Dominick</italic>\u2014which started as <italic>Dominick Dickerman</italic> in 1869\u2014became an investment bank after FA1933 and bought the securities assets of <italic>Iselin</italic>, which became a bank. After graduating from <italic>Harvard</italic>,<italic> </italic><italic>Dominick</italic> heir Watson Dickerman joined <italic>Morgan </italic>NB in 1941, where he served as Assistant Treasurer when he died in 1955. On the other hand, John Adams Morgan\u2014great-grandson of John Morgan and son of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> co-founder Henry Morgan\u2014started at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> before joining <italic>Dominick</italic> in 1957.\nLike with banks, the only notable Jewish newspaper chains in American were under the control of Ochs Sulzberger (<italic>New York Times</italic> and <italic>Chattanooga Times</italic>), Julius Stern (<italic>New York Post</italic>, <italic>Philadelphia Record</italic>, and <italic>Camden Courier and Post</italic>), Paul Block (<italic>Newark Star-Eagle</italic>, <italic>Toledo Blade</italic>, <italic>Duluth Herald</italic> and <italic>News-Tribune</italic>), and Emanuel Adler (<italic>Davenport Times</italic> and other Midwestern papers). Their combined daily circulation (1.4 million) trailed the Christian <italic>Hearst</italic>, <italic>Patterson-McCormick</italic>, and <italic>Scripps-Howard</italic>, with 5.5, 2.3, and 1.8 million respectably. While Jewish newspaper shares increased, many banking heirs converted.\nSince the 1920s, American banking Jew heirs converted and married Christians. When Robert Lehman\u2019s niece, Jean Lehman Ickelheimer, wed Mortimer Schiff\u2019s nephew-in-law in 1928, it was at a Presbyterian Church. These couples often faced a higher divorce rates and remarriages. While his cousins married Sachs and Lehman, Jack Straus married a Protestant in 1924 before becoming CEO of <italic>Macys</italic>. \nLike Dorothy Schiff converted to Episcopalism in 1923, her cousin John Schiff married a daughter of <italic>First</italic> NB<italic> of New York</italic>\u2019s George Baker in 1934. After Dorothy Schiff and her husband divorced, he married a Straus in 1946. In 1952, Fern Baker Tailer\u2014a niece of John Schiff\u2019s wife\u2014married David Gimbel, who joined <italic>Lehman</italic> after the army and <italic>Yale</italic> in 1950. But that marriage soon ended in divorce. While<italic> New York Times</italic> publishing heir Arthur Hays Sulzberger married an Episcopalian in 1948, one of the sons of <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Sidney Weinberg married the daughter of <italic>Corning Glass</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic>Amory Houghton in 1951.\nStill, Schiff\u2019s grandchildren continued to lead banking-industrial and media empires with <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>New York Post.</italic> After the death of her parents in 1931<italic>, </italic>Dorothy Schiff bought <italic>New York Post</italic> from Julius Stern by 1939, turning it into a liberal behemoth. As she befriended FDR, she built a house near the Roosevelt family, and took on taking on targets previously immune to critical coverage, including FBI\u2019s J Edgar Hoover, Senator Joseph McCarthy, and Robert Moses. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Guggenheim</italic> continued to build bridges with Christians. Robert Patterson, son of a Scottish minister, married Nellie Medill, the daughter of Joseph Medill, founder of <italic>Chicago Tribune</italic>. While their son, Joseph Medill Patterson, founded <italic>New York Daily News</italic> in 1919, the daughter Cissy became the first female publisher of a major newspaper, <italic>Washington Times-Herald</italic>, by 1930. \nAfter Joseph Medill Patterson\u2019s daughter Alicia married Harry Guggenheim in 1939, the newlyweds founded <italic>Newsday</italic>, the largest Long Island newspaper. Harry Guggenheim took over leadership of <italic>Guggenheim</italic> by 1951. Also in 1939, Harry\u2019s sister married a second cousin twice removed of FDR, cousin-in-law of the Langhornes, and a brother  of the son-in-law of <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris\u2019 Nelson Jay, reinforcing the decades-long copper kinterlink.\nThe Lehman extended network remained more Jewish. After marrying the daughter of Isaiah Hellman, who was the brother-in-law of Mayer Lehman, Sidney Ehrman became Hellman\u2019s lawyer and helped him acquire <italic>Wells Fargo</italic>. Although Sidney\u2019s daughter Esther Hellman Ehrman married Claude Lazard in a Catholic ceremony in 1932, Sidney\u2019s nephew Fred Ehrman joined <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1929 and married Edith Koshland in 1932. By 1934, Edith\u2019s sister, Ruth, married Isaiah Hellman\u2019s grandson Marco. While Fred Ehrman became <italic>Lehman</italic> partner in 1941, his nephew\u2014Marco Hellman\u2019s son Fred\u2014joined, and became the youngest partner in 1960. As Robert Lehman led <italic>Lehman</italic>, his cousin Herbert (and Altschul\u2019s brother-in-law) governed New York after FDR and became senator after WWII.\nSince Judge Irving Lehman was elected Chief Judge of the New York\u2019s Court of Appeals in 1939 until his Governor Lehman resigned in 1942, New York had brothers at the head of its executive and judicial departments for the first time in its history. Since their sister Harriet married Philip Goodhart, her son Arthur Lehman Goodhart moved to Britain, where he shaped law through writings, without practicing. Arthur also cooperated with his brother-in-law, Frank Altschul of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York, on <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic> projects. \nNazism in Germany fueled progress in America. After Court Justice Frankfurther\u2019s 82-year-old legal scholar uncle was imprisoned in Vienna for his \u2018unguarded remarks\u2019 in 1940, Charles Wyzanski became the first Jewish judge to the Federal District Court. Wyzanski started as one of the few Jews at <italic>Ropes Gre</italic><italic>y</italic>, which led Boston Brahmin-cousin law partnerships in New England throughout the. Wyzanski\u2019s maternal grandmother was the daughter of Emmanuel Myers. \nA scion of a British rabbinical dynasty, Myers served at Moses Montefiore\u2019s synagogue for the Rothschilds and their cousins. Along with serving as the Chief Rabbi of Melbourne, Myers held similar positions across in America. While his maternal uncle wed the daughter of Bavarian-born banker William Scholle of San Francisco, Charles Wyzanski\u2019s father, Henry Wyzanski, held real estate directorships at Boston\u2019s <italic>Real Estate Exchange</italic>, <italic>Equitable Trust</italic>, and <italic>Beacon Trust</italic>.\nWyzanski joined <italic>Ropes Grey</italic> after graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> Law in 1930 and clerking under Judges Augustus Hand and Learned Hand. Appointed solicitor for Department of Labor in 1933 under Secretary Frances Perkins, he collaborated closely with mentor Felix Frankfurter on FDR\u2019s major initiatives, including TA1933 and <italic>International Labor Organization</italic>. Returning to <italic>Ropes Grey</italic> in 1935, Wyzanski became the first Jewish judge to the Federal District Court for Massachusetts in 1941 and married Max Warburg\u2019s daughter two years after. He was President of <italic>Harvard</italic> Overseers in the 1950s.\nMax Warburg\u2019s cousin-once-removed, Ruth Melchior, had married Gustav Fleck, who together fled the Netherlands for America in 1940. In 1941, Fleck arrived in New York with Barons Edouard and Robert Rothschild and helped transfer their assets out of occupied Europe. He worked for a Dutch bank tied to the French Rothschilds, then founded <italic>Amsterdam Overseas</italic> with Rothschild backing. By the mid-1950s, Rothschild <italic>London</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris controlled <italic>Amsterdam Overseas </italic>with <italic>Pierson</italic> and <italic>Lambert</italic>. \nSiegmund Warburg was the son of Max Warburg\u2019s cousin Georges Warburg and his wife Lucie Kaulla. By the 1920s, he married Jewish Eva Philipson, whose father managed <italic>Svenska Handelsbank</italic>, the main rival bank of Wallenberg\u2019s <italic>Stockholm Enskilda Bank</italic>, both of which grew after <italic>Kreuger</italic> collapsed<italic>.</italic> \nAfter Siegmund fled Nazi Germany in 1934 and established <italic>Warburg</italic> London, his cousins immigrated from Hamburg and Amsterdam in 1941 and started <italic>Warburg</italic> New York. Following WWII, Siegmund was unimpressed with <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s new leadership and put off by DOJ\u2019s antitrust suit against brokerages, leading <italic>Warburg</italic> to have a more open relationship rather than resuming the pre-war partnership with <italic>Kuhn</italic>. By 1946, Warburg converted his uncle\u2019s metal trader <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt </italic>and sold a controlling stake to <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>.\nBy then, Warburg\u2019s business partner was Henry Gr\u00fcnfeld, an exiled German industrialist who fled to Britain after the aryanization of his family enterprise and arrest by the Gestapo in 1935. Gr\u00fcnfeld\u2019s second cousin twice removed, Oskar Huldschinsky, was an Upper Silesian industrialist who had married Ida Brandeis, a cousin-in-law of the Goldschmidt, Landauer Schey, and Porges families, in 1882. \nSince the <italic>Treaty of Versailles</italic> transferred eastern Upper Silesia to Poland, much of the family assets were there. In 1931, Gr\u00fcnfeld married a Pressburger descendant whose uncle was Oskar Oliven. Oliven, was the son-in-law of Isidor Loewe, founder of Austrian military and chemical company<italic> Union-Elektrisiert-Gesellschaft </italic>(\u201cUEG\u201d), which merged with GGE at the turn of the century. By 1929, BGGE absorbed another of Loewe\u2019s enterprises led by Oliven. \nEric Warburg, the son of Siegmund\u2019s second cousin Max Magnez Warburg, founded <italic>Warburg</italic> New York in 1939. During WWII, he served as a lieutenant colonel in the American Army and interrogated Nazi captives, including the Luftwaffe commander and <italic>Reichswerke</italic> President Hermann G\u00f6ring. After receiving the Legion of Merit, Eric resumed <italic>Warburg</italic> New York. \nIn 1946, Eric married Goldschmidt-in-law and daughter of Alfons Thorsch, a recently deceased Austrian banker\u2014descended from Katz, Behrend Lehmann, and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother and cousin of <italic>Lippma</italic><italic>n</italic><italic>n Rosenthal</italic> partners\u2014who founded a Czech oil refinery and kinterlinked with Czech coal magnate Petschek before fleeing the Nazis. While <italic>Thorsch</italic> litigation continued for decades, Eric Warburg reclaimed control of <italic>Brinckmann Wirtz</italic> of Hamburg in the late 1940s and<italic> </italic>restored her Jewish name,<italic> Warburg</italic>. Likewise, Robert Pferdmenges returned <italic>Pferdmenges</italic> of Cologne to the Oppenheim family by 1947, who renamed the bank. Helping found <italic>Christian Democratic Union</italic> with his friend since the 1920s, Konrad Adenauer, Pferdmenges became a member of Parliament in 1949.  \nIn late 1945, the American military arrested leading German bankers for financing the Nazi regime. Fifteen executives were detained in the American zone from <italic>Deutsche</italic> (Hans Oesterlink, Albert Pietzsch, Richard Freudenberg, Ernest Russel, Max Schmid, Hermann Schmitz), <italic>Dresdner</italic> (Carl Goetz, Wilhelm Kisskalt, Hans Schippel, Hugo Zinsser, Wilhelm Aveny, Friedrich Flick), <italic>Commerzbank</italic> (Joseph Schilling, Karl Hettlage, Heinrich Giesbert, Alex Haffner), <italic>Deutschen Arbeit</italic> (Heinz Reitbauer), and <italic>Reichs-Kredit</italic> (Hermann Jannsen, Hans Walz, Ludger Westrick). Soviet forces arrested<italic> Berliner</italic> directors. Investigators found that the arrested men controlled over 200 industrial firms and maintained accounts for Heinrich Himmler, justifying prosecution as war criminals alongside defendants at Nuremberg.\nAt Nuremberg, the Allies appointed the judges. Liberal MP Norman Birkett and Lord Justice of Appeal Geoffrey Lawrence represented Britain. President Truman appointed former Attorney General Francis Biddle and John Parker from the Fourth Circuit. And as the Soviets chose Stalin\u2019s show trial judge Iona Nikitchenko, the French appointed Huguenot academic Henri Vabres. Kurt Schr\u00f6der was found guilty by a German court for crimes against humanity and was sentenced to a three-month imprisonment and a fine, which was later reduced to an insignificant amount. Franz Papen, on the other hand, was acquitted but was arrested and held in custody by the Allies for a year.\nFrom the defeat of the Nazis in May 1945, <italic>Merck Finck</italic>\u2019s August Finck was interned, losing executive and supervisory positions until the end of WWII. While the British Military Government asked <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Abs to help rebuild the German banking system in 1945, he was arrested as a suspected war criminal and stripped of his directorships under American pressure by 1946. Despite existing evidence for war crimes prosecution, he was released after three months thanks to British intervention and not tried as he had kept his distance from the Nazis and his international experience was essential for rebuilding. \nSplitting Germany into four zones\u2014controlled by America, Britain, France, and the Soviet Unions\u2014the Allies agreed to the <italic>Potsdam Agreement</italic> to dismantle powerful business interests and cartels in Germany in 1945. This involved dividing <italic>Farben</italic> into nine firms\u2014split across the zones\u2014and holding executives accountable for war crimes. While the Soviet Union implemented socialism instead of decartelization, America and Britain enforced antitrust laws. Britain split steel cartel <italic>Vereinigte Stahlwerke</italic> into four firms\u2014and soon into nineteen separate firms across Germany\u2014but opposed the complete liquidation of large and efficient basic industries. While controlling basic industries for eventual socialization, the Allies liquidated war industries, including the coal and motion picture trusts and the three public banks.\nAs the American and British Allies created the Bizone with Frankfurt as headquarters in 1947, they implemented decartelization measures, splitting <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, and <italic>Dresdner</italic> into smaller regional entities. <italic>Deutsche</italic> was divided into 10 regional banks, with <italic>Hessische Bank</italic> representing her operations in Hessen. <italic>Commerzbank</italic> became <italic>Mitteldeutsche Credit</italic>, and <italic>Dresdner</italic> operated as <italic>Rhein-Main-Bank</italic>, all with headquarters in Frankfurt. \n<italic>Renault</italic> in-law Francois Lehideux was arrested for his collaboration with the Vichy regime and support of Nazi Germany. He was released in 1946, and collaboration charges were dropped in 1949. He did not express regret and defended his decisions as justified. Lehideux became President of <italic>Ford</italic> France from 1949 to 1953. His cousin Phillippe became Administrator of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Navale d\u2019Importation et d\u2019Exportation </italic>for two decades from 1948. Since <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Pierre Weill\u2019s son Michel used false identities and converted to Catholicism to avoid Nazi detection when blocked from escaping France during WWII, Michel married Francois\u2019 niece Helene Lehideux in 1956, moving to America, joined <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in 1956, becoming a Partner in 1961. His father, Pierre, converted to Catholicism in 1965.\nDuring the Nazi terror, Swiss banks accepted gold and other assets from Holocaust victims and stolen by Nazi affiliates. After the war, Holocaust survivors and their heirs tried to reclaim assets from Swiss banks, but they made it difficult with state help for over four decades.\nUnlike in administered Germany, unions of French Vichy and Liberators hindered restoration. In January 1941, <italic>Credit Industriel</italic>\u2019s General Director Charles Dangelzer took over <italic>Transatlantique Bank</italic> with approval from Vichy France\u2019s Treasury and German authorities. Raymond Wallier, who had fled to the free zone and then to Switzerland, returned to Paris in 1944 but was denied his former position by <italic>Industriel</italic>. While the law of November 1944 did not reinstate dismissed Jewish directors in private companies, the ordinance of April 1945 addressed spoliation cases but did not ensure reinstatement for private-sector employees. In May 1945, Weill sought arbitration from BDF, which resulted in a report but no intervention. \nDays after French Liberator Emmanuel Monick was appointed Governor of BDF in October 1945, his daughter married Dangelzer\u2019s son G\u00e9rard. After negotiations about the expropriation of <italic>Transatlantique</italic> shares during aryanization, he handed over of <italic>Amsterdamsche Beheers</italic> and monetary compensation to Wallier in December, enabling him to establish <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Franco-Am\u00e9ricaine</italic>. While Wallier never regained a position as significant as his former role at <italic>Transatlantique</italic>, Monick became President of <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1949 and G\u00e9rard later became General Director of <italic>Indochine</italic>. \nResistance bankers also prospered. Since Olivier Moreau-N\u00e9ret resigned from as <italic>Ministry of Finance</italic> Secretary General for Economic Affairs for disputing German claims in 1940, he returned to <italic>Lyonnais</italic> in the Free Zone, and became Managing Director in 1949. <italic>Indochine</italic> Deputy Managing Director Jean Laurent, Gaulle\u2019s former aide, managed operations from Vichy and Marseille, was arrested in November 1944, cleared in December, and became Managing Director until his death in 1952. <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Andr\u00e9 Debray organized clandestine Resistance financing inside the bank, fought in Paris in 1944, and served as director to 1954.\nAfter the war, <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Indochine</italic> were reshaped by government-appointed leaders, with Robert Bordaz overseeing <italic>Paribas</italic> and Emile Minost at <italic>Indochine</italic>. The latter retained her colonial privileges in Indochina while permitting <italic>Nationale</italic> to establish operations in Saigon. Only about thirty French bank executives\u2014with a quarter from <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2014faced consequences after the Liberation. While Paul Thomasson, who became a Director of <italic>Paribas</italic> and administered <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris before aryanization, faced scrutiny after WWII, <italic>Indochine</italic> hired him as Deputy General Manager in 1950. \nAlthough former General Manager of <italic>Indochine </italic>Paul Baudouin benefited from testimony of resistant Pierre Louis-Dreyfu\u00df during his trial in 1947, his assets were confiscated, and he was sentenced to 5 years of labor.  Baudouin was released by 1949, regaining most of his directorships, and hiring his cellmate, former Chief of Police Ren\u00e9 Bousquet as Advisor. Leveraging his network, Bousquet replaced Thomasson as Deputy General Manager of <italic>Indochine</italic> by 1960 and joined the boards of <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Mines</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier de la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie</italic>, and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Plantations R\u00e9unies de l\u2019Ouest Africain</italic>. After funding several presidential elections, Bousquet was indicted as a collaborator the late 1980s. \nWhile <italic>Paribas</italic> replaced her wartime Chair in 1944, his niece married Nicolas Kagan in 1947 as he broke his kinterlink with <italic>Indochine</italic><italic> </italic>and soon headed <italic>Seligman</italic> Paris. Kagan\u2019s possible relative, Lazar Kaganovich, was by then the highest-ranking individual of Jewish heritage in the Soviet Union. From 1944 to 1946, he resumed the deputy chairmanship and took over the Ministry of Construction Materials in 1946.\n<italic>Seligman</italic> Paris soon worked with Vladimir Ponomarev, a second cousin of the Soviet Union\u2019s long-time International Central Committee member Boris Ponomarev, was a BSU and <italic>Narodny </italic>Paris executive before heading <italic>Vneshtorg</italic>. \n<italic>Seligman</italic> Paris also worked with <italic>Narodny </italic>Paris, headed from 1947 by Jacob Hilsum. Hilsum had married Roza Horowitz\u2014a descendant of the Katz Chief Rabbi of Vienna\u2014and a cousin Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn, who had married to a cousin of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s deceased FX specialist Eug\u00e8ne Mehler and worked with <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Andr\u00e9 Meyer to for <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier Industriel</italic> (\u201cSOVAC\u201d) in the 1920s. By 1949, Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn\u2019s son married David Weill\u2019s daughter.\nAnother <italic>Narodny</italic> Paris director, Guy Boysson, was born into an aristocratic family and married Genevi\u00e8ve Chevrillon, whose uncle had married a Porges Schnapper cousin of the Rothschilds at the turn of the century, and rose in the ranks of the French government after WWII. In 1950, he left public office and joined <italic>Narodny</italic> Paris, succeeding Hilsum in 1965.  \nBy then <italic>Rothschild</italic> only had London and Paris out of the five original branches. So, the family invested in growth. In 1946, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London hired David Colville. His father served as Secretary of <italic>Institute of Chartered Accountants</italic> and was the son of Conservative politician First Viscount Colville. His maternal grandfather, a Liberal Cabinet minister, re-married the daughter of Count Primrose and Hannah Rothschild. Upon graduation, David had joined <italic>Lloyd </italic>Bank, and wed the Earl of Jersey\u2019s daughter a year later in 1933. Treasurer of <italic>Lloyd </italic>since 1939, Colville became <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s first non-family partner in 1960. \nBecause <italic>Pearson</italic> sold his Mexican oil operations to <italic>Shell</italic> during WWI when investing in <italic>Lazard</italic> London, the latter had a large stake in <italic>Shell</italic>, while <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris was <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s sole banker in France. In 1945, Weetman Pearson\u2019s granddaughter married extended <italic>Rothschild</italic> cousin Richard Gibson, born to a Christian  father and an ennobled mother descended from Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister and Joseph Goldschmidt. Having served in the Italian section of <italic>Special Operations Executive</italic> during WWII, Gibson joined <italic>Pearson</italic> in 1946.\nFrom 1946, Britain nationalized BOE, construction, telecoms, and aviation. As coal shortages grew, she nationalized coal, PUs, gas, steel, and transport. Although BOE began discounting leasing bills in 1930, she limited them since 1936. After WWII, the British empire had a surplus of wool that it wanted to export to earn FX. As large French textiles sought to import British wool around 1947, they hired <italic>Lazard</italic> London over <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> to syndicate a revolving loan. Similar syndicated wool loans were arranged by <italic>Lohmann</italic> for Scandinavia (out of Amsterdam by Bremen importers associated with <italic>Lloyd</italic>), <italic>Kleinwort</italic> for Poland, <italic>Warburg</italic> London for Czechoslovakia, and <italic>Barclay</italic> for Italy.\nFrance also nationalized BDF, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9</italic> <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, most insurers, coal mines, <italic>Renault</italic>, and the production, transport, and distribution of electricity in 1946. <italic>Wendel</italic> was stripped of her vast coal lands, but the steel industry narrowly escaped confiscation. Per a new law, banks had to register either as deposit or investment securities firms. While most of the Huguenot banks chose to be deposit banks, <italic>Mirabaud</italic> and the Jewish <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris<italic>, </italic>and<italic> Worms </italic>registered as investment banks. \nBack in the 1920s, Jacques Ganay\u2014an aristocratic Haber descendant and a nephew of a Schneider\u2014married fellow aristocrat H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Durfort. Durfort\u2019s sister then wed Charles-Albert Boissieu, who became Inspector General of <italic>Transatlantique </italic>in 1929, and Deputy Director of <italic>Schneider</italic>\u2019s <italic>Union Europ\u00e9enne Industrielle </italic>from 1930. And in 1929, Christian mining engineer Jules Aubrun left <italic>Schneider</italic>\u2019s <italic>Creusot</italic> for <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, representing her in steel enterprises, including <italic>Batignolles</italic>. In 1945, he joined the board of <italic>Paribas</italic>.\nAfter Ganay\u2019s brother Eudes married Magdeleine\u2014a great granddaughter of rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> founder Ernest Go\u00fcin and Pereire and Fould cousin Anna Rodrigues\u2014her siblings wed Gaston Gunzburg Fould Gradis\u2019 brother and David Weil\u2019s cousin once removed. Ernest Go\u00fcin\u2019s second cousin Eug\u00e8ne had co-founded <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1870 and served as Chair at turn of the century. \nAs Charles-Albert Boissieu became Director of <italic>Schneider</italic><italic> </italic>in 1937, his third cousin, Michel, married a descendant of Isaac Orchel in 1940. Following WWII, Michel\u2019s fourth cousin once removed Jean married a daughter of General Charles Gaulle in 1946. The same year, Ganay\u2019s nephew wed an aristocratic Christian niece of a Bischoffsheim and Thellusson descendants connected to the Wendels. \nWhile <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Petrofina</italic> director Eduard Cahen-Fuzier\u2014whose father\u2019s first wife, Rodrigues, was a cousin-in-law of the Cerf, Aron, Alphand\u00e9ry, and Lazard family, and a second cousin once removed of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>\u2019s Jacob Pereire\u2014died in 1948, one daughter married a Rodrigues Eichthal cousin of the Go\u00fcins in 1944 and another daughter wed Jean Paisy. \nDescended from a pre-Revolutionary French stockbroker, Paisy was part of <italic>Paris Stock Exchange</italic>, serving as an assistant to the regulatory <italic>Syndicat des Bourses de Paris</italic> in 1946 and Deputy from 1954. Paisy\u2019s sons-in-law, Pierre Baudouin and Pierre DuPont, also held important roles in French finance. Baudouin, like his father-in-law, was involved in stockbroking and served in roles on <italic>Paris Stock Exchange</italic>. DuPont began his career at the Ministry of Finance in 1932, became Deputy Director in 1943, and served as Head of Service at the Ministry of Economic Affairs from 1949.\nLikewise, Henri Polo, a stockbroker at <italic>Nantes Stock Exchange</italic> since the 1930s, was born into a Nantes family that owned shipyards, ships, and sugar refineries. In 1952, he pivoted to being President of the fish cannery <italic>Saupiquet</italic> and was also connected by family ties to the Fouchiers. The son of President of the Court of Auditors, a cousin once removed of former Dublin bankers <italic>Touche</italic>, Jacques Fouchier began his career as a civil servant, serving as Inspector of Finance in 1934. \nDespite rising to <italic>Ministry of Finance</italic> Chief of Staff, he resigned after Laval\u2019s speech favoring German victory and joined the Free French army in 1942. In 1946, he tapped the capital markets to found consumer and mortgage finance companies with equity from <italic>Parisienne</italic>, which he consolidated under <italic>Co Bancaire</italic> in 1959, which became <italic>Parisienne</italic>\u2019s largest borrower.\nUpon the nationalization of mines in 1946, a descendant of <italic>Paribas</italic> co-founder Eug\u00e8ne Go\u00fcin married a son of Jos\u00e9 Massenet Ari\u00e9s, President of <italic>Banque de l\u2019Union des Mines</italic>, which collieries had launched in 1923. While his family Carmaux mines were nationalized, Marquis Guy Solages retained residual holdings and invested them in new ventures. \nFrom an aristocratic Catholic family, Solages\u2019 brother Alain had married Gaston Go\u00fcin\u2019s daughter and administered their rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles </italic>by the 1930s. Alain also belonged to the board of <italic>Schneider</italic> and <italic>Banque de l\u2019Union des Mines</italic>. In 1949, Guy merged his family holdings with a regional bank to form <italic>Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Industrielle</italic>, which then fused with <italic>Co Financi\u00e8re, Industrielle La H\u00e9nin</italic> in 1952. <italic>l\u2019Union des Mines</italic>\u2019 Ari\u00e9s, however, refused to join.\nThe <italic>Lazard</italic>-cousin-in-law Goldschmidt-Goldets restored their <italic>Jupiter</italic> oil refinery<italic> </italic>with <italic>Shell</italic>. Before WWI, Henri Goldschmidt married an oil refining Halphen Deutsch-Meurthe heiress, and their children adopted the \u201cGoldet\u201d surname. Nelly Goldet married Huguenot bank <italic>Vernes</italic> heir F\u00e9lix Mallet Vernes in 1923, brother Andr\u00e9 married Andr\u00e9 Lazard\u2019s Goldschmidt niece-in-law in 1924, and brother Roger revived the bankrupt <italic>Pinaud</italic> perfumery in 1935 and married a Huguenot bank <italic>Andr\u00e9</italic> heiress in 1942. After WWII, Andr\u00e9 Goldet became VP of <italic>Electrochemistry, Electrometallurgy, & Electric Steelworks Co of Ugine</italic> (\u201c<italic>Ugine</italic>\u201d).\nAs the French government explored for oil in North Africa in 1947, nationalized <italic>Nationale</italic> sold her London branches to <italic>Warburg</italic> and <italic>Benson</italic> in a stock swap to focus on Africa. So, as <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris regained her French mines following WWII, she began modernizing and shifting to Africa. Created in 1919, Maurice Schlumberger\u2019s <italic>Schlumberger</italic> bank merged with cousins to <italic>Neuflize</italic> create <italic>Neuflize</italic> <italic>Schlumberger</italic> in 1945.\n<italic> </italic>Since <italic>Electrique</italic> PUHC\u2019s Jean Boissonnas married Genevi\u00e8ve Mirabaud in 1919 and became a Partner of <italic>Mirabaud</italic>, one son inherited his father\u2019s directorships while another wed his extended Schlumberger cousin in 1935 and worked at their bank. The Schlumbergers also partnered with Jewish and Catholic banking heirs. \nFleeing Europe from the Nazis for America, Andr\u00e9 Istel, who was Samson Wertheim\u2019s 6th great-grandson and Germaine Halphen Rothschild\u2019s fourth cousin once removed. He advised the French government during WWII. After the war, his nephew married a second cousin once removed of <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s David Weill, and Andr\u00e9 participated at <italic>Bretton Woods</italic> and opened securities firm<italic> Istel</italic> in New York with Jean Riboud\u2014whom the Nazis had held captive at Buchenwald despite his Catholic father being a <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Lyonnaise de D\u00e9p\u00f4ts</italic> banker and a friend of the Schlumbergers\u2014to represent mostly the latter family.  \nIn Britain, with the state and non-Jewish banker families already inter-married, policy alternated between free markets and central planning. During WWII, BOE failed to merge <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Baring</italic>, and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>. After the war, Britain briefly made the <italic>pound</italic> convertible. Moreover, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand convinced Parliament to establish public agencies\u2014<italic>Industrial & Commercial Finance Corp</italic>\u2014to invest in industry and small business that he had advocated for since the 1920s. As the industries\u2014before merging in the 1970s and eventually privatizing as <italic>3i</italic>\u2014they worked closely with <italic>Warburg </italic>London. \nIn America, bankers financed innovation. In 1937, James Loeb Warburg became involved with Edwin Land, who developed a synthetic process for creating polaroid material. Organizing Averell Harriman, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> <italic>Rockefeller</italic>, and <italic>Kuhn</italic>, Warburg financed Land\u2019s <italic>Polaroid</italic>. To avoid taxes and fund entrepreneurship, American venture capital funds (\u201cVC\u201d) started after WWII. \nLike with funding aviation in the 1930s, Nelson Rockefeller\u2019s son, Laurance, founded <italic>Rockefeller </italic>family VC in 1946, the first firm to pool VC capital professionally. The same year, MIT\u2019s treasurer, a <italic>Harvard</italic> Professor of Industrial Management, and other several Boston Brahmin co-founded <italic>American Research & Development Cor</italic>p (\u201cARD\u201d) in Boston with investment from the Coolidge family and support from the FRS <italic>Boston</italic> President. \nIn 1947, Congress reorganized OSS into <italic>Central Intelligence Agency</italic> (\u201cCIA\u201d). Since serving in OSS during WWII, the American and Russian aristocrat bankers reinforced ties as America and the Soviet Union started the Cold War. Leaving <italic>Armour</italic> to join <italic>Harris</italic> SB in Chicago in 1935, Lester Armour served as OSS\u2019 last commander in London, married Alexandra Galitzine in 1949, and returned as Vice Chair of <italic>Harris</italic> until 1965. \nGalitzine\u2019s former Romanov husband was related a cousin in law of Count Vadim Golubev, who wed a cousin of Winston Churchill\u2019s wartime general Otto Lund in 1961. Lund\u2019s son Anthony joined <italic>Kuhn</italic> and, in 1967, married Golubev\u2019s cousin once removed Sofia Soumarokoff Elston. Her third cousin twice removed, Prince Serge Obolensky, was wed to Ava Astor in the 1920s and served in OSS.\nValerian Lada-Mocarski, the son of a Russian general, was one of the few members of the Tsar\u2019s guard to survive the 1917 Revolution. After fleeing Russia, he joined his uncle, the Ukrainian ambassador, in France as a secretary. In Paris, he met an heiress of <italic>Klots Throwing Co</italic> of Pennsylvania. They married in 1924 and moved to America. Working in banking, he was a director at <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> New York by 1930. \nAfter Allen Dulles became a <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> director in 1937, Lada-Mocarski\u2019s brother wed Olivia Loomis\u2014whose father was a former President of <italic>Lehigh Valley</italic> RR and sister was married to a Schieffelin, a cousin of the Vanderbilt, Morgan, and Roosevelt families\u2014in 1940. Resigning from banking to serve OSS on intelligence operations in Europe in 1941, he returned to <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, rising to SVP in 1951 and Vice Chair in 1964.\nBack in 1940, Prince Obolensky\u2019s second cousin once removed married North Carolina manufacturer David Morg\u2014an extended cousin-in-law of the Morgans\u2014whose daughter married a Smyth descendant, who had worked at <italic>Morgan</italic> in New York from 1930, and then joining New York bank <italic>Spencer Trask</italic> in London. \nLikewise, a niece of John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife married Georgian Prince Simon Sidamon, whose family had known that of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in the 1920s. After Daniel Peabody Davison\u2014a son and grandson of <italic>Morgan</italic> partners\u2014graduated from <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law in 1952, he worked at <italic>White Case</italic> and married Katusha Cheremeteff, a second cousin twice removed of Prince Obolensky and a third-great-niece-in-law of Tsar Nicholas II. In 1955, he joined <italic>Morgan</italic>, becoming secretary in 1957.\nThe Morgan-CIA bonds continued. Having graduated from <italic>Havard</italic> and served in Korea, Richard Tucker, born to clothiers descended from Huguenots and Quakers, worked at <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris and <italic>Morgan</italic> New York before joining CIA\u2019s <italic>Office of</italic> <italic>Psychological Warfare</italic> and then <italic>International Cooperation Administration</italic>. By 1955, he married a descendant of Charles Tiffany. Since Tiffany founded the future jeweler <italic>Tiffany </italic>in 1837, he partnered with silversmith John Moore, whose son married the daughter of <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris\u2019 Senior Partner John Harjes in 1886. \nAlthough America\u2019s anti-aristocratic Constitution fostered a financier-led one-directional oligarchy, there were few lines between British banks, industry, media, aristocracy, and other policy makers. Since Elizabeth Lyon Bowes\u2014Abel Smyth\u2019s third great granddaughter, third great niece of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, and third cousin-in-law of John Morgan\u2019s Burns nephew\u2014married the younger brother of King Edward VIII, the resignation of the latter in 1936 led to the crowning of King George VI. After King George died in 1952, his daughter, a Smyth descendant, became Queen Elizabeth II. \nUnlike before WWI, inter-married Anglican, Scott, Quaker, and converted Jew cousins dominated Britain\u2019s government and merchant banks, including the Hambro, Benson, Smyth, and Jardine-Keswick families. As his cousins led Britain\u2019s Conservative party, <italic>Foreign Office</italic>, <italic>Exchequer</italic>, merchant banks (<italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Yule Catto</italic>, <italic>Jardine</italic>, <italic>Lloyd</italic>), industry (AEI), media (<italic>Tribune</italic>), and Cameron Cobbold became BOE Governor in 1949.\nSince Everard Hambro, grandson of Denmark\u2019s Court Jew, married a Stuart descendant, he served as a BOE Director since 1877, and his son Charles earned a KBE appointment and served in the Coldstream Guards. After another son married a Smyth cousin in 1917, Charles wed MP John Cobbold\u2019s granddaughter Pamela by 1919. From a Suffolk family, John Cobbold established a prominent brewery and involved in family in Ipswich, where he was MP from 1847 to 1868. Since Pamela\u2019s brother married the Duke of Devonshire\u2019s daughter, their daughter wed Lieutenant Colonel HE Hambro\u2019s step-grandson. While John\u2019s brother Ernest married Helen Cazenove, his brother Nathaniel was the grandfather of Cameron Cobbold. \nAfter BOE Governor Montague Norman\u2019s cousin daughter married George Abell\u2014a BOE Director, <italic>Lloyd</italic> Bank Director\u2019s son in 1928, and the Governor of Sarawak\u2019s nephew\u2014whose brother-in-law married a Hambro, Norman became Governor of BOE and married a cousin-in-law of Stuart and Hambro by 1933. Norman\u2019s successor at BOE was Thomas Catto, followed by Cameron Cobbold. Cobbold had attended <italic>Cambridge</italic> before joining <italic>Italian Excess Insurance Co</italic> in the late 1920s. Cobbold\u2019s involvement in the rescue of <italic>Banco Italo-Britannica</italic> in 1929 brought him to BOE\u2019s attention. Joining Norman\u2019s BOE in 1933, he rose swiftly, becoming Executive Director in 1938 and Deputy Governor in 1945.  \nThat year, Cobbold\u2019s second cousin Ralph married Mary Wyndham, a Christian aristocratic niece of Hannah Rothschild Primrose and a descendant of Abel Smyth. Wyndham\u2019s fourth cousin was Robin Leigh-Pemberton, a descendant of King Charles II, <italic>Touche</italic> of Dublin, and the founding family of aristocratic Scottish bank <italic>Drummond</italic>, which <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic> (\u201cRBS\u201d) had taken over<italic> </italic>in the 1920s. In 1953, Leigh-Pemberton married a sister of Anthony Forbes, of unknown relation to other Forbes families, but a cousin of the Campbell and Lubbock families. In 1960, Forbes joined <italic>Cazenove</italic>, where several relatives also worked. Also in 1960, Cobbold\u2019s son-in-law joined <italic>Hambro</italic>.\nLikewise, Humphrey Mynors, a nephew of former BOE Deputy Governor Ernest Harvey\u2014an in-law of the Pagets and a cousin-in-law of Brand, Lascelles\u2014and Spencer cousin-in-law, began his career at BOE in the 1930s, advancing to the role of Secretary in 1934, Principal of the Secretary\u2019s Department, Deputy Secretary by 1938, Staff Director in 1949, and Deputy Governor in 1954, following Dallas Bernard, and held this position until 1964. Since <italic>British Overseas Bank</italic> absorbed <italic>Huth</italic> in 1936, the former merged into <italic>Glyn Mills</italic> in 1944, and a <italic>Glyn</italic> Partner was appointed to the Court of BOE in 1949, the first clearing banker to do so. \nWhile <italic>Lazard</italic> London linked BOE to <italic>Lloyd</italic> Bank with partners Kindersley on BOE\u2019s Court and Brand on <italic>Lloyds</italic> Bank\u2019s board since WWI, BOE\u2019s Court generally consisted of merchant bankers, not commercial banks, for centuries. After WWII, <italic>Huth</italic> heir brothers Daniel and Lucas Meinertzhagen returned to <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Cazenove</italic>. While Meinertzhagen\u2019s cousins wed a Smyth cousin 1945, another married the newly divorced Victor Wertheim Rothschild in 1946. \nWhile Meinertzhagen\u2019s cousin Lawrence Potter Holt retired as Chair of <italic>Elder Dempster </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>, <italic>Royal Mail </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>, and related lines in 1953, his cousin John Potter Hobhouse became Chair and soon expanded the company. Since the Holts co-founded <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> acquired London bank <italic>Martin </italic>in 1918, and chaired the combined bank from 1923, Robert Martin married Samson Lloyd\u2019s great-granddaughter Cecilly Barclay in 1951, and became Vice Chair of <italic>Bank of London & South America</italic>. \nSince serving as Counsellor at the British Embassy in DC, British<italic> </italic>Civil Service aristocrat Adam Marris returned to <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1947 as Managing Director overseeing the firm\u2019s strategic direction. By 1953, Marris joined <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s board, where his children and in-laws held executive roles into the 21st century. Marrying Weetman Pearson\u2019s cousin in 1932, William Acton was a Director at <italic>Lazard</italic> London from 1926 to 1953. \nAs Acton joined the board of <italic>Bank of British West Africa </italic>in 1954, his other seven directorships included <italic>Standard Bank of South Africa</italic>, <italic>Bank of London & South America</italic>, and <italic>Bank of London & Montreal</italic>. During WWII, he served in <italic>Exchequer</italic>\u2019s Exchange Control operations. Within a year, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Barclay</italic>, and <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> formed South Africa\u2019s first merchant bank, <italic>Union Acceptances</italic>, which dominated the money market for two decades. By 1957, John Ashton\u2014whose father descended from cotton brokers and earned a barony and mother was Brand\u2019s cousin once removed\u2014joined <italic>Barclay</italic>.\nWhile <italic>Lazard</italic> London-owner Viscount Cowdray<italic> </italic>Weetman Pearson\u2019s grandson Weetman Churchill Pearson, the third Viscount, married a cousin-in-law of Hannah Rothschild Primrose in 1939, his cousin married the Christian extended <italic>Rothschild</italic> cousin Richard Gibson in 1945, who later became Chair of<italic> Finance Times</italic>. As the third Viscount chaired <italic>Pearson </italic>(and divorced from his wife in 1950), his twin sister Angela, married a third cousin of Robin Leigh-Pemberton, became a director of <italic>Westminster Press</italic>, <italic>Pearson</italic>\u2019s local newspaper subsidiary, in 1945, and served as Chair starting in 1953.\nWhile Robert Brand stepped down as Managing Director of <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1944, he remained a director, and his nephew, Thomas Brand, succeeded him as Managing Director and Chair. As <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Kindersley became a baron in 1941, his son, also served as BOE\u2019s part-time director until Britain nationalized her. By 1960, the third Lord Kindersley joined<italic> Lazard</italic> London, his directorates included <italic>London Assurance</italic> and soon, <italic>Kreuger</italic>\u2019s <italic>Match</italic>. Since a Rothschild heiress married newspaper magnate William Berry in 1934, the Berry heirs sold off <italic>Financial Times</italic> and other papers to <italic>Pearson</italic> in 1957. \nAfter <italic>Cazenove</italic>\u2019s Luke Meinertzhagen helped merge <italic>Financial Times</italic> and <italic>Financial News </italic>in 1945, his brother Daniel became Managing Director of <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1954 and Partner in 1955. By 1957 Daniel organized the sale of <italic>Financial Times</italic> to <italic>Pearson</italic>. From 1965, Oliver Poole, Chair of the Conservative party, became Head of <italic>Lazard</italic> London. As <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s main shareholder, Pearson diversified <italic>Pearson</italic>,<italic> </italic>Poole managed <italic>Pearson</italic>, <italic>Westminster Press</italic>, and other businesses. \nAt the turn of the century, Pearson\u2019s cousin Winston Spencer-Churchill had married into Scottish aristocrat Ogilvy family, closely connected to the Queen. While Clementine Ogilvy helped Winston become PM through WWII, her nephew David Ogilvy established <italic>Ogilvy Benson Mather</italic>, an advertising agency in New York in 1948, where he revolutionized American advertising. \nTheir cousin, David Ogilvy, son of the Earl of Airlie, married the granddaughter of Episcopalian-convert <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Otto Kahn and banker Thomas Ryan in 1952, he joined <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> in 1953, and became Chair by 1973. He also directed <italic>Barclay</italic>, <italic>British Linen Bank</italic>, <italic>Camperdown Trust</italic>, and several <italic>Scottish American Trusts</italic>. David\u2019s brother, Angus married Princess Alexandra in 1963. In 1959, David\u2019s other brother James joined stockbroker <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic> from <italic>Panmure Gordon</italic>. \nWhile South African Julian Thompson resigned after marrying a daughter of <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Thomas Brand and left for <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> in 1956, William Robson, son-in-law of a <italic>Jardine</italic><italic> </italic>partner, joined the following year. Since <italic>Knoop</italic> heiress Eliza Knoop married a <italic>Hambro</italic> heir in 1930, she divorced him in 1946. By then her brother Wilfred became a partner <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic>. After his niece married Fergus Lyon-Bowes\u2014a Smyth descendant and cousin of Queen Elizabeth II\u2014in 1956, Wilfred joined <italic>Lazard</italic> London.\nAs Esmond Baring grew <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic>, his brother-in-law William Burns Harcourt led <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> from 1931 to 1968. After training at <italic>Baring</italic>, Bill Mackworth-Young\u2014a descendant of Francis Baring\u2019s brother and first cousin once removed of Edward Young, Chair of <italic>Imperial Bank of Persia</italic>, which was renamed to <italic>British Bank of the Middle East</italic> in 1949\u2014joined <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic> in 1953. \nSince his uncle led India in the 1870s and father governed Egypt for over two decades until 1907, Evelyn Baring became Governor of Southern Rhodesia from 1942 until his appointment as Governor of South Africa, Bechuanaland, Basutoland, and Swaziland in 1944. He subsequently held the position of Governor of Kenya from 1952 onwards. Prior to his career in governance, Baring had gained experience in the Indian Civil Service and had married the daughter of the 5th Earl Grey. Baring played a pivotal role in securing the supply of South African uranium for Britain\u2019s nuclear weaponry. John Loder joined <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1950. While his paternal grandmother was a descendant of the 2nd Earl Grey and her cousin an ancestor of Robert Brand, his paternal grandfather descended from an private bank purchased by <italic>National Westminster Bank</italic>. In 1961, Loder left to join <italic>British South Africa Co</italic> and <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>.\nHaving worked at <italic>Mackinnon Mackenzie</italic> in Calcutta, heir Angus Mackinnon joined <italic>Brown Shipley</italic> in 1946, serving as Chair from 1953 through 1963. Earlier, James Mackay, a son of an Arbroath shipmaster, left Scotland and was a Partner at <italic>Mackinnon Mackenzie</italic> Calcutta by 1874, where he saved the Bombay office from bankruptcy. He served as President of <italic>Bengal Chamber of Commerce</italic> from 1890 to 1893 and a Director of <italic>Chartered Bank of India, Australia, & Chin</italic>a from 1893 to 1897. \nKnighted for his role in India\u2019s currency reforms, Mackay returned to Britain in 1894, joining <italic>British India Steam Shipping</italic> and becoming Chair in 1913. Offered the viceroyalty of India in 1909, he opted for a peerage in 1911, becoming Baron Inchcape. He joined <italic>British India Shipping</italic>, becoming Chair in 1913 and merging it with <italic>Peninsular & Oriental Shipping </italic>(\u201cP&O\u201d) in 1914. During WWI, his son kinterlinked with the White Rajah Brooke dynasty of Sarawakl which the British government annexed to Borneo, with the pacification of Japan in the Pacific and end of military rule in 1946.\nIn 1933, James Macakay\u2019s son-in-law, then-Chair of P&O Alex Shaw, e traveled to India and Australia with Donald Anderson, who had started with his family\u2019s shipping firm <italic>Anderson </italic>in 1928, and joined P&O in 1934. During WWII, Anderson served in the Ministry of Shipping and the Ministry of War Transport and was part of the British Merchant Shipping Mission in Washington, DC. In 1943, he joined P&O board and became Managing Director in 1946, Deputy Chair in 1950, and Chair from 1960. As Deputy Chair, Anderson led the entry of P&O into the tanker market in 1955, formed <italic>Trident Tankers</italic> in 1962, and merged two companies running shelter deck tramp ships into <italic>Hain-Nourse</italic> in 1965 responsible for the bulk carriers.\nWhile Donald\u2019s cousin Auckland Anderson Geddes was Chair of <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> from 1925 until his death in 1954 despite vision loss. Auckland\u2019s brother Eric resigned from the House of Commons, becoming Chair of <italic>Dunlop Rubber</italic> and <italic>Imperial Airways</italic> by 1924. Despite changing leadership, Eric\u2019s youngest brother, Irvine, was for many years Chair of <italic>Orient Steam Navigation Co</italic> and a director of <italic>Imperial Airways</italic> and, after merging with British<italic> Airways</italic> in 1939, <italic>British Overseas Airways Corp</italic>. While sister Mona was the first woman to be awarded an MD by <italic>Edinburgh Uni</italic>, sister Margaret served as Edinburgh\u2019s senior magistrate. Eric\u2019s son Reay Geddes, worked at BOE, married a granddaughter of gold refiner <italic>Johnson</italic>\u2019s first Chair Matthey in 1938, and joined <italic>Dunlop</italic>, where his father had previously been Chair.\nWhile his brother managed <italic>Samuel Montagu</italic> by 1959, <italic>Special Operations Executive</italic> alum and <italic>Jardine</italic> Chair William Keswick served as Chair of <italic>Hudson\u2019s Bay</italic> and directed <italic>Alliance Assurance</italic>, <italic>British Petroleum</italic><italic> </italic>(former <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic>), and BOE, alongside his cousin Vivian Smyth. Along with <italic>Shell</italic>, Vickers, and AEI, Smyths directed several merchant banks. As Vivian Smyth oversaw <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> and <italic>Yule Catto</italic>, Reginald Smyth directed <italic>Arbuthnot Latham</italic>, along with his nephew Nigel Robson and cousin-in-law. While Reginald became Chair of the bank in 1960, Robson succeeded him after his death and served as Vice Chair of <italic>National </italic><italic>Provincial</italic>. Smyths also directed <italic>Coutts</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>, <italic>Commercial Bank of the Near East</italic>, and <italic>Zoete</italic><italic>. </italic>\nIn the early 1960s, cousins with the \u2018Smyth\u2019 surname held 17 City appointments, overseeing 87 directorships across 75 companies, including AEI and <italic>Royal Assurance</italic>. Since the 1920s, lay Owen Smyth also owned the church-oriented <italic>Guardian</italic> newspaper before shuttering it in 1951 due to declining readership and increasing taxes.<italic> </italic>Other Smyth descendants lacked the surname. David Bowes-Lyon\u2014Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s uncle\u2014served as a director of <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> <italic>Martin </italic>from 1937 until his death in 1961.\nSmyth cousins also married other financiers. Nicholas Goodison\u2014a son and grandson of London stockbrokers of <italic>Goodison</italic>\u2014joined <italic>Goodison</italic> in 1958 and married a Smyth descendant in 1960. He became partner in 1962 and joined <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>\u2019s Council in 1968. Another extended Smyth cousin-in-law, James Muir, inherited the chairmanship of tea merchant bank <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic><italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>\nOther Americans also had more luck in Britain. While multiple New York neighborhoods preserved the Astor legacy, the actual American branch of the family declined in prominence while the British branch gained influence in politics and publishing. In the 1950s, Lord Astor Baron of Hever, an in-law of <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Reginald Grenfell, served as Chair of <italic>Times Publishing</italic>, and his wife left Parliament in 1945 after becoming the first female member in 1919.\nBut <italic>Lazard</italic> offices followed their host countries. In America, since President Wilson appointed <italic>Lazard</italic> scion Eugene Meyer to lead WFC in 1917, his successors appointed Eugene as the first Jew to lead FFLB (1927), FRS (1930), RFC (1932), and <italic>Bretton Woods</italic>\u2019 <italic>World Bank</italic> (\u201c<italic>BANK</italic>\u201d), mainly <italic>International</italic> <italic>Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> (\u201cIBRD\u201d) (shortly in 1946 before fleeing the bureaucracy.) \nWhile he bought the <italic>Washington Post</italic> newspaper out of bankruptcy, he never returned to <italic>Lazard.</italic> While Meyer was one of <italic>Harriman</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> biggest clients, Averell Harriman was a director of <italic>Newsweek Magazine.</italic><italic> </italic>Like Meyer, his daughter Katherine, married a Christian, who became the head of the <italic>Washington Post</italic> until his death in 1963, when Katherine took over and became the first female CEO of a <italic>Fortune 500</italic> company<italic>.</italic> \nEugene Meyer\u2019s cousin from San Francisco, Frank Altschul, led <italic>Lazard</italic> New York since 1916, co-founded the <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic> in 1920, and backed Republicans against FDR until Hitler alarmed him in 1940 to switch support. After <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Andr\u00e9 Meyer and the Weills fled Nazi France, Pierre Weill invited Meyer to<italic> Lazard</italic> New York. As Meyer rallied for dealmaking over <italic>General American Investors</italic>, a low-margin IHC with <italic>Lehman</italic>, Altschul withdrew with <italic>General American Investors</italic> to the <italic>Council</italic>, allowing Meyer to take over and refocus on dealmaking from 1943. \nAltschul\u2019s son with Helen Lehman Goodhart, Arthur, graduated from <italic>Yale</italic> in 1943, then served in the Marines until 1945. After the war, he reported for <italic>New York Times</italic> on the early UN, joined <italic>Lehman</italic> as an analyst, and later worked at <italic>General American Investors</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>. He became a general partner at <italic>Goldman</italic> in 1959 and a limited partner in 1977. From 1961, he chaired <italic>General American Investors</italic> until 1995 and remained a director until his death in 2002.  Since Helen Lehman Goodhart\u2019s cousin Helen Lewisohn Lehman married Benjamin Buttenwieser, the latter was a <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner, and their son, Lawrence, a lawyer, directed <italic>General\u00a0American\u00a0</italic>from 1967 until replacing Altschul as Chair in 1995.\nAs more partners left <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2014with Otto Jeidels joining <italic>Bank of America</italic> as Vice Chair of General Finance in 1943 and James Jackson resigning to head <italic>Continental Bank & Trust Co</italic> in 1944\u2014WWII disrupted Meyer\u2019s former partners, George Murnane and Jean Monnet. As Monnet fought to liberate France during WWII, Meyer hired Murnane to build <italic>Lazard</italic> New York. By 1945, Meyer centralized <italic>Lazard</italic> New York and shuttered stock brokerage distribution branch offices that Altschul had opened in Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia.\nIn 1935, Governor Herbert Lehman\u2019s grandniece wed Joseph Cullman, whose father was a cousin of <italic>Paul Weiss</italic>\u2019 Weiss and <italic>Macy</italic>\u2019s Straus families and mother descended from Austrian tobacco monopolist H\u00f6nig. While Joseph joined <italic>Webster Tobacco Co</italic>\u2014which his father\u2019s acquired during the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic>\u2014his brother married a Bloomingdale heiress in 1938. By 1957, Joseph led <italic>Phillip Morris</italic> tobacco. After the turn of the century, Straus cousins kinterlinked with the Abraham, Lehman, and Kuhn families, and with the Guggenheim, Sachs, and Warburg families during WWI. \nSince Sachs-in-law <italic>Macy</italic> heir Nathan Straus Jr later the director of America\u2019s <italic>Housing Authority</italic> under FDR and a New York State senator, purchasing WMCA radio station in 1943, his son Peter married the niece of <italic>New York Times</italic> publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger by 1950, but mostly devoted himself to WMCA. Neither did the Warburgs fall behind. Since Gerald Schiff Warburg married into Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s daughter in 1933, his niece Felicia Schiff Warburg married RCA\u2019s Robert Sarnoff by 1949. (By 1970, Felicia divorced Sarnoff and married fellow divorcee FDR Jr.)\nAfter <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast</italic> heir Benjamin Bradlee and Jean Saltonstall divorced in 1955, Bradlee became the Executive Editor of the <italic>Washington Post</italic> from 1965 to 1992. Meanwhile, Jean Saltonstall\u2019s sister married Erlanger-cousin August Belmont IV, who became President and Chair of <italic>Dillon</italic><italic> </italic>after<italic> </italic>Arkansas-born Charles McCain\u2014former president of <italic>Chase</italic> NB and <italic>United Light & Power Co</italic>\u2014resigned in 1951. Since <italic>Consolidated Edison</italic> Anthony Brady\u2019s great-grandson Nicholas Brady joined <italic>Dillon</italic> after graduating <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business in 1954, he became Chair in 1973 following Belmont.\nDescended from Katz Court Jews, Nicolas Gunzburg was born in Paris and settled in America in 1934. After a stint in Hollywood, Gunzburg joined <italic>Harper</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Bazaar</italic> fashion team in the early 1940s as perhaps the only male fashion editor in the world. After joining <italic>Town & Country</italic> magazine, he discovered model Lauren Bacall and designer Bill Blass before becoming its editor-in-chief in 1947. By 1949, he moved to <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast</italic>\u2019s<italic> Vogue</italic> as fashion editor, where he mentored Calvin Klein and other designers. Never marrying, Gunzburg\u2019s longest relationships was with Paul Sherman, his partner for over two decades.\nSince Christian Ernest Mercier joined Albert Petsche and formed <italic>Union d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Electricit\u00e9</italic> PUHC, he married Marguerite Dreyfu\u00df, the widow of Adolphe Reinach, niece of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df, and cousin-in-law of Worms and Lazard in 1929. Since Albert Petsche\u2019s son Maurice married Simone Lazard in 1937, he negotiated German reparations after WWII and progressed in the French Ministry. Although <italic>Union d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Electricit\u00e9</italic> was nationalized then, Mercier was a director of <italic>Suez</italic> and other boards. \nHis Huguenot son-in-law, <italic>Mirabaud</italic>-cousin Wilfrid Baumgartner led <italic>Cr\u00e9dit National</italic> from 1936 until his arrest by the Germans in 1943, when he was imprisoned in concentration camps. After WWII, Baumgartner resumed his career, Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs Maurice Petsche appointed him Governor of BDF in 1949. He also held key international roles, including directorships at BIS and <italic>Bank of Algeria & Tunisia</italic>. While Wilfrid\u2019s brother Richard worked at oil giants <italic>Lille-Bonni\u00e8res</italic> and <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles</italic>, brother Philippe married Schneider cousins <italic>Dollfus-Mieg</italic>, renowned textile manufacturers. \nIn 1949, Pierre Weill and Andr\u00e9 Meyer reopened <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, rehiring Jean Bloch-Lain\u00e9 and other partners. Likewise, Leon Lambert returned to Belgium and took control of <italic>Lambert</italic> and <italic>Louis-</italic><italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> restarted her Parisian commercial bank in 1953. By then, Lazard-in-law Pierre Wertheim returned to France and hired Antoine Bernheim to reorg <italic>Bourjois</italic> and <italic>Chanel</italic>. Born to a Halphen Goudchaux descended lawyer who was friendly with Pierre Wertheim, Antoine\u2019s parents perished in Auschwitz during WWII. Evading capture, Bernheim completed a law in 1945. By 1947, his brother married Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfu\u00df\u2019s granddaughter. \nAfter several years organizing communication services for Wertheim, Bernheim joined his uncle\u2019s real estate brokerage and then management consulting until Andr\u00e9 Meyer offered him a <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris partnership in 1967, which Bernheim bought using his share in his family\u2019s real estate empire. And in 1952, Pierre Wertheim\u2019s son divorced his wife, who married  a son of <italic>Pinaud</italic><italic> </italic>perfumer Jacques Heilbronn, related to the Goldschmidt-Goldet and Lazard families. \nNot closely related to Andr\u00e9 Meyer, Raoul Meyer and Max Heilbronner began rebuilding<italic> </italic>their lives and <italic>Galeries Lafayette</italic>. In 1947, \u00c9tienne Moulin, who saved Heilbronner\u2019s life in Buchenwald and married his daughter, joined them. Within two decades, <italic>Galeries </italic>was one of Europe\u2019s five largest department stores. <italic>Galeries</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic>long-time competitor, <italic>Printemps</italic>, sought investment in the early 1950s, but <italic>Lyonnais</italic> refused. <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris offered the required funds.\nSince Rene Mayer parted with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris during WWII, he became Secretary of Communications in General Henry Giraud\u2019s provisional government in 1943, he was appointed Finance Minister in 1948 and curbed inflation by devaluing the <italic>franc</italic> against the advice of IMF. Despite obtaining approval from the National Assembly to become PM in 1949, he faced challenges in forming a Cabinet and subsequently resigned. \nAs Finance Minister again in 1951, his austere budget helped topple Rene Pleven\u2019s government. After a governmental crisis in 1953, Mayer briefly represented the Radical Socialists as PM. Several years after, Pierre Mend\u00e9s-France\u2014a Katz cousin descended from Gomperz and Brandeis families who married a Cr\u00e9mieux, connecting him to the Alphand\u00e9ry, Gradis, and Lazard families\u2014also briefly served as PM.\nSince Guy Rothschild convinced his father \u00c9douard, the Head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, to hire his Christian tutor Ren\u00e9 Fillon, the latter served as Attorney-in-Fact of<italic> Rothschild</italic> Paris from 1940 through WWII. Afterward, he helped the family revalue the bank in 1946 and to pass leadership from \u00c9douard to Guy. As Fillon became General Director, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and<italic> Pe\u00f1arroya</italic> expanded overseas oil and mineral exploration, Andr\u00e9 Goulin acquired a 25% stake in the aryanized <italic>Works of Marseille</italic> PUHC in 1948. \nSo, <italic>Works of Marseille</italic>\u2019s board, excluding Goulin, formed an association to consolidate shareholder support. This successfully led Goulin to sell his shares to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and resign from the board. Along with Fillon and his associate at <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, Gaston Vagogne, new board directors included Auguste Det\u0153uf, who was President of <italic>Alsthom</italic> and <italic>General Union of Electrical Construction</italic>; \u00c9tienne Genies, President of<italic> French Thomson Houston</italic>; Edmond Roux, director of <italic>Est-Lumi\u00e8re</italic> and VP of <italic>Works of Marseille</italic>; and Joseph Thuillier, a former director of <italic>Co du Gaz de Paris</italic> and FORCLUM. <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and <italic>Chargeurs R\u00e9unis </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> sent Samuel-Lajeunesse, Chief Engineer of <italic>Mines Corps</italic>, later replaced by Pierre Gr\u00e9zell.\nAfter \u00c9douard Rothschild died in 1954, when a minority shareholder threatened to contest control of <italic>Nord</italic>. To secure his position, Guy established <italic>Nord</italic> IHC, which pooled family investments into major companies like <italic>Shell</italic>, <italic>NICKEL</italic>, and <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic>. Fillon convinced Guy to recruit his co-religionist Georges Pompidou in 1954. Born to a modest family, Pompidou had married Claude Cahour, whose uncle was Administrator of French communications agency <italic>Havas</italic> before WWI. \nAfter letting him reorg <italic>Transocean </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>, Pompidou organized and led aluminum transport shipper<italic> Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Navale de la Sanaga</italic>. Within a year, Guy appointed Pompidou Director, with seats on the boards of <italic>Nord</italic>, <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic>, <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic>, <italic>Co Africaine d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Entreprises Maritimes</italic>, <italic>Co Europ\u00e9enne des C\u00e9r\u00e9ales</italic>, and Saharan oil projects. However, as Pompidou became PM under General-turned-President Charles Gaulle in 1962\u2014ultimately succeeding him in 1969 until his death in 1974\u2014Guy became Chair of <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic>, the first Rothschild to personally manage one of the family\u2019s businesses.\nFollowing Pompidou at <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, Michel Boissieu had been Secretary-General of <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya </italic>from 1955. While Michel had married a descendant of Isaac Orchel in 1940, his fourth cousin once removed Jean married Gaulle\u2019s daughter in 1946. Jean\u2019s third cousin Charles-Albert Boissieu\u2014who had married a sister-in-law of Schneider nephew Jacques Ganay in the 1920s\u2014was Deputy Director of <italic>Schneider</italic><italic> </italic>since 1937 and became Managing Partner of <italic>Hottinguer</italic> from 1954, Chair and CEO of <italic>Creusot</italic> in 1960, as he rose to Manager of <italic>Schneider</italic>, and Administrator soon after, and then Chair of <italic>Commercial Bank of Paris</italic>. \nLike Jacques Ganay was a Heine descendant, his nephews married fellow Christian aristocratic Wendel cousins descended from Bischoffsheim in 1946 and Heine in 1955. Back in the 1930s, Ganay\u2019s brother Eudes married Magdeleine\u2014a great granddaughter of rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> founder Ernest Go\u00fcin and Pereire and Fould cousin Anna Rodrigues\u2014her sibling wed <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s David Weil\u2019s cousin once removed. By 1958, Pierre Weill\u2019s daughter married a descendant Roland Go\u00fcin Solages.\nAnd since Christian mining engineer Jules Aubrun left <italic>Schneider</italic>\u2019s <italic>Creusot</italic> for <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in 1929, he represented her in steel enterprises, including <italic>Batignolles</italic>. In 1945, he joined the board of <italic>Paribas</italic> and held the post until his death in 1959, after which Weill joined <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 board.\nWhile Roland Solages\u2019 uncle Guy presided over <italic>Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Industrielle</italic><italic> </italic><italic>La H\u00e9nin</italic>, he partnered with former Inspector of Finances Jack Frances, who developed the consumer credit firms, including <italic>COGEFIMO</italic> with <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. <italic>Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>directorate included Paul Thomasson, who administered <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in the 1940s before aryanization and joined <italic>Indochine</italic> as Deputy General Manager in 1950. In 1963, <italic>Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>merged with <italic>Banque de l\u2019Union des Mines</italic> to form <italic>Union des Mines</italic>-<italic>La H\u00e9nin</italic>, and succeeded Solages as President. He secured financing through a banking pool including <italic>Suez</italic> and <italic>Indochine</italic> and formed alliances with <italic>Monod</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Fran\u00e7ais</italic>, <italic>Vernes</italic>, <italic>La Paix</italic>, and <italic>Abeille</italic>.\nHero of the French Resistance, General Charles Gaulle\u2019s mother descended from the northern industrial Kolb-Bernard family. His brother Pierre entered <italic>Parisienne</italic> after WWI, later becoming Deputy Director as well as director of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Courtage d\u2019Assurances</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re et Financi\u00e8re Africaine</italic>, and others. Co-heading <italic>Parisienne</italic> Lyon, Pierre was arrested for resistance efforts in 1943, but survived until 1959 as Charles became President. While Charles\u2019 son had married a Henriette Montalembert\u2014whose fifth cousin once removed Joseph Montalembert married into the Wendel family in 1929\u2014and daughter married Jean Boissieu.\nWhile Maurice Petsche was promoted to France\u2019s Minister of State in 1951, he died shortly after. By 1953, his widow Simone Goldschmidt Lazard, married Jacquinot, then Minister of Overseas France, who supported gradual colonial liberalization. As President, Charles Gaulle formed a government at the end of the decade, he included Louis Jacquinot, Wilfrid Baumgartner and his cousin Maurice Murville, who married <italic>Mirabaud</italic> heiress (which <italic>Parisienne </italic>bought in 1953), was a the brother-in-law of a <italic>Fraissinet</italic> <italic>Shipper</italic> director, and served as Gaulle\u2019s last PM; Albin Chalandon, with multiple connections to <italic>Commercial Bank of Paris</italic>; Michel Debr\u00e9, son-in-law of a <italic>Wendel</italic> heiress; and Fran\u00e7ois Missoffe. \nMissoffe\u2019s Vice Admiral father and uncle were early <italic>Lever</italic> and <italic>Unilever</italic> managers and directors. Missoffe wed a Wendel Vitry descended from Thellusson whose cousin married a Laborde Seilli\u00e8re. His sister wed <italic>Paribas</italic> Director Maurice Rambuteau in 1954, a son of Count of Rambuteau, who died for France in deportation, and a daughter of French Princess Marguerite d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 brother married Louis Tronc, President of <italic>Nationale</italic> from 1947 until he became a senator in 1957. \nAnother Wendel Vitry sister married Jean Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet, whose roles ranged from Chair of can-maker <italic>Carnaud</italic> to the French Secretary General in 1976. After Jean\u2019s brother married a Hottinguer in 1958, another brother Michel joined <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1961 following <italic>Harvard</italic> Business. From Executive Assistant, he soon became Deputy Director, and continued rising. And while a Wendel heiress married director of<italic> Comptoir</italic> and <italic>Union des Mines-H\u00e9nin</italic> Count Pierre C\u00e9lier, <italic>Lyonnais</italic> directors included a Schneider and the presidents of <italic>Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc</italic> and <italic>Air Liquide</italic> around 1960.\nMeanwhile, FDR considered cartels and private monopolies as a threat to democracy and free markets. In 1944, he urged hist Secretary of State to curb cartel in foreign commerce, specifically mentioning <italic>Farben</italic> as an example of the dangers of cartels. Though he died 1945, his supporters continued his mission. FDR\u2019s banker interests also remained. As Cyrus Eaton funded his campaign in the last days of the election, President Truman continued listening to <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Weinberg and <italic>Sullivan </italic>partner John Dulles, who increasingly advised the State Department. Likewise, he appointed Averell Harriman<italic> </italic>Ambassador to England<italic>, </italic>and then Commerce Secretary. \nMarxism fears also spread domestically. When Congress established <italic>Atomic Energy Commission</italic> (\u201cAEC\u201d) in 1946, Truman appointed then-head of TVA, John Lilienthal, as Chair. But Tennessee\u2019s senator temporarily blocked Lilienthal because his parents were Czech born. While Strauss-Darmstadt briefly returned to <italic>Kuhn</italic>, he soon resigned as Truman appointed him to AEC as a member.\nIn 1947, <italic>Chase</italic> hired Hermann Volz, whose family had immigrated to America in the 1920s. Initially focused on setting up military banking facilities, Volz played a pivotal role in expanding <italic>Chase</italic> Frankfurt\u2019s banking operations alongside <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Citi</italic> during Germany\u2019s rise as a major economic powerhouse. \nAlso that year, Aldrich opened <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s only other overseas branch through the 1950s in the gold-trading hub of Beirut. Since heading <italic>Allied Relief Fund </italic>during WWII, Chair of <italic>Chase</italic> Winthrop Aldrich helped organize and chair relief campaigns into <italic>National War Fund</italic> after the war. As president of <italic>International Chamber of Commerce</italic>, Aldrich proposed to reconstruct Europe, and was active in winning support for the <italic>Marshall Plan</italic>. \nSince serving as Assistant Secretary of War for Air, <italic>Brown Harriman</italic> partner\u2014and in-law of the Brown family\u2014 Robert Lovett became General Marshall\u2019s Under Secretary of State from 1947.   That year, Brigadier General William Draper Jr he was named Under Secretary of War, becoming Under Secretary of the Army a few weeks later when the War and Navy Departments were unified under Secretary of Defense James Forrestal. Draper led decartelization efforts in post-WWII Germany, oversaw the revival of heavy industry and steel production. \nHis significant contribution to the <italic>Marshall Plan</italic> played a crucial role in the economic recovery of both Germany and Japan before returning to <italic>Dillon</italic> in 1949. Also that year, <italic>Chase</italic> SVP Eugene Black Jr took over as <italic>BANK</italic>\u2019s <italic>International</italic> <italic>Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> (\u201cIBRD\u201d), the third since Eugene Meyer, but who remained as chair until 1963. One of the few Jews involved in rebuilding Germany was Lehman-in-law Benjamin Buttenwieser, who left <italic>Kuhn</italic> to assist High Commissioner for Germany John McCloy in 1947. Frustrated with German antisemitism, he retired to focus on domestic politics by 1952.\nSince Edward Stotesbury died in 1938, Edward Hopkinson became Senior Partner of <italic>Drexel</italic>, the former <italic>Morgan </italic>Philadelphia. A descendant of a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia-born and <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> educated Hopkinson joined the law firm <italic>Dickson Beitler McCouch</italic> in 1910, became a Partner in 1921, and switched to <italic>Drexel</italic> in 1926. He was also a partner at <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>, and <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris until 1940. He served as Chair of <italic>Philadelphia Transportation Co</italic> from 1953 to 1962 and was a director of <italic>Baldwin Locomotive </italic>and <italic>Westinghouse</italic>. \nA year after Hopkinson joined President Truman\u2019s Foreign Trade Financing Advisory Committee in 1946, his daughter wed Jean Villechaise. Born in Toulon, France, Villechaise began his career as a Legal Advisor to IBRD from 1947, joined <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris as VP in 1952, and became a director of <italic>DuPont</italic> France in 1959. In 1948, <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris Chair Nelson Jay\u2019s son married an Astor\u2014and so in-laws of the Langhornes, Roosevelts, and others\u2014and soon joined <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>. \nLikewise, an extended cousin of Biddle-in-law Horatio Lloyd of <italic>Drexel</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic>, Henry Wingate was a <italic>Sullivan</italic> lawyer from 1929 until joining <italic>NICKEL</italic> as Assistant Secretary in 1935, and became President in 1954, and Chair from 1960, with directorships at <italic>STEEL</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic>. The Biddle and Drexel families were also kinterlinked with <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>New York</italic>\u2019s Baker family,  including George Baker II\u2019s wife Frances Paul Munn, a descendant of Anthony Drexel and <italic>Drexel</italic> partner James Paul. Through the marriage of Baker\u2019s sister to John Schiff, the family connected with <italic>Kuhn</italic><italic> </italic>from 1934. A descendant of Anthony Drexel, John Fell had joined <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1937 and was admitted to partnership three years later.\n<italic>Morgan</italic> affiliates held key posts in American foreign policy. Edward Stettinius Jr, son of a <italic>Morgan</italic> partner and former <italic>STEEL</italic> executive, served as Secretary of State from 1944 to 1945. He was followed by James Byrnes, a director at <italic>Morgan</italic>-backed <italic>Newmont Mining</italic>, until 1947. Dean Acheson, a partner at <italic>Morgan</italic>-associated <italic>Covington Burling</italic> law firm, took the post in 1949. While <italic>Morgan</italic> financier Lewis Douglas became Ambassador to Britain in 1947, George Perkins, son of a top <italic>Morgan</italic> associate, served as Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs.\nAfter <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Russell Leffingwell became Chair of <italic>Council on Foreign Relations </italic>in 1946, <italic>Sullivan</italic> Partner Allen Dulles became President. After <italic>Morgan </italic>NB Chair Thomas Lamont died in 1948, Leffingwell took over that role. As <italic>Council</italic> members Dean Acheson, William Clayton, and George Kennan drafted the <italic>Marshall Plan</italic> to reconstruct Europe, Congress allocated $12 billion to the effort by March 1948. Since Allen Dulles presided over <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic>, David Rockefeller\u2014whose extended cousin had married Allen\u2019s brother John\u2014became the youngest member elected to the <italic>Council</italic>\u2019s board in 1949. \nAlong with being a senior Partner of <italic>Sullivan</italic>, John Dulles was Chair of <italic>Rockefeller Foundation </italic>from 1950. Their sister oversaw the State Department\u2019s Berlin desk from 1952. Dean Acheson\u2019s daughter Mary married William, son of Harvey Bundy, a partner at <italic>Choate Hall Stewart</italic>, and a Director of <italic>Merchants</italic> NB of Boston. William\u2019s brother McGeorge worked with Thomas Dewey\u2019s 1948 campaign team and served as President of <italic>Ford Foundation</italic>, and affiliated with <italic>Council</italic>. McGeorge\u2019s sister Katherine married <italic>OIL</italic> heirs Auchincloss.\nAs Britain granted Israel independence under Jewish leadership in 1948, Iraq cut off oil to Israel, thus crippling Europe\u2019s direct Iraqi oil refining. During Israel\u2019s <italic>War of Independence </italic>from 1948, Elias Sassoon joined Israel\u2019s government as an advisor and became Chair of <italic>Sassoon</italic> with a year. Amidst violence of 1948, Sephardi bank family<italic> Safra</italic> fled Syria to Brazil. By then, America implemented the <italic>Marshall Plan</italic>. Including nearly a year of airlifting supplies to Soviet-blockaded Berlin in 1948, two-thirds of American aid to Europe was coal. As Abs decided on the allocation of <italic>Marshall</italic> aid for Germany, he proposed and headed the credit institution for reconstruction, which immediately aided the energy and mining industries by 1949. However, oil majors overcharged the <italic>Marshall </italic>buyers, soon spurring antitrust. \nIn Japan, the American occupation increased state controls, including coal production and distribution. Liquidating the zaibatsu-controlled coal association, Americans installed a state firm designed to purchase, sell, and distribute strategic goods to stabilize the economy and deconcentrate the marketplace by blocking the zaibatsu interests. While America also imposed BA1938- and FA1933-like laws, Japan\u2019s antitrust law focused on increasing market access against exclusive practices instead of suppressing zaibatsu. \nAlthough American antitrustors blamed bankers in the federal government for not liquidating firms, the start of the <italic>Cold War</italic> forced America to reassess weakening potential allies. While the Communist Party won Hungary\u2019s 1947 election and nationalized industries, including banking, culminating in the establishment of <italic>National Saving Bank</italic> in 1949, in China, the Communist takeover occurred through the 1940s until Mao Zedong\u2019s forces emerged victorious in 1949, forcing Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s government to retreat to Taiwan. \nSince FDR sought to set quotas with Britain for petroleum producing and consuming countries but abandoned the course as oil majors recalled DOJ\u2019s suit for abiding to TA1933. After the Allied victory, Congress lifted crude price controls in 1946. While FPC limited natural gas, coal output set a record as oil prices doubled. Coal strikes and shortages spread to steel, PUs, and oil. As coalers merged, Truman hiked steel salaries in 1946, but Congress eliminated price controls in 1947. \nAs Congress allowed Truman to direct FRS credit controls, recession struck before cheap oil imports. Amidst the crisis, banks linked with industrialists across religious lines. <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> hired Martin Shea, a Catholic <italic>Dartmouth</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic>-educated lawyer, whose father was President of a coal distributor. Likewise, <italic>Kuhn</italic> hired the Christian Joseph Dilworth. Since Dilworth\u2019s great-grandfather founded a Pittsburgh steel mill, the company affiliated with Eaton\u2019s <italic>Republic Steel</italic> while the family kinterlinked with the Carnegies\u2014and so related to <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic>\u2019s Rockefellers\u2014and Michigan iron Kaufman family\u2014and so related to <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Drexel family of Philadelphia. \nWhile UST and FRS disagreed on short-term rates, crude oil prices rose sharply. Amidst the inflation, strikes broke out in refineries and aggravated the demand-supply gap. So, Congress enacted anti-inflation legislation in 1947 to exempt oil cartels from antitrust prosecution with DOJ-approved agreements and amended the <italic>National Labor Relations </italic>law to weaken bargaining power. FRS curbed inflation by subjecting UST deposits to required reserves and raising them to the legal maximum until Congress authorized further increases. \nServing as FRS Chair since 1934, Marriner Eccles\u2019 fight to restore FRS\u2019 independence resulted in his removal from the FRS chairmanship by Truman in 1948, though he continued as a Governor until 1951. Following their Washington roles, both Eccles and Elbert Bennett returned to <italic>First Security</italic> BHC, which continued growing. Truman replaced Eccles as FRS Chair with <italic>Scott Paper</italic> CEO and FRS <italic>Philadelphia</italic> director Thomas McCabe. \nWith the death of another FRS governor, Truman appointed Oliver Powell. A Strong descendant and fourth cousin-in-law of the Rockefellers, Powell worked for <italic>Citi</italic> Petrograd after WWI and joined FRS <italic>Minneapolis</italic> in 1920, became head of Research in 1927, and VP in 1936. He served as a FRS governor until 1952, when he became President of FRS <italic>Minneapolis</italic>. Without markets for distressed debt amidst the rising bankruptcies, SEC allowed <italic>Atlas </italic>to take minority positions in NOC-laden contractors. \nAnd following long-standing complaints from <italic>Stuart</italic> and <italic>Eaton</italic>, DOJ sued seventeen NYSE securities brokers \u2014not <italic>Stuart</italic>, <italic>Eaton</italic>, or<italic> Lazard</italic> New York, especially since Andr\u00e9 Meyer shuttered distribution branches to focus on dealmaking\u2014for cartelizing securities without competitive bidding, Since FA1933 forbid bank-like deposit-taking, securities firms stratified into a range from business models, including advisory and dealmaking, capital markets, and high-volume retail brokerage. Although there was overlap, the former focused on high-touch service, while the latter two were capital and labor intensive. \nLike <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s small and advisory-focused structure, <italic>Lehman</italic> operated without trading. At the other extreme, <italic>Merrill</italic> and <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> high-volume brokerage required numerous branch offices to cater to a retail clientele. In between, <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>Salomon</italic>, and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> provided capital markets services ranging from underwriting to trading. Although FA1933 forbid investment bankers from interlocking directorates with banks, legal relationships remained unchanged. So, as investment bankers resigned, lawyers represented their interests.\nFrom 1947 through the 1950s, <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s most lucrative work was in antitrust defense as <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Dean acted as the lead counsel against DOJ\u2019s brokerage case. The individual clients continued to rely on partner law firms. <italic>Sullivan </italic>represented <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>Lehman</italic>, <italic>First Boston</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic>. <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Seligman</italic> retained <italic>Cravath</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic> hired <italic>Shearman Sterling</italic>, and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> chose <italic>Davis Polk</italic>. Work for these law forms grew with AA1950. Having blamed big business for Nazism in Europe, Congress used the same fears to remove the asset purchase exemption from AA1914 and include banks. Since AA1914 banned directors from interlocking boards of competing companies, a surge of violations led DOJ to initiate extrajudicial enforcement to compel voluntary resignations. \nBut antitrust law could not breach marriage or employment. As <italic>Ford</italic> and <italic>Firestone</italic> heirs married while in college in 1946, they solidified car and tire production bonds without the need for corporate action. That year, Wickliffe Shreve, an extended cousin of the <italic>Riggs</italic>, <italic>Colgate</italic>, and Auchincloss families, left <italic>Lehman</italic> for <italic>Hayden</italic> <italic>Stone</italic>. Soon after, Rockefeller and <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> heirs married. So did <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Dorothy Schiff with a Sonneborn of Baltimore, with interests in oil refining and textiles from Hamburg to Baltimore, with cousin in-laws including the Guggenheim, Lehman, Salomon, and Mack families.\nSince <italic>COALH</italic> bought Mellon\u2019s <italic>Pittsburg Coal</italic> in 1945, becoming the nation\u2019s largest colliery, Pennsylvania legalized branch banking in 1946, allowing the Mellon-controlled <italic>Union Trust </italic>of Pittsburgh to consolidate with <italic>Mellon</italic> NB to form <italic>Mellon </italic>NB<italic> & Trust</italic><italic> </italic>under Frank Deaton. As the Mellons merged <italic>Mellon Securities</italic> into <italic>First Boston</italic>, they gained non-voting shares and aligned with Rockefeller and Boston financial interests. With the largest capital in America, <italic>First Boston</italic> assuming investment banking for <italic>ALUM</italic>, <italic>Gulf Oil</italic>, other Mellon companies. \nFrom 1947, <italic>First Boston </italic>elected James Coggeshall for President. Born in Newport, Rhode Island, like generations of <italic>Belmont</italic> cousin Perry, Coggeshall descended from Rhode Island\u2019s first governor and related to Abraham Redwood\u2019s wife. Since<italic> Kuhn-</italic>heir Joseph Loeb\u2019s stepson joined <italic>First Boston</italic> London as Chair in 1935, Seligman cousin Robert Mayer, a former <italic>AMAX</italic> executive, took over from 1949. (Another bank director was a Rothschild and Morgan cousin.) \nThrough WWII, <italic>ALUM</italic> accepted <italic>Kaiser</italic> and <italic>Reynolds</italic> as aluminum producers, though <italic>ALUM</italic> set prices. While <italic>ALUM</italic> dominated aluminum as AA1914 prohibited prevented industrial mergers.  Since FDR packed the Court with \u2018trustbusters\u2019, DOJ failed to dissolve <italic>ALUM</italic> as justices recused themselves. <italic>ALUM</italic> assured Allied victory in WWII, but FDR privatized wartime Caribbean aluminum for competition, allowing <italic>ALUM</italic> to win against DOJ in 1951. \nWhile <italic>TransAmerica</italic>\u2019s <italic>Bank of America</italic> extended credits to <italic>Kaiser</italic> through the war, <italic>Bank of America</italic> lacked investment banking capacity, and so <italic>Kaiser</italic> turned to <italic>First Boston</italic> for further financing. By 1953, the big four Wall Street insurers had loaned to <italic>Kaiser</italic>\u2019s metal companies, <italic>Mellon</italic> NB acted as trustee, and <italic>First Boston</italic> underwrote all of <italic>Kaiser</italic>\u2019s bonds. The following year, Andrew Mellon\u2019s granddaughter, whose father was the British ambassador, married Edward Schiff Warburg\u2019s Prue nephew. And in 1956, a Rockefeller married a <italic>First Boston</italic> heiress.\nOther mixed religion heirs also acted as extended bridges. While <italic>Morgan</italic> partners William Mitch resigned to head Cincinnati\u2019s <italic>Central Trust Co</italic> in 1949, his son joined <italic>Chemical</italic> NB and married Frances Binger in 1953 as Hunnewell merged into <italic>Smith Barney</italic>. While her Hunnewell Sorchan mother was a Christian Bostonian and extended cousin of <italic>Morgan</italic>, her Binger uncle married an extended <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> cousin.  By 1956, Frances\u2019 cousin Louisa Hunnewell married Michael Clemm, whose father was a German baron and maternal grandfather, Harry Green, had led <italic>International Banking Corp</italic> until acquisition by <italic>Citi</italic> and then served as VP. Likewise, lawyers bridged religious barriers for bankers.\nAlthough <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Seligman</italic> long committed to <italic>Cravath</italic>, the other Jewish banks retained <italic>Sullivan</italic>. In 1868, the patent law firm associated with Alex Hamilton Jr and Secretary of State William Seward hired a converted Mendes-descendant as a railroad expert. Although the latter died childless, and the firm crystallized as <italic>Cravath</italic> in 1907, <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Seligman</italic> retained only her services for decades. Of financial law firms, <italic>Sullivan </italic>had the most Jewish partners, all of whom were related to Jaretzki. Back in 1884, Cromwell hired Sullivan\u2019s son George and his exceptional Jewish classmate, Alfred Jaretzki, who became Managing Partner after Cromwell\u2019s death. \nBy 1914, <italic>Sullivan </italic>hired <italic>Seligman</italic>-cousin Eustice Seligman, whose father was a <italic>Columbia </italic>economics professor. Within three years, Eustice married Jaretzki\u2019s daughter. Of the more typical Christian partners, <italic>Sullivan </italic>marriages linked with<italic> </italic>clients. Since Edwin Webster\u2014Boston Brahmin son <italic>Kidder</italic>\u2019s former CEO\u2014received a capital injection from <italic>Morgan </italic>and added his <italic>Harvard</italic> classmate Albert Gordon to <italic>Kidder</italic>\u2019s board from <italic>Goldman</italic>, Gordon married Mary Rousmaniere in 1934. \nWhile Rousmaniere\u2019s father graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> Law and worked at <italic>Ropes Gray Gorham</italic>, and held executive positions at <italic>Grace</italic> NB, <italic>Cabot</italic>, and <italic>Lawrence</italic>, her aunt married <italic>Harvard</italic> professor Arthur Stone Dewing, who served as president of <italic>Rockingham</italic> NB and more than a dozen New England PUs. Rousmaniere\u2019s  sister Frances married <italic>Sullivan </italic>lawyer Richard Storrs\u2014whose father was a former pastor and director of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Orange</italic> and <italic>Orange Savings Bank</italic> of New Jersey\u2014in 1938. Storrs made partner in 1945 and dealt with <italic>Kidder </italic>and other securities firms in underwriting equity and debt offerings for decades.\nSince the end of WWII, presidents Truman and Eisenhower challenged the restrictive immigration enacted after the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>. Despite their endeavors, they obtained little relief for refugees. Amidst the Cold War, Congress passed the <italic>McCarran-Walter Act of 1952</italic>, reinforcing exclusionary national origins quotas established in 1924. This legislation, despite President Truman\u2019s veto attempt, also introduced new restrictions based on ideology and sexual preference. \nLikewise, most law firms discriminated against Jews. At the time, most large law firms were in New York City. Off the seventeen \u2018large\u2019 law firms across the country, there were three in the South (Texas), four each in the Mid-Atlantic and West Coast, five in the Midwest, and only one in New England. Antisemitism fostered entrepreneurship. Born into a family of Jewish German immigrants in Texas, Robert Strauss co-founded the energy-focused <italic>Akin Gump</italic> in 1945. That year, New York\u2019s mixed religious law firm,<italic> </italic><italic>Paul Weiss</italic>, leveraged their liberal politics to become the only major commercial large law firm with a named Jewish partner. \nAs a shortage of males during WWII led some firms to hire female lawyers, albeit in marginal areas of practice without a chance of partnership. <italic>Paul Weiss</italic> became the first to elect a female partner in 1946 and hire a Black associate in 1949. From 1950, <italic>Harvard </italic>Law<italic> </italic>began accepting women. Despite the emergence of such mixed-religious firms, White men\u2014mostly Protestant with single seats for Catholics and Jews\u2014continued to dominate both the elite law firms and the Court. Astronomer Cecilia Payne Gaposchkin became <italic>Harvard</italic>\u2019s first female tenured full professor in 1956. <italic>Harvard</italic> would not have a female Overseer until 1970.\nIn 1936, the New York Bar admitted one of the first women, Helen Lewisohn Lehman, wife of <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Buttenwieser. But if anything, discrimination grew after WWII even for elite women. Since the \u201cfathering the New York Bar\u201d, the Jones judicial dynasty donated land for Robert Moses to form <italic>Jones Beach</italic>. By 1934, heiress Mary Gardiner Jones earned a history degree from <italic>Wellesley</italic> and was an OSS analyst during WWII. After graduating <italic>Yale </italic>Law<italic> </italic>in 1948, fifty law firms rejected her for her gender before <italic>Donovan Leisure</italic> accepted her. She became a trial lawyer in DOJ\u2019s antitrust division in 1953. In one case, she prevented American watch manufacturers from joining a Swiss cartel.  Likewise, <italic>Merrill</italic> named Benjamin\u2019s sister, Katz-in-law Gertrude Buttenwieser Prins, as limited partner in 1944. \nThe largest Jewish law firm in 1950, <italic>Weil Gotshal</italic><italic> Manges</italic> was not active in finance for decades even though Gotshal\u2019s daughter married the son of <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Sidney Weinberg in 1952 and <italic>Kuhn</italic> hired Manges\u2019 son James in 1954. Sylvan Gotshal, a lawyer with roots in the textile industry, teamed up with Frank Weill to establish the law firm <italic>Weil Gotshal Manges</italic> in 1931. Gotshal fought against fashion piracy. Co-founder Frank Weil succeeded Judge Irving Lehman as President of the <italic>National Jewish Welfare Board</italic> in 1940 and played a key role in the <italic>United Service Organizations </italic>during WWII. \nWhile Jews became White (along with North Africans and Turks according to Department of Labor), growing Black and White inter-racial marriage remained scandalous. <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Arnstein cousins of San Francisco were models of civic responsibility. One of the cousins secretly wed a Black university lecturer and moved to Mexico. \nBut racism fostered Black entrepreneurship among the inter-connected Black \u2018talented tenth.\u2019 Since Richard Wright co-founded the first Black bank in the North, <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic> in Philadelphia with his children in 1920, his son Richard II became a Bishop of Kentucky and Tennessee. \nAnother son, Emmanuel, married Dorothy Bell. Graduating from <italic>Wharton</italic>, Dorothy worked at IRS, rising to the role of senior reviewer and instructor. In 1946, Dorothy co-founded <italic>Jack & Jill</italic>, a service club for Black women who faced exclusion from other organizations due to their race. Originating as a children\u2019s playgroup in 1938 <italic>Jack & Jill</italic>, in Philadelphia, it focused on offering social, cultural, and educational programs for Black children in White neighborhoods. \nAfter Richard Wright\u2019s death, in 1947, his son Richard II succeeded him as president of <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic>. With Emmanuel an executive, Dorothy helped as a bank director and corporate secretary. But as Reverend WC Williamson replaced Wright in 1952, Richard Jr returned in 1954, becoming president with his sister Harriet as VP. As Richard II resigned in 1956 due to church duties, the family failed to find Black investors and sold <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic> to Whites for millions. While new leadership expanded the bank, Philadelphia\u2019s Black community remained in poverty.\nSince JE Walker co-founded <italic>Universal </italic>LIC of Memphis in 1923, his son Maceo graduated from <italic>Fisk</italic> and received an MBA from NYU before marrying Harriett, the daughter of <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> educated Arkansas surgeon George Ish in 1938. By then, Harriett\u2019s cousin Jefferson Ish joined <italic>Supreme</italic> LIC, becoming the Agency Director, initiating mass marketing, which greatly grew <italic>Supreme</italic> and led to Ish becoming Vice Chair.\nBy WWII, only six Black-owned banks remained active, including Maggie Walker\u2019s <italic>Consolidated Bank & Trust</italic> (1903) and Herman Perry\u2019s <italic>Citizens Trust</italic> (1921).  During WWII, JE Walker spearheaded the purchase of $2 million in war bonds served as Chair of the <italic>War Bond Saving Club</italic>. As <italic>Universal </italic>LIC extended its operations to nine additional states, Walker founded <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> in 1946 on the site of Robert Church\u2019s <italic>Solvent Savings Bank & Trust</italic>, the first black-owned bank in Memphis. While Maceo became VP, Richard Wright\u2019s grandson Richard III became Cashier, and the bank rapidly expanded to encompass five branches. \nOther Black banks followed. After <italic>Douglass State Bank</italic> of Kansas City became the first Black-owned bank west of the Mississippi River in 1947, <italic>Broadway Federal Bank</italic> formed in Los Angeles to offer mortgages to Black veterans who were denied loans by White banks. Reverend Milton Weston was born in Tarboro, North Carolina, in 1910, the son and grandson of Episcopal priests. After graduating from <italic>Columbia </italic>in 1928, Weston led <italic>Saint-Philip\u2019s Episcopal Church</italic> in Harlem. After being denied a New York bank charter, Weston founded <italic>Carver </italic>under a federal charter in 1948 to address racial discrimination in lending by White banks.\nLike Wright, <italic>Supreme</italic> LIC\u2019s Henry Pace and Truman Gibson sold Black newspapers. A grandson of slaves, John Johnson met Harry Pace of <italic>Supreme</italic> LIC at an <italic>Urban League</italic> event in the late 1930s. While at <italic>Supreme</italic> with Truman Gibson and Earl Dickerson, Johnson became assistant editor of a newspaper. Dickerson guided him in local politics. In 1941, Johnson married Eunice Walker\u2014whose grandfather co-founded Talladega College for Baptist ministers, and acquainted with Booker Washington\u2014and founded <italic>Johnson Publishing</italic> a year later.\nWhile America courted decolonized nations, <italic>New Deal</italic> institutions from TVA to TBTA discriminated against Black labor, credit, and housing. Unlike Robert Moses, TVA\u2019s David Lilienthal was less racist than Tennessee. So did federally regulated cartels\u2014such as ICC\u2019s trucking certificates\u2014by favoring political patronage over market competition. As unions proliferated after 1937, White unions sought Black support to prevent Blacks from becoming strike-breakers. \nCeasing cheap labor practices Black union workers grew from 56,000 in 1930 to 600,000 by 1940 and 1,250,000 during WWII. Like the members of labor unions, leaders themselves spurred dynasties, included the Reuther brothers of UAW, John Lewis and his family in the <italic>United Mine Workers</italic>, and so on. However, majority-Black and Hispanic roles remained un-unionized and under-paid. <italic>TransAmerica</italic> was one of the few to service migrant farmworkers. By 1947, GE chaired Truman\u2019s Civil Rights Committee. \nLikewise, Truman appointed Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer in 1949 in appreciation for her campaigning in Republican Kansas. While the UST Secretary post continued to be held exclusively by White men for decades, the Treasurer role was reserved for women and focused on promoting economic development in underprivileged areas. Ralph Bunche, graduating from UCLA in 1927, earned a PhD from <italic>Harvard</italic>, and became Chair of Political Science at <italic>Howard</italic>. \nBy 1950, he became the first Black to win the <italic>Nobel Peace Prize</italic> for his mediation efforts in Israel. Bunche also made history as the first Black appointed to <italic>Harvard</italic>\u2019s Faculty of Arts & Sciences and served as an Overseer starting from 1959. By 1951, the number of Blacks in high-trust positions ranging from banks managers to board directors, particularly in New York City and Los Angeles, grew to nearly 500, with over half in Manhattan and sixteen in <italic>TransAmerica</italic> on the West Coast.\nIn Africa, skin color and gender were less important than culture. While West African markets continued to explicitly ban the sale of human flesh, Yoruba women gained wealth and status through their business acumen in trade. Some held capital exceeding \u00a320,000, with one woman\u2019s annual turnover with a major European trading firm reaching six figures. Other women secured credit lines for $9,000 of American tobacco. (In 1961, Governor Rockefeller\u2019s son Michael disappeared while exploring Guinea\u2019s Asmat region. Through the family attributed death to drowning, stories that the actual cause was cannibalism continued for decades.)\nAlthough western women had been relegated to homemaking, they soon became entered the labor market in force. Austro-Hungarian Jews deserve special mention. Hedwig Kiesler, born in Vienna to a <italic>Wiener </italic>manager (and possible Katz-descendant), fled to America in the 1930s, where she thrived in Hollywood as Hedy LaMarr and innovated radio signals. \nAround the same time, Josephine Mentzer, the niece of a Hungarian chemist, marketed face creams at <italic>Saks 5</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> Ave</italic> as Est\u00e9e Lauder, which she later incorporated. And George Rosenkranz, who fled Nazism to Mexico, helped invent birth control. After five years of safety trails, his company, <italic>Syntex</italic>, faced difficulty getting to market because of opposition from the Catholic Church after 1951. Despite bans on artificial contraception, the \u2018Pill\u2019 rapidly spread and transformed society.\nSince the Court supported the <italic>New Deal</italic> in the 1940s, Congress reinstated municipal bankruptcy law, advanced urban public housing, and conferred FHLB-like powers to <italic>Federal Farm Mortgage Corp</italic>. Likewise, the Court sanctioned collateralized leases without personal recourse in 1947. Real estate leases were not new but remained rare for decades. Having sold his fleet to <italic>Morgan </italic>at the turn of the century, British shipping magnate Sir John Ellerman hired Dudley Samuel to flip low rent and short leases until his death in 1933. \nAfter WWII, Charles Clore and other Brits took over properties valued at pre-WWII prices to lease at higher rates or sell to insurers. Born to immigrants from Lithuania, the entrepreneur married, in 1946, Francine Dreyfus Halphen, a granddaughter of Aaron Gubbay and Rachel Sassoon. Like Clore, Jewish real estate developers thrived in America since FA1933 virtually eliminated Jews from banks, insurers, and large. \nRedefining Manhattan\u2019s east side, <italic>Kuhn</italic> cousin Robert Moses parlayed <italic>authorities</italic> financing for the clearance of tenements and old buildings across New York City and approved sites for the 1,082 public housing projects built between 1945 and 1958, including <italic>Stuyvesant Town</italic>, <italic>Peter Cooper Village</italic>, and <italic>Co-op City</italic>. He also oversaw the development of <italic>Lincoln Center</italic>, <italic>New York Coliseum</italic>, and the <italic>United Nations Headquarters</italic>.\nOther Jewish New York City real estate developers included Sam Minskoff, his property manager Bernard Spitzer, and William Zeckendorf. The latter, related to the Seligmans through his cousin twice removed Emanuel Spiegelberg, and soon partnered with <italic>Lazard</italic>. Back in 1928, John Rockefeller Jr sought to develop an opera house in Manhattan. From 1931, he pivoted to commercial projects, including the RCA<italic> Building</italic> and RKO\u2019s <italic>Radio City Music Hall</italic> over the course of the 1930s. \nConsisting of fourteen buildings, <italic>Rockefeller Center</italic> was one of the largest privately funded projects of the time. By the 1940s, David Rockefeller and his brothers sought to restructure their major holdings, including <italic>Rockefeller Center</italic>, to generate income and increase value. As Disque Deane structured sale-leaseback agreements, Andr\u00e9 Meyer advised Rockefeller to invest in Zeckendorf\u2019s <italic>Roosevelt Field</italic> mall. \nWith Meyer and Zeckendorf developing real estate from DC\u2019s <italic>L\u2019Enfant Plaza</italic> to San Francisco\u2019s <italic>Embarcadero Center</italic>, Meyer became investment bankers for Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Chase</italic>. While Meyer sold interests to partners\u2014including Charles Engelhard, the Kennedys, and the Agnellis\u2014some had a voluntary obligation to reciprocally share profits. He seized deals even without partners. \nIn 1948, Andr\u00e9 Meyer, Ferdinand Eberstadt, Vincent Astor, and <italic>Rockefeller</italic> had a proposal to invest in a sisal plantation in northern Haiti from American investors using ECGD credits. After Nelson Loud\u2019s appraisal uncovered foreign securities, the valuation rose from $4 to 6.6 million. Despite Astor and <italic>Rockefeller</italic> withdrawing due to financial overextension and political concerns, respectively, Meyer and Eberstadt bought the plantation and quickly resold it to <italic>Haitian-American Sugar Co</italic> for over $10 million. \nPerhaps the most successful, was a mixed Jewish-Italian partnership from Brooklyn. The son of a Brooklyn grocer, Sol Goldman\u2014unrelated to <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2014began buying properties in Brooklyn in the 1930s with credit sourced from his father\u2019s business. Concurrently, the son of a local real estate and mortgage office, Alex DiLorenzo graduated <italic>Brooklyn Law School</italic>. In 1951, Goldman and DiLorenzo formalized a partnership, jointly acquiring of a six-hundred-unit apartment complex. Using properties as collateral for loans from <italic>Chase</italic> NB and other banks, <italic>Goldman DiLorenzo</italic> continued expanding, only starting purchases in Manhattan from 1955.\nAnd in Chicago. Born to German immigrants in Cincinnati, Louis Heymann moved to Chicago, and began his career at <italic>Morris</italic>, a packing house, rising through the ranks to become the VP. In 1906, he founded <italic>West Side Trust</italic> & SB while still working at <italic>Morris</italic> to finance the predominantly Jewish wholesale businesses around Wells Street at the edge of the Loop. \nOver the years, Heymann has served on the boards of financial institutions, including <italic>American Food Products</italic>, <italic>Liberty Trust & </italic>SB, and <italic>Fidelity Trust & </italic>SB. While Walter, Louis\u2019 son, later became President of <italic>West Side </italic><italic>Trust</italic> & SB, and joined <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic> on LaSalle Street, his Jewish excluded from holding the top post at the latter. Between the two posts, Walter became one of Chicago\u2019s few Jewish real estate bankers. After FA1933 outlawed interlocking bank directorships, Walter needed a new strategy.\nSince forming a relationship with <italic>Pritzker</italic> law firm in the 1920s, Chicago\u2019s <italic>Goldblatt</italic> discount department store flourished during the Great Depression. Through <italic>Goldblatt</italic>, Nicholas Pritzker\u2019s son Abram formed a relationship with Walter Heymann and obtained credit to buy real estate. After <italic>Pritzker</italic> pivoted from law to family investments in 1940, Abram\u2019s son Jay began acquiring troubled companies. \nAs Jay acquired <italic>Hyatt House</italic> at <italic>Los Angeles International Airport</italic> in 1957, he expanded <italic>Hyatt</italic> into a thriving chain of high-quality airport hotels hotel. Similarly, the sons of Russian Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn, Bob and Larry Tisch expanded their parent\u2019s hotel investments. Their pinnacle achievement came in 1956 with the construction of the $17 million <italic>Americana Hotel</italic> in Florida. \n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of 1948, 1953, & 1956</italic>\nTo promote domestic investment and control exchange rates, Britain required external financing for foreign investment. So, <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> sold Australian and Canadian mining ventures to local partners. Likewise, <italic>Kleinwort</italic> could not resume their acceptance business. Although most British bank partnerships had converted into limited firms\u2014like <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>\u2014or trusts\u2014like <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and <italic>Baring</italic>\u2014<italic>Kleinwort </italic>remain private until new tax laws made it difficult to build up reserves and incorporated in 1948. The Keswicks borrowed from London banks in the 1950s to centralize <italic>Jardine</italic> ownership before listing in Hong Kong in 1961.\nWhen Britain nationalized PUs while dismantling her Empire, ESCOM, South Africa\u2019s public PU, acquired <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>\u2019s mines PU. As local rule prevailed, strikes intensified racial segregation and the PU monopolization into ESCOM for the public interest. Only gold mine PUs remained private. Rhodesia\u2019s White regime likewise segregated farmland by race. \nWhile Norway developed Europe\u2019s largest independent oil tanker fleet by WWII, FX shortages in 1948 led her to ban ship imports. In Japan, collieries cartelized to industrialize with Iranian oil. Finland and India also rationed heat and electricity. In South Africa, <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> invested in coal assets to supply ESCOM and a new liquefication parastatal to reduce oil import.\nAs Euro-American cartels controlled global oil, American oil imports surpassed exports. To stabilize oil supply, America\u2019s State Department negotiated fair profit for Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and UST allowed oil royalty tax-write offs. Emphasizing financial stability, Congress expanded FDIC\u2019s receivership authority with the  (\u201cDA1950\u201d). \nAfter the Japanese military enslaved northern Korean coalers, tensions were inevitable in the Far East\u2019s coal hub. Inflation spread as the coal-poor capitalist South battled the coal-rich Marxist North in 1950. While Truman hired Thomas Cabot to direct the <italic>Office of International Security Affairs</italic>, GE\u2019s Charles Wilson and <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Weinberg to mobilize, and <italic>Sullivan</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Arthur Dean to negotiate on behalf of the <italic>United Nations</italic>. \nAs FRS continued to peg UST bond rates, their bond purchases with <italic>dollars</italic> soared as UST funded the <italic>Korean War</italic> with additional debt, leading <italic>dollar</italic> inflation to surge. So, FRS <italic>New York</italic> brought together representatives from the commercial bank, securities, and LIC associations. They stressed voluntary cooperation among major lenders was to prevent borrowers from seeking multiple loans, leveraging the <italic>Defense Production Act</italic> to suspend antitrust laws as necessary. \nThe guiding committee comprised four members, including FRS Governor Oliver Powell, <italic>Morgan </italic>NB Chair George Whitney, <italic>Chase</italic> SVP George Champion, and <italic>Citi</italic> President George Moore, who met every other week to establish guidelines and review appeals from borrowers labeled inflationary. The first bulletin emphasized the importance of lending rates not exceeding production growth. Among other projects, <italic>Citi</italic> rejected Arizona ranch investments for Andr\u00e9 Meyer of <italic>Lazard </italic>as inflationary.\nIn September 1950, FRS raised the discount rate, prompting UST\u2019s retaliation with a one-year financing announcement based on the old rate. FRS purchased the new UST issue, maintained the higher rate, and resold it slightly higher, sparking a six-month conflict between UST Secretary John Snyder and FRS Chair Thomas McCabe over government securities prices. President Truman intervened, recommending firm prices. \nBy March 1951, UST and FRS reached the<italic> Accord of 1951</italic>, outlining a general agreement on debt management and monetary policies to achieve the government\u2019s financial success while minimizing public debt monetization to assure FRS independence. As McCabe and Eccles resigned, satisfied that FRS had maintained its integrity amidst political pressure. While they returned to private enterprise, new FRS Chair William Martin hiked required reserve to curtail MMIBD. Investment grew as Snyder\u2019s TA1951 lowered capital gain taxes and New York\u2019s insurance regulator allowed LICs to buy stocks banned since 1905. \nWhile <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris Americanized Germano-British <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> and other African mines into <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> after WWI, they failed with Belgo-British Congolese mines. Since <italic>Bretton Woods</italic> replaced the gold standard with the American-dominated IMF after WWII, France protected her African colonies from devaluation. After issuing notes with a fixed exchange rate to the <italic>dollar</italic>, <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> devalued the notes in half in the <italic>Panic of 1948</italic>. \nFollowing the currency devaluations of European currencies in 1949, bankers met to accelerate American investments in the British colonies and, two months later, for the French Union. The latter conference comprised of <italic>Chase</italic> NB, <italic>Guaranty </italic>NB, <italic>Citi</italic> NB, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and <italic>Dillon</italic> on the American side and <italic>Indochine</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Union Europ\u00e9enne Industrielle</italic>, <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, and <italic>Worms </italic>for the French side. \nWith President Truman\u2019s support, the bankers sought to secure resources for Europe against the spread nationalization and Marxism by developing inter-national roads, railroads, and other infrastructure in South Africa, Rhodesia, and neighboring countries, prioritizing resource extraction over the native well-being. <italic>Lazard </italic>New York\u2019s Murnane helped <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> gain control of the Congo\u2019s uranium with <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>AMAX</italic>, and <italic>Rockefeller</italic> in 1950, along with Mozambique railroads for export. \nConcurrently, Oppenheimer and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Randal Vivian Smyth led <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>, which transferred equity to <italic>American Anglo-Transvaal Investment Corp</italic>, included <italic>Ladenberg Thalmann</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Rockefeller</italic>, and <italic>Kennecott</italic>. France soon depended on her Gabon and Madagascar colonies for uranium. While a Baring joined <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> in London in 1951, the son of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Lord Smyth\u2014husband of Katz-descendant Helen Primrose, granddaughter of Hannah Rothschild\u2014joined in Johannesburg.\nAt AEC, America\u2019s main uranium buyer, meanwhile, former <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Lewis Strauss-Darmstadt was often at odds with Lilienthal. The former persuaded the Pentagon to set up radiation detection stations, which picked up the first Soviet atomic explosion in 1949, a few days before Moscow made its official announcement. Likewise, as he sought to develop a hydrogen bomb, unlike Robert Oppenheimer. \nBy 1950, Morrow left AEC to join <italic>Rockefeller</italic> as a financial advisor. Also in 1950, Lilienthal left AEC to join Andr\u00e9 Meyer at <italic>Lazard</italic>. Together, they sought to restructure mining for post-WWII. Since former <italic>Dillon </italic>banker Ferdinand Eberstadt was a UN <italic>Atomic Energy Commission </italic>delegate, he partnered with Meyer, who invested in and merged <italic>Minerals Separation </italic>and <italic>Attapulgus Clay</italic> in 1952 and installed Lilienthal as president of the new <italic>MINERAL</italic>. \nSo, Strauss-Darmstadt became AEC Chair.<italic> </italic>Since Brigadier General William Draper Jr returned to <italic>Dillon</italic> in 1949, Truman named him Ambassador to NATO in 1952. Since serving as Marshall\u2019s Under Secretary of State, Robert Lovett returned to <italic>Brown Harriman </italic>until General Marshall became Secretary of Defense in 1950. Marshall appointed Lovett as Under Secretary of Defense, and later, he assumed the role of Secretary of Defense himself from 1951 to 1953.\nSince only Russia had the bauxite, coal, and hydro-electricity necessary for aluminum production within Europe, and AA1914 prohibited prevented industrial mergers, <italic>ALUM</italic> dominated free-world aluminum extra-territorially out of the Caribbean. Since FDR packed the Court with \u2018trustbusters\u2019, DOJ failed to dissolve <italic>ALUM</italic> as justices recused themselves. <italic>ALUM</italic> assured Allied victory in WWII, but FDR privatized wartime Caribbean aluminum for competition. So, <italic>ALUM</italic> won against DOJ in 1951. \nDuring WWII, the Allies deposed Persia\u2019s Pro-German Shah, who died in 1944. Amidst the currency devaluation and price controls after the <italic>Panic 1948</italic>, <italic>Anglo-</italic><italic>Iranian</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>William Fraser sought to ramp up production. As Iran\u2019s newly appointed PM Mohammad Mossadeq, redistributed feudal lands and nationalized oil, global energy inflated after America led a boycott. Having refocused to oil in Kuwait and elsewhere in the Middle Eastern, <italic>Imperial</italic><italic> Bank of Persia</italic><italic> </italic>changed her name to <italic>British Bank of the Middle East </italic>(\u201cBBME\u201d), and withdraw from Iran amidst escalating tensions between the government and <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic><italic> </italic>over oil\u00a0by 1952. While IMF\u2019s Camille Gutt advised Mossadeq on reorganizing the economy, <italic>Narodny</italic> Tehran remained as the sole foreign bank active in Iran, shifting to full Soviet ownership in 1954.\nHaving employed economic reprisal against nationalists and Marxists, America used force in Iran and then South America. In 1953, Kermit Roosevelt\u2014Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s grandson and CIA\u2019s chief operative in the Middle East\u2014and<italic> Sullivan</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Allen Dulles representing <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic>, orchestrated a CIA coup to depose Mossadeq<italic> </italic>and installed the former Shah\u2019s son as they reinstated the institution. With the renegotiation of<italic> Anglo-Iranian</italic>\u2019s oil concession, <italic>Sullivan </italic>helped redivision the British concession to include American oil companies. As <italic>Anglo-Iranian </italic>became <italic>British Petroleum </italic>in 1955, William Fraser became a baron and retired. By then <italic>Shell</italic> had mostly Americanized and Alex Fraser had retired. \nWhile Mossadeq had<italic> </italic>dismissed Abol Ebtehaj as Governor of <italic>Bank</italic> <italic>Melli </italic>in 1950, Ebtehaj became an IMF advisor in 1953 and returned to Iran the following year. Since promoting <italic>Persian</italic><italic> Plan Organization</italic>, from <italic>Melli</italic>, he chaired the development organization and invested in rail links to Tabriz and Mashhad and dam works on the Karaj, Sefid Rud, and Dez rivers. Drawing on TVA\u2019s model, he involved David Lilienthal arranged <italic>BANK</italic> support for foreign engineers.\nSince FX shortages in 1948 led Norway, Europe\u2019s largest independent oil tanker fleet, to ban ship imports, Aristotle Onassis sensed opportunity. In 1906, Aristotle Onassis was born in Smyrna to a prosperous Greek merchant family. Despite living under Ottoman rule, the Anatolian Greeks were relatively autonomous. Aristotle\u2019s father Socrates began trading cotton, hides, tobacco, opium, figs, raisins, barley, olive oil, and carpets. The introduction of railroads further boosted their export opportunities from the Anatolian interior and Socrates became chairman of the local bank and hospital. After WWI, Aristotle fled to Argentina, and pledging his father\u2019s bills of lading as security to borrow from <italic>Citi</italic> Buenos Aires branch to manufacture cigarettes for women. After moving to America, Aristotle continued to bank with <italic>Citi</italic>.\nAround 1950, Walter Wriston became his banker. The grandson of an Episcopal minister and son of the President of<italic> Brown Uni</italic>, Wriston joined <italic>Citi</italic> in 1946 after graduating <italic>Wesleyan</italic> and the <italic>Fletcher School</italic> and serving at the State Department during WWII. Marrying the daughter of a marine law specialist, Wriston was uniquely qualified as seafaring oil tankers became the primary source of profitability when the post-war era witnessed an oil surplus outpacing the available tanker capacity. When Onassis bought tankers from <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic> for $1.5 million each in 1950, <italic>Metropolitan</italic> LIC, <italic>Citi</italic>, and <italic>Chase</italic> held substantial portions of these loans.\nAmerica also sold ships to Stratis Andreadis. From a Chiot ship owning family, Andreadis married a daughter of Alexandros Koryzis, Governor of <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>and briefly PM, in 1941. By 1952, he acquired control of <italic>Commercial Bank of Greece</italic> and served as VP, and later President, of <italic>Union of Greek Shipowners</italic>.\nUnder price caps since January 1951, oil shortages spread in America, and <italic>LABOR</italic>\u2019s coal miners struck in October 1952, shutting down 95% of American bituminous production. Instead of accommodating production, TRC lobbied to block oil imports in early 1953, before oil price caps were removed in February. Amidst the energy inflation, antitrust law led American anthracite exporters to form an AA1918 cartel and Germany. \nSince helped reestablish <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne, Robert Pferdmenges, acting for an informal Ruhr industry directorate, proposed ceding 50% of the Ruhr iron and steel industry to French interests through <italic>Wendel</italic>, in late 1947. Moreover, he co-founded the <italic>Christian Democrat Union </italic>party, through which he was elected into the <italic>Bundestag</italic> in 1949. However, the French declined negotiations but agreed on a Franco-German settlement. In response, Jean Monnet\u2019s planning team drafted a supranational coal and steel authority.\nMonnet also had strong connections with America since his former partner, George Murnane, joined <italic>Lazard</italic> New York. Likewise, Monnet was closed to America and Britain. In 1929, Monnet, representing <italic>Blair</italic>, worked with John McCloy of <italic>Cravath</italic> on Milan\u2019s municipal bond issue. Monnet met Sylvia, then married to <italic>Blair</italic> Milan representative, and later married her. In the early 1930s, McCloy assisted Monnet in a failed <italic>Transamerica</italic> takeover. By then, McCloy married Ellen Zinsser, whose cousin married Joyce Knowlton. Joyce\u2019s brother, Hugh, worked at <italic>International Acceptance Bank </italic>and became a <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner in 1933 and married the sister of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Harold Stanley. \nDuring WWII, McCloy became Assistant Secretary of War and coordinated with Monnet on supply logistics. While McCloy\u2019s brother-in-law Lewis Douglas became Ambassador to Britain after WWII, McLoy secured Congressional approval for the <italic>Lend-Lease Act</italic>, he served as President of <italic>BANK</italic>\u2019s <italic>International Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> from 1947, High Commissioner for Germany from 1949. McCloy became a Partner at <italic>Milbank</italic> <italic>Tweed</italic> <italic>Hope</italic> <italic>Hadley</italic> <italic>McCloy</italic>, the law firm for the Rockefeller family and <italic>Chase</italic> NB. While he was High Commissioner, McCloy also worked with Lehman-in-law Benjamin Buttenwieser, who left <italic>Kuhn</italic> to assist in 1947. Likewise, Hugh Knowlton\u2019s daughter married the first cousin once removed of John Morgan\u2019s Satterlee son-in-law in 1949.\nIn May 1950, Monnet\u2019s plan, announced as the Schuman Plan, led to the <italic>European Coal & Steel Community</italic> (\u201cECSC\u201d) supra-national cartel and customs union among France, Italy, Belgium, and the Dutch in April 1951, ending Allied control of the Ruhr and restoring private ownership while institutionalizing European heavy industry coordination. The 1951 <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> established ECSC aimed to promote economic integration and prevent war in Europe, introducing antitrust and merger control competition rules for a fair playing field in the European steel  industry. Monnet chaired ECSC until <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 Rene Mayer replaced him in 1955. \nWhile drifting away from banking, Pferdmenges served as economic adviser to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and helped prevent the dismantling of German industries. Likewise, <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Hermann Abs served as Chancellor Adenauer\u2019s economic advisor, joined the Cabinet Committee for Economic Affairs in 1951, and negotiated German pre-war debts in London. \nSince the Americans decentralized German public banks in 1947, the regional branches of <italic>Deutsche</italic> were allowed to consolidate into three regional banks in D\u00fcsseldorf, Hamburg, and Munich in 1952. Similarly, <italic>Dresdner</italic> and <italic>Commerzbank</italic> were restructured, with the later amalgamating into <italic>Commerzbank</italic> <italic>Bankverein</italic>, <italic>Commerzund Credit-Bank</italic>, and <italic>Commerzund Discontobank</italic>. Despite the gradual return to stability, Chancellor Adenauer assured that the banks would not further amalgamate for at least three years. \nTo rescue German industry in 1952, Abs reorganized <italic>Farben</italic> into nine firms\u2014including the large BASF,<italic> Bayer</italic>, and <italic>Hoechst</italic>\u2014<italic>Deutsche</italic> represented the first two, and <italic>Dresdner</italic> the latter per American desire to maintain separateness. As Pferdmenges facilitated the rescue of <italic>Thyssen-H\u00fctte</italic> in 1953, <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, which expanded from Cologne and bought a Frankfurt bank in 1951, saw a Goldschmidt <italic>Oppenheim</italic> heiress marry a grandson and son of former <italic>Hungarian</italic> <italic>Creditbank</italic> presidents Adolf and Georg Ulman.\nBorn into a Protestant textile dynasty like Pferdmenges, Herbert Quandt\u2014the stepson of Chief Nazi propogandist Joseph Goebbels\u2014rescued BMW in 1954. The following year, Quandt and insurer <italic>Gerling</italic> funded <italic>Herstatt. </italic>Since his grandfather\u2019s death led <italic>Stein</italic> relatives to take over <italic>Herstatt</italic> in 1888, Iwan Herstatt began his career in 1931 at <italic>Deutsche </italic>and worked for <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Alsace & Lorraine</italic> during WWII. \nIn 1950, he joined <italic>Bank f\u00fcr Gemeinwirtschaft</italic> in Cologne and grew her operations. In 1955, Herstatt resigned and acquired a Cologne bank to start <italic>Herstatt</italic>. As <italic>Herstatt</italic> issued bonds, <italic>Gerling</italic>\u2019s network of insurers and mortgage banks bought them, allowing <italic>Herstatt</italic> to surpass <italic>Oppenheim</italic> as Germany\u2019s largest private bank within several decades. However, as decartelization ended, Germany large public banks <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, and <italic>Dresdner</italic> had fully re-amalgamated by 1957. \nSince Jean Monnet organized supply operations for the Free French Forces in America during the war, he was assisted by Christian Valensi\u2014a cousin-in-law of the Lazard, Gunzburg, and Lumbroso families\u2014in negotiating post-war credits and managing <italic>Marshall</italic> <italic>Plan</italic> logistics in France by 1948. In 1949, Pierre Weill and Andr\u00e9 Meyer reopened <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, rehiring pre-war partners, and adding Valensi. By 1950, <italic>Lazard</italic> London arranged wool credits with ECGD guarantees. \nWhile <italic>Sassoon</italic>\u2019s Elias Sassoon negotiated and advising on diplomatic relations with Turkey and Egypt, the <italic>Korean War</italic> inflated Egyptian cotton. But when peace deflated prices, Egyptian riots started in 1952. King Farouk, a descendant of Pasha Muhammad Ali Pasha, struggled internally with the Wafd party and externally with British control. By 1952, the Free Officers\u2019 movement co-led by Marxist military officer Gamal Nasser forced the King to abdicate and abolished the monarchy. Although <italic>Sassoon</italic> and <italic>Cattaui</italic> created <italic>Bank of Cairo</italic>, Nasser\u2019s military coup seized power and arrested imprisoned Jewish Marxists associated with Herni Curiel to favor nationalism over democratic socialism. \nLikewise, Dutch textile firm <italic>TenCate</italic> merged with competitors amidst the crisis, <italic>Twentsche Bank</italic> played a role in consolidating the often family-run industry. And in America, textile surplus grew since the <italic>Panic of 1948</italic>, leading manufacturers to relocate from New England to the union-free South. When <italic>Textron</italic>\u2019s Royal Little sought to close <italic>Nashua Mills</italic>, he faced anti-labor criticism with <italic>Textile Workers Union</italic> President Emil Rieve labeling him a \u2018blight upon Nashua\u2019 and Senator Charles Tobey accusing him of \u2018tax dodges.\u2019 <italic>Textron</italic>\u2019s sales collapsed, resulting in a large deficit. \nLittle emerged from the downturn damaged and doubts grew about <italic>Textron</italic>\u2019s ability to maintain its presence in old markets, let alone expand into new ones as hopes of using stock for acquisitions faded with a depressed stack valuation. Little decided that <italic>Textron</italic> would continue seeking merger opportunities, but not exclusively in textiles to diversify <italic>Textron</italic> as a conglomerate. Over antitrust concerns, TA1954 precipitated tax-loss fueled consolidation as textiles merged to combine NOCs. To compete with cheap Southern electricity, two New England textiles merged into <italic>Berkshire Hathaway</italic> (\u201c<italic>Berkshire</italic>\u201d). \nEarlier, to build confidence in <italic>Bretton Woods</italic>\u2019 <italic>dollar</italic>, BOE allowed <italic>Rothschild</italic> to renew the <italic>London Gold Pool</italic> for South African gold from 1914, at $35 per ounce. While Switzerland stayed on gold standard until 1936 and did not outlaw gold ownership, she required dealer licenses and set maximum price controls on gold. Having lifted price controls in 1951 and licensing requirements in 1952, the Swiss government eliminated gold sales taxes in 1954. So,<italic> Safra</italic> branched to Geneva to bank for gold and FX his family\u2019s former clients globally. \nWhile Beirut grew into a major gold center, she faced stiff competition. Since <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> (a Cohen-Barent-cousin) wed a Goldsmid of <italic>Goldsmid Mocatta</italic> in 1898, <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu </italic>joined<italic> Rothschild London\u2019s London Gold Pool </italic>to finance WWI. Since gold traders re-opened in Hong Kong, <italic>Samuel Montagu</italic> dominated that market along with two other traders. And on behalf of <italic>Bank of Nova Scotia</italic>, <italic>Samuel Montagu </italic>issued gold certificates in London from 1954 and <italic>Deutsche</italic> did so out of Frankfurt.\nAmidst the cotton crisis, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris used ECGD guarantees and capital from <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Marshall </italic>to form a cotton cartel and stabilize prices. By 1954, <italic>Lazard </italic>New York\u2019s Murnane, arranged ECSC\u2019s first loan along with <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>, distributed with <italic>Chase</italic>, and <italic>Warburg </italic>London. As Monnet recommended Guyot as a tax inspector, Meyer hired him to lead <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris.\nLike with <italic>Pictet</italic>, <italic>Sarasin</italic>, <italic>Hentsch</italic>, and other Swiss family-owned private banks, the founding families remained on <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s board for generations since the 1860s. <italic>Sarasin</italic> also maintained her pre-WWII connections with <italic>Brown</italic> in New York, where Alfred Sarasin trained in 1948 like his father had in the 1920s. Such family bonds continued to link <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>, and Swiss bankers. Since marrying a descendant of John Morgan\u2019s Sturges brother-in-law in 1939, Charles Munson joined the Executive Committee of <italic>Guaranty</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Guaranty </italic>custodied shares of <italic>American European Securities </italic>PUIHC (\u201cAESC\u201d), <italic>Guaranty </italic>VP and officer in charge of custody, EL Brickhouse, served as AESC\u2019s Secretary and Treasurer. In 1953, Munson\u2019s son became a director of AESC, and in 1959, he was named president. A year earlier, in 1952, a daughter of AESC\u2019s former President Ernest Tracy married an American Iselin, whose family had long represented <italic>Pictet</italic>, <italic>Lombard</italic>, <italic>Hentch</italic>, and other Swiss interests.\nAs Truman reimposed wage and price controls, he forced inflationary steel wage hikes with illegal seizures. Amidst the inflation, Congress repealed presidential credit control authority, Truman decontrolled oil, and FRS restricted monetary policy. After shocking markets with higher yielding bonds in March, UST elongated maturity in May, tightening MMUST. While FRS reduced reserve requirements, MMIBD deflated as creditor banks ran to higher-yielding UST debt. Although FRS and banks resumed MMFR, tight credit spurred securities firms to borrow from nonfinancial businesses using UST security repos. With her<italic> </italic>futures disrupted, <italic>Fannie Mae </italic>sold mortgage insurance to builders as a lender of last resort. As the <italic>Panic of 1953</italic> developed, post-WWII legislation overhauled federal business and society policy in ways that played out for decades. \nFor energy security, Congress promoted the development of nuclear-powered federal PUHCs after 1954 by capping tort liabilities. And for European stability, Saudi Arabia organized a state oil-tanker with Onassis in 1954. As the value of ship loans across American financial institutions surged from $250 million to $1.25 billion between 1950 and 1956, oil volumes grew 900% from 1954 to 1972, nearly 60% of the global trade, with Onassis and his countryman Niarchos making Greece have the largest national fleet. By then, American bankers funded Daniel Ludwig\u2019s shipping empire. He began by engaging his father\u2019s ships for rumrunning during Prohibition. \nFrom 1936, Ludwig expanded his operations with a loan from <italic>Chemical </italic>NB, which he used to buy and convert decommissioned freight vessels into tankers. He pioneered a financing method later adopted by Greek rivals, using long-term charters secured major oil companies as bank loan collateral to fully cover the cost of tanker construction. As he competed with Greek shipping magnates in the postwar tanker industry, he enlisted low-wage labor from the West Indies for his crews. His empire further expanded by renting shipyards in Japan in the 1950s, and it extended into various industries, including oil, real estate, banking, shipbuilding, steel, cattle, and mining, with holdings in America, South America, Japan, and the Caribbean. \nThe Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in Europe during WWII, General Dwight Eisenhower became President in 1953. While Dwight had pursued military endeavors, his brother Arthur joined <italic>Commerce Trust Co</italic> in 1905 and became EVP and director in 1934. He served as chief loan officer for seven years before being named Vice Chair in 1956, during which time he gained acclaim in flour and grain financing. \nArthur Eisenhower also held positions as President of <italic>Plaza Bank of Commerce</italic> and director of <italic>Trans World Airlines</italic>, <italic>Interstate Securities Co</italic>, and <italic>Coleman Co</italic> of Wichita.<italic> </italic><italic>Commerce Trust Co</italic>, <italic>Plaza Bank</italic>, and several other banks were founded at the turn of the century by William  Kemper, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, who multiplied his wealth following oil discoveries in the 1920s and led the Democratic National Committee until his death in 1938. Kemper\u2019s descendants continued to lead the banks, <italic>Kansas City Structural Steel</italic>, <italic>Stewart Sand & Material Co</italic>, and <italic>Holland-American Insurance Co</italic>.\nHowever, President Eisenhower owed his political ascent to support from the Dulles brothers, Douglas Dillon, <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Weinberg, and <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s Aldrich. While John Dulles became Secretary of State; while his brother Allen became CIA Director after helping form it. Eisenhower appointed CIA co-founder Dillon as Ambassador to France. While Aldrich retired from <italic>Chase</italic> and became Ambassador to Britain, Democrat Weinberg remained at <italic>Goldman</italic>, but enjoyed great influence. Allen also helped form the <italic>National Committee for Free Europe</italic>, with support from <italic>Sullivan </italic>clients. Dulles served as the committee\u2019s Chair, while his financial adviser and <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic> member, Frank Altschul of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York, was treasurer. \nAdditionally, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand was involved with the <italic>Council</italic>\u2019s British study group, which focused on the spread of Marxism in Asia. At Dulles\u2019 behest, Eisenhower appointed<italic> </italic>Dean to lead post-armistice talks with North Korea and China. Eisenhower appointed <italic>Morgan </italic>NB\u2019s Henry Alexander to head his Korean relief drive in 1952. Within a year, Eisenhower appointed Thomas Gates as Under Secretary of the Navy. The son of a <italic>Morgan </italic>partner in the 1920s who left to lead <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic>, Thomas Gates was a <italic>Drexel</italic> partner before and after WWII. By 1957, Gates rose to Secretary of the Navy and then Secretary of the Defense.\nFor UST Secretary in 1953, Eisenhower appointed George Humphrey. Since his brother had married banker Benjamin Strong\u2019s daughter in 1924, Humphrey fused <italic>COALH</italic> with Frank Love\u2019s <italic>Union Collieries</italic> and <italic>COALH</italic>\u2019s iron ores and West Virginia\u2019s <italic>Weirton Steel</italic>, and Detroit\u2019s <italic>Great Lakes Steel</italic> into <italic>National Steel</italic>. By 1939, his daughter married a Hanna. To assist Humphrey, Eisenhower appointed Randolph Burgess, who led FRS <italic>New York</italic> before becoming Chair of <italic>Citi</italic>. Severing his ties to the bank, Humphrey married fellow widower Helen Hamilton, a second great-granddaughter of Alex Hamilton and a niece of John Morgan.\nBy 1952, an internal DOJ memo disclosed that the world\u2019s seven largest oil companies had violated antitrust laws by colluding to divide markets, fix prices, and control global oil production. In 1953, DOJ suggested dropping criminal charges for a civil suit if the oil majors furnished the evidence during Truman\u2019s outgoing administration. Calling this offer \u2018<italic>outrageous Blackmail</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>, <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Dean refused to negotiate with DOJ as he represented the oil majors during the Eisenhower Administration. (He was also <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s Chief Counsel.)\nAs the Court rejected DOJ\u2019s 1947 securities broker cartel case in 1953, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley </italic>banked GE and <italic>Kuhn</italic> advised <italic>Westinghouse</italic>, <italic>Kennecott</italic>, and <italic>PENN</italic> into the 1980s. Likewise, oil, banking, and industrial directors widely interlocked, including from New York to Chicago. Linked to <italic>OIL of Indiana</italic> since the 1920s, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic>\u2019s board included Robert\u202fWilson of <italic>OIL of Indiana</italic> and Robert\u202fWood of <italic>Sears</italic> sat alongside President Homer\u202fLivingston in 1953, who held directorships at <italic>Armour</italic>, <italic>Inland Steel</italic>, and <italic>OIL of Indiana</italic>. \nIn 1954 James\u202fOates, then a <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic> director and head of several Chicago corporations, became President and Chair of <italic>Equitable </italic>LIC the board of <italic>Chase</italic> NB, forging a three-way interlock among <italic>Equitable</italic>, <italic>Chase</italic>, and Chicago interests. By 1960, half of <italic>Equitable</italic>\u2019s directors sat on other bank boards, including four at <italic>Chase</italic> and three at <italic>Chemical</italic> NB, whose Chair always a <italic>Chase</italic> director, and <italic>Chase</italic> president David Rockefeller on <italic>Equitable</italic>\u2019s board. By 1961, Monroe\u202fRathbone of <italic>OIL of New Jersey</italic> joined <italic>Morgan </italic>NB\u2019s board, complementing Eugene Holman\u2019s service on the <italic>Chase</italic> board and Leo\u202fWelch\u2019s on <italic>Citi</italic> NB\u2019s board. \nBanks without interlocking directors, faced greater antitrust risk. While FRS forced <italic>TransAmerica</italic> to sell <italic>Bank of America</italic> under AA1914, bank regulators controlled intra-state bank mergers, and so FRS could not force <italic>TransAmerica</italic> to fully divest banks. So,  required regulators to assess bank mergers for soundness and competition, banned multi-bank BHC nonbank activities, and allowed states to regulate inter-state mergers, which most forbade. By 1958, <italic>TransAmerica</italic> spun off <italic>FirstAmerica</italic>, becoming a LIC. Although one-bank BHCs could engage in nonbank activities, there were few. Combined with DA1950, BHCA1956 enabled FDIC to merge failing banks instead of paying depositors. \nMeanwhile, Congress overhauled the tax code with . TA1954 spurred equipment tax shelters by accelerating depreciation and extending leasing from real estate to equipment. Instead of banks and stock financing, leases allowed for CP-financed rented capital. Rather than discount loans to employees UST\u2019s IRS extended stock plan tax exemptions from TA1921 to <italic>Employee Stock Ownership Plans</italic> (\u201cESOPs\u201d). Entry barriers were key to IBM\u2019s computing monopoly, which sold <italic>service, </italic>not<italic> machines</italic>. While IBM only leased computers until 1956, DOJ forced her to sell to processor lessors. Like TA1954, Pennsylvania regulators accelerated PU depreciation, but few other states did. \nTA1954\u2019s tax shelters stimulated mining. Since LA1889 ceased sales and LA1920 regulated leases by market power, the Federal government leased coal and uranium lands. From 1954, Congress also began Continental shelf federal land leases for oil and gas. After <italic>MINERAL</italic> bought <italic>Edger</italic> in 1954, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York took her public a year later. Since <italic>New Deal</italic> regulations, gas and oil did not compete with labor union mined coal for electricity or railroads. But this changed as more heaters and cars switched to cheap oil from the 1950s. \nOf the oil magnates, <italic>Getty </italic>was wealthier than<italic> Hunt </italic>but had less control over his company. To liberalize gas for <italic>Hunt</italic> and others, Texas Senator Lyndon Johnson prevented Olds\u2019 reappointment by branding him a Marxist. But Truman vetoed his gas deregulation bill. As New York\u2019s PU lobbied FPC to deregulate gas, the Court require FPC to regulate gas from 1954. So, gas pipes like <italic>El Paso Corp</italic> bought assets around shortages within the law.\nSince 1810, French mining legislation governing coal and petroleum exploration and exploitation has been complex and inadequate, with a complicated system of permits, renewals, and royalties. Without nationalization after WWII, the government controlled the sector. Following <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s discovery of Parentis, Western Europe\u2019s largest oil and gas fields in France, and others in Africa by 1954, new decrees in 1955 have simplified the system, giving holders of exploration permits the right to choose the area they want to retain at each renewal period and modifying the length and renewal terms of search permits. Along with international oil majors, French companies formed joint ventures. \nThe first wave of investment focused domestically. After the discovery of the Parentis field in 1954 and the liberalization of petroleum regulations, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Shell</italic>, and <italic>OIL</italic> founded FINAREP to finance oil exploration. In 1955, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Worms</italic>, and <italic>Comptoir</italic> created COFIREP as a rival venture. Since brothers Pierre and Raymond Meynial joined <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Paris</italic> and <italic>Worms</italic> before WWII, Raymond rose to Managing Partner of <italic>Worms</italic> by 1949 and his relative married Octave Homberg\u2019s granddaughter, while Pierre\u2019s became VP and Managing Director of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Guaranty</italic> Paris in 1958.\nInvesting together in <italic>Monnet Murnane</italic> in the 1930s, Andr\u00e9 Meyer invested in <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Indochine</italic> from 1945 and increasingly through 1955 to align with <italic>Rothschild</italic> and Monnet. Along with directing <italic>Nord</italic>, <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic>, and <italic>Co Europ\u00e9enne des C\u00e9r\u00e9ales</italic> during this period, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 Georges Pompidou sat on the boards of <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic>, <italic>Co Africaine d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Entreprises Maritimes</italic>, and Saharan oil projects. \nAt this time, Andr\u00e9 Meyer became acquainted with <italic>Philipp</italic>. Excluded from steel and other commodities before WWII, Jews like <italic>Luria</italic> dominated second-hand scrap. Since <italic>COPPER</italic> cofounder <italic>Lewisohn</italic> cousin Minna Philipp married a Katz descendant, her brother Joseph apprenticed with <italic>Hirsch</italic>\u2019s metal refinery, and married a direct descendant of Samson Wertheim and Joseph Goldschmidt. After Joseph opened <italic>Philipp</italic> in Hamburg, he soon branched to London around 1900, and his cousin started <italic>Philipp</italic> New York in 1914. \nWhile Joseph Philipp\u2019s nephew wed a descendant of Court Jew Michael Speyer in 1938, his son married <italic>Hirsch</italic> founder Aron Hirsch\u2019s great-granddaughter\u2019s husband\u2019s niece in 1942. Although Joseph Philipp, his wife, and other family died in the Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp, cousins fleeing Nazi Europe joined <italic>Philipp</italic>. One of them, Siegfried Ulmann (of unknown relation to the Ulman or Ullmann families), moved <italic>Philipp</italic> to Switzerland in the 1950s, where she created a spot market for metal and became the world\u2019s largest scrap metal trader. \nAlong with hiring Murnane\u2019s son, George Jr, after his dismissal from a Wall Street firm in 1955, Meyer as the investment banker for Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Chase </italic>was involved in the formation of <italic>American Overseas Finance Corp </italic>by <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston</italic>, <italic>Mellon Bank</italic>, and <italic>Chase</italic>. Also in 1955, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>First Boston</italic>, and <italic>Warburg</italic> formed <italic>Transoceanic Development</italic> in Canada to participate in <italic>BANK</italic>\u2019s <italic>International</italic> <italic>Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> (\u201cIBRD\u201d) and Britain\u2019s international development arm, <italic>Commonwealth Development Corp</italic>.\nThe same year, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Barclay</italic>, and <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> formed South Africa\u2019s first merchant bank, <italic>Union Acceptances</italic>, which dominated the money market until the 1970s. By 1956, Julian Thompson, the <italic>Oxford</italic> educated son of a former South Africa Chief Justice, worked at <italic>Rowe </italic><italic>Pitman</italic>, and married the daughter of <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Thomas Brand and joined <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>\u2019s London office.\nAfter receiving supplier credits, Latin American countries began defaulting. While reorganizing Brazil\u2019s debt, Britain, Germany, and the Dutch established the <italic>Hague Club</italic> in August 1955 to maintain payments arrangements without convertible currencies. Creditors organized the debt-reorg in the <italic>Paris Club</italic> for <italic>BANK</italic>, government, and private lenders with ECGD guarantees. \nBy July 1956, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Britain set up the <italic>Paris Club</italic> when restructuring Argentine debt. Finland, Germany, Italy, and Japan joined later. With this arrangement, countries applied the same FX treatment to the <italic>Club</italic> as exports, paid in convertible currencies, and could transfer earnings to non-<italic>dollar</italic> countries. Even after currencies became convertible, the <italic>Paris Club</italic> continued reorganizing debt. \nThe same month, <italic>BANK</italic> organized <italic>International Finance Corp</italic> (\u201cIFC\u201d) to fund private firms without public guarantees. Since the Allies dissolved GRB in 1945, Germany regained monetary policy and formed <italic>German Bundesbank</italic> (\u201cGBB\u201d) in 1957. Having been dismissed by the Nazis during WWII for his refusal to infiltrate <italic>Unilever</italic>\u2019s international operations, Karl Blessing became GBB\u2019s first President.\nAfter WWII, the global Marxist bloc gained distribution share from America and Europe. As part of her mission, <italic>BANK</italic> financed hydroelectric projects to promote economic development, reduce poverty, and build good will. When India nationalized <italic>Imperial Bank</italic><italic> </italic><italic>o</italic><italic>f India</italic> of 1921 into <italic>State Bank of India</italic> in 1955, while allowing most of the country\u2019s credit system to remain private, <italic>BANK</italic> funded new development banks, like <italic>Industrial Credit & Investment Corp of India</italic> (\u201cICICI\u201d), as a collaborative effort between with the newly independent Indian government with support from IMF and other multilateral development initiatives. \nWhile blocking TVA\u2019s growth domestically, Congress used TVA to export technology to Iran and others. After Egypt bought Soviet-Czechoslovak weapons against Israel, America and Britain sought peace by funding <italic>Aswan Dam </italic>via <italic>BANK</italic>. But as Egypt and Syria signed a defense treaty, Israel launched a preventative war against Syria. As Nasser increased his belligerence, <italic>BANK</italic> paused<italic> Aswan Dam</italic> funds by April 1956. \nNasser soon saw what he perceived as weakness. In June, a landslide damaged New York\u2019s <italic>Niagara Falls</italic> hydroelectric station, leading steel laborers to strike and Eisenhower to approve a record pay hike. While TBTA\u2019s Moses got public approval to develop the Saint-Lawrence River he sought for decades, Richberg linked labor unions to Marxism. While some countries instituted compulsory arbitration\u2014along with New York and Pennsylvania PUs\u2014Congress issued individual orders from the 1960s.\nThe same month, Golda Meir became Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Israel. While Meir rose on her individual merit, she preceded female leaders that were part of elite political dynasties, including Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Indira Nehru, and Isabel Peron. Seeing an opportunity, Nasser accused <italic>BANK </italic>of breaking her contact, and nationalized <italic>Suez</italic> <italic>Canal</italic> by October, cutting off the Tiran Straits to Israeli trade and European imports of Middle Eastern oil, starting the <italic>Panic of 1956</italic>. \nTo protect their assets and restore oil flow along <italic>Suez</italic> <italic>Canal</italic>, Europe\u2019s army to responded in the <italic>Sinai War</italic>. As Egypt fused with Syria, the Soviets financed <italic>Aswan Dam</italic> construction. Because of not aiding the British-French\u2010Israeli invasion of Egypt, America and Ambassador to Britain Winthrop Aldrich faced criticism. After Aldrich worked to salvage goodwill, he retired from diplomacy and returned to New York to reunite with Rockefeller interests in 1957. \nWith tight bank credit and growing takeovers, <italic>Ford</italic> <italic>Motor</italic> went public in 1956 in a record IPO. Since <italic>Ford</italic> and <italic>Firestone</italic> <italic>Tire</italic> heirs kinterlinked in 1946, <italic>Citi\u2019</italic>s involvement with the Ford family increased significantly following <italic>Ford</italic>\u2019s IPO. <italic>Davis Polk</italic>, the bank\u2019s law firm, and <italic>Sullivan</italic> advised <italic>Ford</italic>,<italic> </italic>while <italic>Blyth</italic> led the selling syndicate, and the bank became <italic>Ford</italic>\u2019s stock transfer agent. In 1955, the bank acquired <italic>Bank of Monrovia</italic> in Liberia, enhancing its relationship with <italic>Firestone</italic>, which had rubber plantations in the region. Both <italic>Ford</italic> and <italic>Firestone</italic> aimed to reduce their reliance on the <italic>Morgan</italic>-Rockefeller financial group. Despite these connections, <italic>Citi </italic>did not exert control over either company.\nSince <italic>Suez</italic> <italic>Canal</italic> was the main throughway of Iranian\u2014and post-1948\u2014Iraqi oil, shortages squeezed Europe in the <italic>Panic of 1956</italic>. While Europe\u2019s army responded in the <italic>Sinai War</italic>, ECSC and America raised coal caps and energy exports, and Congress forced TRC to lift quotas. As American bituminous coal exporters briefly cartelized per AA1918, the Court blocked steel mergers as law firms refused to go against DOJ. \nIndeed, <italic>Lehman</italic> dominated American oil post-WWII after making Texan Joseph Thomas joined in 1930 and made partner in 1936. Thomas later recruited fellow Texan James Glanville. Financing companies like <italic>Kerr-McGree Oil</italic> and <italic>Murphy</italic> <italic>Corp</italic> from 1946, <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s assets were primarily invested in oil, gas, and PUs by 1950. In 1957, <italic>Lehman</italic> developed oil-payment-production loans for companies like <italic>Monterey</italic>, enabling them to buy additional oil properties.\n<italic>COALH</italic>, meanwhile, diversified. Since his brother married banker Benjamin Strong\u2019s daughter in 1924, CEO George Humphrey fused <italic>COALH</italic> with Frank Love\u2019s <italic>Union Collieries</italic> and <italic>COALH</italic>\u2019s iron ores and West Virginia\u2019s <italic>Weirton Steel</italic>, and Detroit\u2019s <italic>Great Lakes Steel</italic> into <italic>National Steel</italic>. After his daughter married a Hanna in 1939, George Humphrey became UST Secretary in 1953 until his death in 1957. That year, the son of former Marcus Converse Hanna\u2019s daughter and a son of William Moore, cofounder of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> and <italic>STEEL</italic>, became Chair of <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>. \nLikewise, George Love became CEO of <italic>COALH</italic> and transformed the coal industry during the 1950s by introducing large-scale mechanization, including efficient strip shovels, which increased profitability but had negative environmental and employment consequences. <italic>COALH</italic> interlocked directors with the Mellons and <italic>ALUM</italic> since creating the country\u2019s largest coal enterprise by buying <italic>Pittsburg Coal</italic> 1945. \nAs Love served as a director of the Mellon and Hanna controlled <italic>National Steel</italic>, which provided around 40% <italic>Chrysler</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>steel supplies, he took advantage of depressed <italic>Chrysler</italic> stock prices amidst an executive scandal and bought a controlling interest in <italic>Chrysler </italic>from 1953 before joining the board in 1958, and becoming Chair in 1961. For five years form 1960, Love employed <italic>State Street</italic>\u2019s Paul Cabot to float some of the Hanna family\u2019s <italic>COALH</italic> and<italic> National Steel</italic> interests into an investment company. \nHaving worked with <italic>New York Trust</italic> and <italic>Chemical</italic> in New York, Robert Ireland\u2014a grandnephew of Mark Hanna and brother George Humphrey\u2019s daughter-in-law\u2014became a <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic> partner in 1960. Like <italic>Hunt</italic>, <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Harriman</italic> funded oil shelters. George Herbert Walker Bush (\u201cBush Sr\u201d), hailed from a banking and political family; his father was Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush, and his mother, Dorothy, was the daughter of George Herbert Walker, who had been Prescott\u2019s manager at <italic>Brown</italic>. Bush Sr began his career in the Texas oil industry in 1948 and soon formed the independent oil company <italic>Bush-Overbey</italic>. \nBush Sr then solicited one of <italic>Brown</italic>\u2019s most prominent clients, Eugene Meyer, who invested for himself and the tax benefits. Among the most active was <italic>Lazard </italic>New York, using Disque Deane\u2019s tax, Meyer\u2019s strategy, and <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s legal expertise. Since <italic>Lehman</italic> actively opposed another natural gas bill in 1956, concerned about its impact on consumer costs and profits for gas companies, President Eisenhower vetoed the bill and FPC trapped gas in the Southwest. So America and her bankers looked to Canada.\nAfter diversifying <italic>Seagram</italic> from whiskey into other spirts in the 1940s, President Samuel Bronfman invested in the Alberta oil company <italic>Royalite</italic> by 1950. After selling his interest in <italic>Gulf Oil</italic> and buying <italic>Frankfort Oil</italic>, Seagram acquired <italic>Texas Pacific Coal & Oil </italic>in 1963, subsequently merging <italic>Frankfort</italic> and <italic>Texas Pacific</italic> to form <italic>Texas Pacific Oil</italic>. By this time, <italic>Loeb</italic> became a major securities financier. After Carl Loeb married Adeline Moses and took over <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> America during WWI to form <italic>AMAX</italic>, his son married a Lehman in the 1920s, gaining in-laws at <italic>Kuhn</italic> and other banks. Carl sold his interests at the height of 1929 to start <italic>Loeb</italic>. Before Carl\u2019s sons took over after he died in 1955, his daughter married Samuel<italic> </italic>Bronfman\u2019s son in 1953. \nThe same year, Samuel Bronfman\u2019s daughter of married Katz-descendant Alain Gunzburg, who had graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> who inherited management of <italic>Louis-Hirsch</italic><italic> </italic>in Paris. By 1957, Samuel Bronfman stepped aside, and his son Charles became <italic>Seagram</italic> President, marrying the granddaughter of former <italic>Speyer</italic> and<italic> Lazard</italic> New York partner Paul Baerwald by 1962. Bronfman was then appointed to <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic>\u2019s board. \nMoreover, Samuel Bronfman also helped Meyer develop a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. The Vienna-born Katz-descendant and grandson of a Vienna banker, Felix Rohatyn fled to France with his mother on false papers, where his stepfather met Katz-descendant Andr\u00e9 Meyer. But as free France fell Felix traveled to Oran, Casablanca, Lisbon, and Rio de Janeiro before arriving in New York at fourteen in 1942. \nAfter graduating <italic>Middlebury College</italic> in 1949, Rohatyn took a job at <italic>Lazard</italic> New York per his stepfather\u2019s connection. Content as a FX specialist initially, Rohatyn shifted to mergers and corporate finance after <italic>Seagram</italic> President Samuel Bronfman advised him that was the only way to impress Meyer. Despite Meyer\u2019s initial skepticism, Rohatyn committed to business school at night, taking a one-third salary cut. He became Meyer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, handling major deals in mergers and corporate finance.\nLikewise, <italic>Lehman</italic> hired rabbinical descendants. Eli Blachowitz \u201cBlack\u201d born in Lublin, Poland, came from a long line of rabbis. His father was the first in the family to leave post-WWI Poland to New York in 1920s. Black graduated from <italic>Yeshiva Uni</italic> in 1940 and became a rabbi in Long Island. Discontent with his role, he transitioned into business, joining <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1946 and later <italic>American Securities Corp</italic>. In 1954, he became Chair and CEO of <italic>American Seal-Kap</italic>.\nHigh energy prices also incentivized <italic>Rockefeller-</italic>, <italic>Stone Webster-,</italic> and Boston Brahmin-affiliated <italic>White Weld</italic> and Montreal\u2019s <italic>Nesbitt</italic>, which<italic> </italic>controlled <italic>Canadian Power</italic>, and banked <italic>British Columbia Power</italic>, <italic>Canada Steamships Lines</italic>, <italic>Canadian Celanese</italic>, <italic>Bathurst Power & Paper</italic>, and <italic>Canadian Oil </italic>by 1940. In 1957, <italic>Nesbitt</italic> issued debt for <italic>Trans-Canada Pipelines</italic> to pipe natural gas from Alberta to Montreal. <italic>Nesbitt</italic> coordinated with New York investment bank <italic>White Weld</italic>, advising a deal with <italic>Tennessee Gas Transmission</italic> and her subsidiary <italic>Midwestern Gas Transmission</italic>. <italic>White Weld</italic> also organized LIC financing while <italic>Lehman</italic> led another group with an option to buy Quebec\u2019s gas assets. Through years of regulatory uncertainty until FTC and Canadian regulators approved gas exports to America by 1960, <italic>Nesbitt </italic>continued floating issues and senior partners soon joined <italic>Trans-Canada</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>board.\nAmidst dumping allegations, Japan textiles cartelized in 1957. Also that year, the <italic>Treaty of Rome</italic> replaced ECSC with the <italic>European Economic Community</italic> (\u201cEEC\u201d) to reducing barriers to trade and increasing competition. At the same time, created <italic>Euratom</italic> for a single market for nuclear materials and technology. The new regime allowed the three regional <italic>Deutsche</italic> banks to re-merge into <italic>Deutsche</italic>, with Abs at the helm. \nBut as Europe grew closer, her colonies broke apart. While Indonesia nationalized <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s oil, the Soviets aided Egypt, bauxite-rich Ghana, and others following the <italic>Sinai War</italic> and recession. After Ghana supported democracy, Congress and Israel financed her. So, Eisenhower promoted Dillon under the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs to unify foreign aid policies and to re-negotiate the <italic>General Agreement on Tariffs & Trade</italic> (\u201cGATT\u201d). Moreover, Congress promoted North American trade with import quotas on overseas oil, subsidizing independent refiners at the cost of integrated majors in 1959. As America paid above market prices, Saudi Arabia cartelized producers into <italic>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</italic> (\u201cOPEC\u201d). \nWith the decline of the British Empire and rationalization of British companies, <italic>Mercantile Bank</italic> and <italic>British Bank of </italic><italic>the </italic><italic>Middle East</italic> (\u201cBBME\u201d) were insolvent. Since acquiring <italic>P&O Bank</italic> before WWII, HSBC\u2019s main rival, <italic>Chartered Bank</italic>, added the Eastern Bank and the Cyprus branches of <italic>Ionian Bank</italic> in 1957. HSBC became the largest foreign bank in many countries from the Far East to Southwest Asia as she invested in BBME and reconnected with <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> by acquiring <italic>Mercantile Bank</italic> in 1959, which had strong connections to <italic>Yule Catto</italic>. \nWhen acquiring BBME, HSBC asked Sassoon-cousin Lawrence Kadoorie to resign as a Director due to his being Jewish. As head of <italic>Chase International Ventures</italic> since 1958, Meyer co-founded <italic>Iran Development Bank</italic> with former-<italic>Chase</italic> VP and Chair of <italic>BANK</italic> Eugene Black Jr<italic>,</italic> followed by similar ventures in South Africa by 1960<italic> </italic>as <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and other American commercial banks branched overseas. \n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of the Global South</italic>\nFor centuries, Arabian society was structured into distinct clans and castes, with nobility at the apex. Camel-breeding Bedouins were considered the most elite, asserting their superiority through genealogies that traced their lineage to noble ancestors. Tribal leaders, known as sheikhs, maintained their elevated status by marrying their daughters to sheikhs of other tribes and only accepting marriages from noble families. This practice broke the customary standards of kin and tribal endogamy. The noble blood of Bedouins positioned them above other groups, such as sheep breeders, peasant farmers, and marginalized tribes like the Sulubba, Ilitaim, and Shararat, who were considered pariahs in Arabian society.\nAs some nomadic leaders settled in oases, they distanced themselves from their tribes, adopting feudal roles and leading to conflicts over tribute collection with remaining nomadic Bedouins. Rulers of the oases became emirs and sheikhs over their dependent agricultural populations. The transformation of nomadic nobility into settled power structures in Arabia unfolded over centuries through influential tribal families. The Humaid clan of the Bani Khalid tribe controlled the prosperous Hasa province from the 17th century, while the Saud family, emirs of Diriya, allied with the puritanical religious reformer Muhammad Wahhab in 1744. \nAkin to the \u2018Pope\u2019 of Sunni Islam, the Ottoman Sultan maintained control over the lucrative trade routes in Hijaz, including the pilgrimage site of Mecca. Governing Mecca since the 10th century, the Hashemite Sharifs, who claimed descent from Prophet Muhammad, were protected first by the Mamluks and later by the Ottoman Sultanate. However, Saudi and Wahhabi forces attacked Karbala in 1801, took Mecca in 1803, and raided Iraqi villages until Pasha Muhammad Ali of Egypt reestablished Hashemite rule over Hijaz in 1813 and destroyed Diriya in 1818. Although the Sauds retook Riyadh in 1824 and expanded their territory, Muhammad Rashid took Riyadh by 1887, and the Saud family fled to Kuwait.\nWhile traditionally more tolerant of usury than Christianity, Islam split economic control by sect. In Shia Islam, daughters could inherit without sons, while more egalitarian Sunnis favored male cousins. For centuries, the Sunni-Shia divide influenced power structures, resource distribution, and community interactions beyond religion. Unlike Qatar, Kuwait, or the sheikhdoms that became the United Arab Emirates (\u201cUAE\u201d), Bahrain\u2019s Sunni Khalifa ruling family seized power in the late 18th century. This led to the Sunni dominating leadership and commerce, while Shia primarily farmed and fished. Unlike Sunnis, Shia farmers had to pay poll and water taxes. Few Shia became wazirs, responsible for land and rent, creating a divide between the ruling elite and the larger impoverished Shia population.\nIn Kuwait, Sunni-Shia segregation persisted as they practiced endogamy and separated schools and other services. Likewise, this division entrenched economic roles. Descending from central Arabian Bani Utub clans, the Ghanim, Qatami, Sagar, Roumi-Shamlan, and Badr families migrated the early 18th century to form Kuwait under the leadership of the Sabah family. Intermarriages between customary these wealthy Sunni trading families and the ruling Sabah family reinforced alliances. While the Shia managed the water-carrying trade exclusively, the Sunni families monopolized pearling, shipbuilding, and long-distance trades. As the ruling family operated as a weak political institution, the ruler relied on court favorites and merchants rather than family for governance. While Sunnis had direct informal family links to the ruler, the Shias communicated through his wazirs.\nIn Syrian Palestine, the Husayni, descended from the Prophet Muhammad, had been among the most prominent tax farmers of Jerusalem. In 1833, their power waned when Muhammad Ali\u2019s son abolished the special poll tax paid by Christians and Jews and imposed new taxes on all Syrians. Still, the family remained powerful. Salim Husayni had been Mayor of Jerusalem for 15 years until 1897, during which he paved the roads of the Western Wall for the Jews. After Fidi Alami briefly held the post, Hussein Husayni became Mayor in 1910.\nStill, Palestine suffered from lawless crime on one hand, and environmental degradation from poor laws on the other hand. Ottoman policies such as communal landownership and taxes on fruit-bearing trees accelerated deforestation across the region. This changed after <italic>Hirsch</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> funded <italic>Jewish Colonization Association </italic>for Russian emigrants. \nWhile Arabs reigned Palestine under Ottoman rule, relationships with Jews were constructive. Since Sephardi Turks started <italic>Valero Bank</italic> in Jerusalem in 1848, they funded Haifa\u2019s first railroad in 1888 and Jaffa\u2019s first Jewish commercial bank in 1903, founded by the Zionist <italic>Jewish Colonial Trust</italic> and later known as <italic>Anglo-Palestine Bank</italic>. In 1904, <italic>Anglo-Palestine Bank</italic> Hebron opened under the management of Eliezer Slonim, son of the local Chief Rabbi, Yakov Slonim. Since the Slonim family\u2014Katz descendants and cousins of Luria-Epstein bankers\u2014immigrated from Russian Lithuania in the mid-1800s, they led Hebron\u2019s Ashkenazi community. Eliezer soon served as the only Jewish member of the Hebron municipal council.\nFollowing the Young Turk revolution, <italic>Jerusalem Chamber of Commerce </italic>(\u201cJCC\u201d) started in 1909 to unite Palestine\u2019s Muslims, Christians, and Jews for local infrastructure development. The Ottoman government authorized JCC to form <italic>Commercial Bank of Palestine</italic> (\u201cCBP\u201d) and a canal project to provide water to Jerusalem under the condition only Ottoman educated subjects be allowed to participate. CBP raised money from leading merchants, JCC members, and through the sale of smaller-scale shares to Arab Palestinians. \nSalim Husayni\u2019s nephew Ismael, Joseph Wafas, and Nissim Eliachar were the bank\u2019s directors. When CBP opened to customers; Selim Ayoub, a Christian Ottoman citizen and the Persian consul-general at Jerusalem, became manager, assisted by Eliachar\u2019s son. While Eliachar\u2019s daughter wed into the Kokia banking family, their daughter married a Valero of <italic>Anglo-Palestine Bank. </italic>Valero considered the locally managed CBP would have a better chance at securing public works concessions than British registered banks with Jewish managers. \nWhile CBP publicly raised funds and a canal concession, Mayor Alami secretly signed a separate concession with <italic>Jewish Colonization Association</italic>\u2019s Henri Frank to provide water from another site. After CBP and JCC lobbying collapsed <italic>Franck</italic>\u2019s concession, CBP hired a German engineer to bid for a new concession by 1911. Although Ottoman Greek Orthodox developer Euripide Mavrommatis with financing from regional French Catholic bankers led by <italic>P\u00e9rier </italic>gained a concession to develop water, electric tramways, and electricity in Jerusalem in 1914, WWI ceased development.\nDuring WWI, Britain promised Arabs inland Syria to revolt against German-allied Turks. In the Arab Revolt of 1916, the Shia descendant of Prophet Muhammad\u2019s blood, Hashemite Husayn Sharif, proclaimed himself \u2018<italic>King of the Arab lands.</italic>\u2019 After WWI, Turkey\u2019s loss of territory with the <italic>Treaty of S\u00e8vres</italic> in 1920 and the subsequent <italic>Greco-Turkish War</italic> fueled Turkish nationalist sentiment, which opposed the Ottoman ruling house, now under European influence. In 1922, Mustafa Kemal led the movement that deposed and exiled Sultan Abdmajid II and abolished the Ottoman sultanate, and in 1924, dissolved the caliphate. While the Sultan and his family fled to France, Hyderabad\u2019s wealthy ruler, Nizam Khan, married his sons to descendants of Ottoman Sultans to tie their Islamic heritage and status in the 1930s. \nSince Abdulaziz Saud captured Riyadh from the Rashids in 1902, he annexed Rashid\u2019s Asir by 1921. Likewise, Saud\u2019s forces won a decisive victory against the Hashimites in 1919, he took Mecca and forced Husayn into exile. After a year-long siege, Jeddah surrendered in 1925, and Saud was declared King of Hejaz within weeks, and established the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. Although Husayn lost his claim to Hejaz, one of his sons became King of Jordan while the other became a King of Iraq and Syria. \nWWI and antisemitism increased Jewish immigration to Palestine. While Russian pogroms leading Golda Meir\u2019s family to flee Ukraine for America after 1903, she moved to Palestine only after WWI. As Chaim Weizmann led a Zionist mission to Palestine in 1918, Ismael Husayni welcomed him to his hotel. But as Ismael\u2019s cousin Mayor Hussein Husayni died that year, Hussein\u2019s brother, Musa, the Governor of Yemen under the Ottomans, became Mayor of Jerusalem while he was home on leave. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, Musa started a bloody antisemitic riot, leading the British to replace him as mayor with Raghib Nashashibi from a powerful rival clan. The next year, the British installed Musa\u2019s nephew, Amin Husayni, as Mufti of Jerusalem, giving him control over Islamic courts and religious endowments. While Ismael received shares from <italic>OIL</italic> and participated in the British Board of Advisors in 1923, he withdrew from politics as Arab Palestinian notables criticized him. \nLikewise, Iraqis revolted against British colonial rule. The British responded by deploying thousands of troops to quell the uprising. The British had originally expected their control over Iraq to last only a few months, but violence persisted and occupation lasted decades.  While King Faisal appointed Yehezkiel Sassoon as his first Finance Minister, and remained cordial with the Jews until his death in 1932, the pro-British reformists faced opposition from Baghdad-born Rashid Gaylani, a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s bloodline and Qadir Jilani, founder of the Qadiriyya Sufi order, whose family held the hereditary leadership roles in Baghdad multiple times. He became an appeal court judge in 1921 and Minister of Justice in 1924. In 1930, he co-founded a party to oppose the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. He served as PM in 1933 and as Minister of Interior in 1935. \nUnder British occupation, <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> expanded into Palestine, largely due to Shimon Mizrahi\u2019s efforts in 1918 to establish branches in Jerusalem and Jaffa. Descended from the Rabbi Shimon Mizrahi of Baghdad on his father\u2019s side and the Hasson family of Rhodes through his mother, Jerusalem-born Shimon Mizrahi was a senior clerk with <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> in Cairo. By 1920, <italic>Barclay</italic> bought <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic>. In response to antisemitic riots in Jaffa in 1921, Mizrahi provided a loan to purchase land in Tel Aviv to allowed Jewish families and businesses to relocate from Jaffa to a safer area, strengthening Tel Aviv as a commercial hub, where <italic>Barclay</italic> soon branched. Other executives of the Israel bank included Russian rabbinical heir Eliezer Rabinowitz and Katz and Luria descendant Moshe Luria.\nIn the 1920s, Soviet engagement with the Arab world was limited and pragmatic, with communist movements dominated by ethnic and religious minorities\u2014including Jews such as Haim Auerbach and Henry Curiel\u2014who played key roles in organizing activity in Cairo. Moscow encouraged broader local involvement mainly for strategic purposes, not ideological concern, and early Arab recruits were often converted tactically to fit social norms. While Zionist Marxists formed <italic>Bank Hapoalim</italic> in 1921 to support workers in Palestine, attempts to raise American funds were largely unsuccessful. \nAmong Israel\u2019s earliest and most stable communal agriculturalists was a group of immigrants from the Ukrainian village of Romny. Also of Romny, Pinchase Rutenberg became an engineer and supported the Russian Revolution before fleeing the Soviet Union for Palestine. There, he gained the support of British Lord Rothschild and <italic>British </italic>GE to monopolize hydroelectricity and irrigation via <italic>Palestine Electric Co</italic> (\u201cPEC\u201d) over protest from Arabs and Mavrommatis by 1923. But PEC continued. \nSince annexing Hejaz, Saudi Arabia allowed Jeddah\u2019s merchants to form a commercial assembly in 1926, continued the Ottoman and Hashemite economic structures under Saudi rule. The assembly\u2019s foreign merchants included the Dutch banker Van Pol, who adopted the name Muhammad Mahdi. The same year, <italic>Dutch East Indies Co </italic>successor <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> founded <italic>Saudi Hollandi Bank</italic> in Jeddah to serve the pilgrims from the Dutch East Indies. \nAlthough the bank did not take deposits or make loans, she operated as Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank for many years by maintaining the country\u2019s gold stock. But debts mounted as the Depression declined Mecca pilgrimage revenues. In 1933, Saudi Arabia signed an agreement with <italic>OIL of California</italic> over <italic>Anglo-Persian</italic> to control oil exploration and exports, with <italic>Saudi Hollandi</italic> processing the transactions.\nEarlier, mirroring Russian antisemitism, Ottoman anti-Armenian sentiment burst out in pogroms from Constantinople to Lebanon in 1895. As Greek Catholic families fled Lebanon, some arrived in Nigeria to lead trade, while another, Helu, soon dominated commerce in Mexico, and still others fled across Latin America. Still, after years of Tanzimat reforms, Constantinople had over forty private banks, with eight owned by Jews and no Muslims. \nLike the Greek Orthodox Sursock in the 1830s, Lebanon\u2019s the Greek Catholic (Maronite) Antoine Chiha and his father-in-law Raphael Faroun parlayed their raw silk profits to create <italic>Pharaon Chiha</italic>. After the Ottoman Empire collapsed in Lebanon, tension arose with the French arrival in Beirut in 1920, leading to friction among Muslims, Druze, and Maronites due to the French misunderstanding of Lebanon\u2019s diverse religious fabric. \nThe French replaced Ottoman civil servants with French counterparts but maintained a council of Lebanese elites. Emile \u00c9dd\u00e9 and Bechara Khouri became prominent politicians. While \u00c9dd\u00e9 married a Sursock and garnered support in Kesrouane and the north, Sursock-cousin Khouri married financier Michel Chiha\u2019s sister, bolstering his influence in Beirut and gained support from Chiha\u2019s wealthy Faroun cousins. \nThe 1926 constitution, guided by Chiha, aimed to pave Lebanon\u2019s path to statehood by emphasizing Arabic alongside French as an official language and promoting merit-based governance, disregarding religious affiliations. As Greek Orthodox Charles Debbas became the first President, Khouri and \u00c9dd\u00e9 alternated as PMs until 1930, with Khouri eventually gaining more influence. With continuing religious tension, an unwritten tradition developed that the President of the Republic must be a Christian Maronite, the Prime Minister a Sunni Muslim, and the Speaker of the House a Shiite Muslim. (Since fleeing Lebanon from Ottoman pogroms at the turn of the century, some Maronites led trade in Nigeria and elsewhere in Africa, while another, Helu, soon dominated commerce in Mexico, and still others fled across Latin America.)\nMeanwhile, Riad Solh, the son of a reformist Ottoman Vice Governor of Nabatiyyah and Saida, faced persecution by the French due to his pan-Arabism. In 1935, he married Fayza Jabiri, the sister of Syria\u2019s Minister of Foreign Affairs and future PM. Committed to creating a nation that welcomed Christians, Sunnis, and Shia, Riad became Lebanon\u2019s first Finance Minister and later PM. Jews were also welcome without political power. \nSince the Ottoman genocides challenged Armenians from the 1890s, the aristocratic Sarofim and other Christian Copt landowning families increased their influence since the 1870s with financing from European Jews. Shortly before dying in 1920, Sephardi Joseph Cattaui\u2014whose brother-in-law Raphael Suar\u00e9s founded <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic> and <italic>Aswan Dam</italic> with Britain\u2019s Court Jew Ernest Cassel at the turn of the century\u2014co-founded <italic>Misr Bank</italic> with Egyptians to support Arab traders to finance industry, commerce, and agricultural ventures, including Egypt\u2019s textiles and sugar-refining. Most of <italic>Misr Bank</italic>\u2019s founders hailed from wealthy Egyptian landowning families. With a degree from <italic>Egyptian Law School</italic>, Takat Harb joined <italic>Credit Fonder Egyptien</italic> and earned the respect of directors Suar\u00e9s, Rolo, and Cattaui. \nAdvocating for an Egyptian-owned bank, Harb met Midhat Yakin, a descendant of Pasha Muhammad Ali\u2019s sister. With a European education and law degree, Yakin made a fortune during the cotton land boom of 1920. Yakin was a close associate of the king and cousin of the prime minister. <italic>Misr Bank</italic> soon formed nine joint-stock companies. While the largest was <italic>Cotton Spinning & Weaving Co</italic>, others included <italic>Paper Manufacturing Co</italic>, <italic>Fisheries Co</italic>, <italic>Flax Co</italic>, <italic>Silk Weaving Co</italic>, and <italic>Trading & Cotton Ginning Co</italic>. The latter opened its first factory in the hometown of the largest shareholder, while another factory opened where Yakin owned land. However, <italic>Misr Bank</italic>\u2019s reliance on landowners proved to be a weakness when the economic depression hit this class. \nAs most of Egypt\u2019s banking system was foreign owned into the 1920s, ruinous competition persisted until banks began cooperating to open clearinghouses in Cairo and Alexandria from 1928. From then, the sole Egyptian-led bank, <italic>Misr Bank</italic> had close ties to the new <italic>Beige Bank</italic>, established in 1929 by <italic>Sino-Belge Bank</italic>, America\u2019s <italic>Chase</italic> NB, and Swiss <italic>Commerciale Bank of Bale</italic>. An extended cousin-in-law of Cattaui, Sephardi Jacob Safra had moved from Syrian Aleppo to Beirut, where he thrived converting worthless notes into gold after WWI. By 1927, fellow Sephardi Khedouri Zilkha branched <italic>Zilkha Bank</italic> from Iraq to Syria, followed by Cairo and Alexandria. As Iraq\u2019s fiscal agent, <italic>Zilkha </italic>handled official contributions to the Arab League.\nWithin a year in Cairo, Hassan Banna founded <italic>Muslim Brotherhood</italic> in 1928 to address poverty and unemployment. He began by speaking in local coffeehouses and gained widespread support. By 1935, Banna\u2019s brother branched <italic>Brotherhood</italic> to Syrian Palestine. From the southern West Bank city of Nablus, Sheikh Mohammed Jabari studied spiritualism at Cairo\u2019s <italic>Azhar Uni</italic> before returning home in 1922 to teach at the Ibrahimi Mosque, practice sharia law, and represent Hebron at congress. \nBy 1929, tensions between Jews and Arabs in Hebron escalated amid rising anxieties over Zionist land purchases. As Mufti of Jerusalem Amin Husayni accused Jews of plotting to seize the Western Wall, Jabari incited anger among Arabs. Despite warnings, <italic>Anglo-Palestine Bank</italic> Hebron\u2019s Eliezer Slonim, the sole Jew on Hebron\u2019s municipal council, declined armed protection believing in long-standing coexistence. On August 23, following riots in Jerusalem, hundreds of Arabs descended on Hebron. As several dozen Jews sought refuge in Slonim\u2019s home, the mob broke in and murdered all inside.\nAs murderous Arab riots soared, Britain began restricting Jewish immigration and land purchase in Palestine. By 1930, Arab Abdel Shoman founded <italic>Arab Bank </italic>after returning to Jerusalem after emigration to America in 1920. <italic>Arab Bank</italic> Jerusalem soon promoted Yusuf Beidas. Born to a Russian Orthodox missionary in Acre, Beidas started as a bank messenger boy, eventually becoming a clerk at <italic>Barclay</italic> Jerusalem in the 1930s, and subsequently a director at <italic>Arab Bank</italic> in that city. A distinguished banker by the 1940s, he married into the ancient Arab Christian Ghassan dynasty.\nRooted in the northern Nablus for centuries, the large Sunni Masri family engaged in trade and commerce. While Nablus depended on producing soap for export, revenues shrank as Egypt imposed import tariffs and domestic production grew in Syria and Lebanon. Increasingly from 1927, Nablus merchants sought electrification and pushed for connections to PEC\u2019s grid. As owners of oil franchises from<italic> Shell</italic> and<italic> Socony-Vacuum</italic>, West Bank councilmen Taher Masri and Abd Tamimi sought to protect existing generator-based electricity revenues, and proposed a JV that would be majority owned by the Nablus municipality. Fearing sabotage, PEC insisted on direct agreements. By 1936, Nablus\u2019 Mayor, merchants, and landowners called for an agreement with PEC. Leading the opposition, Taher\u2019s son Hikmat waged a general strike. Only the \u2018essential\u2019 <italic>Masri</italic> flour mill continued operating. \nIn 1935, Mohammed Jabari joined <italic>Palestine Arab Party</italic>, led by Jamal Husayni, and his brother Amin, the Mufti of Jerusalem. While the British temporarily imprisoned the activists, terrorism resurged in 1937. As Britain proposed a partition in 1937 (with 70% going to Arabs), most Arabs reconsidered their opposition to cooperation with Jews. They recognized that partition would hinder economic progress, impacting laborers\u2019 desire for Jaffa\u2019s port revival, the middle-class seeking market prosperity, and the upper class aiming for land value increases. T\nhis realization sparked widespread protests as Arabs feared losing the benefits of Jewish investment and development. Likewise, Arab leaders suppressed extremist influences by suspending newspapers, enabling independent thinking. In the West Bank, however, Mohammed Jabari continued advocating to reject partition in the south, while Nablus remained without electricity for decades, and fell behind developmentally as Masri power grew in the north. And as the British refused to allow Jamal and Amin Husayni, who fled to Lebanon and then Syria, helping form the Central Committee of the Jihad.\nThe deepening Great Depression continued changing the Middle East. As Japan invented cultured pearls, Kuwait\u2019s leading Sunni merchants felt the competition and criticized the ruler\u2019s communication with Shias via wazirs by the 1930s. Along with organized political opposition, the rise of oil revenues catalyzed a shift in power dynamics. From the rebellion of 1938, rulers centralized authority and divided state responsibilities among family factions. Family ties extended into key business roles, as Abdalla represented significant companies like <italic>Kuwait Oil Co</italic>, <italic>Sulphur Co</italic>, and <italic>Electric</italic> <italic>Co.</italic> For example, when Sheik Abdalla died in 1955, his son became state secretary and oil company representative, while his daughter married the leader of the nationalist opposition. \nIn Saudi Arabia during this crisis, the annexation of Hejaz led to modern banking amidst opposition stemmed from Islamic fundamentalists\u2019 objections to <italic>riba</italic> (interest) and their association of banks with non-believers. Local moneylenders and moneychangers advocated for the exclusion of foreign banks, arguing they could provide Islamic-compliant services. However, Salim Mahfouz and the Kaki brothers of Hejaz petitioned the King for permission to establish a licensed bank, leveraging their devout Muslim identities. The Mahfouz descend from Hadhrami traders on the Yemeni border. By 1938, Mahfouz and Kaki secured a banking monopoly, <italic>Saudi</italic> <italic>National Commercial Bank</italic>, which soon became northern Yemen\u2019s only bank, and ultimately the Middle East\u2019s largest bank by assets. However, the King excluded Jewish <italic>Misr Bank</italic> and American <italic>Citi</italic>.\nInstead of Sunni-Shia competition, Indians dominated the East African trade and finance for centuries while Arabs ruled politically. Since the Omani Sultanate gained control over much of East Africa, the Sultan of Zanzibar conceded British control over the region in 1887. Following Zanzibar\u2019s establishment as a British protectorate in 1890, adjacent to German East Africa, Mombasa was formally incorporated into British East Africa in 1895, which remained part of the Sultanate of Zanzibar within the Kenya Protectorate.\nBefore the 20th century, north Nigerian Hausa led the West African nut trade. By the turn of the century, Lebanese trade caravans stretched from Lagos to Lake Chad. Since the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, British West Africa\u2019s palm oil industry shifted to more capitalized and structured industry with the entry of <italic>West African Co</italic>, <italic>British & Continental African Co</italic> (took over <italic>Co of African Merchants</italic>), <italic>Niger Co</italic> (1879), and <italic>Couper Johnstone</italic> (1879). \nWhile George Goldie\u2019s father descended from an old Scottish family and became a Lieutenant Colonel of the Scots Guard and a Speaker of the lower Manx Parliament, his mother was a Taubman,<italic> </italic>one of the two leading families of the Isle of Man<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic>cousin-in-laws of<italic> </italic><italic>Smyth</italic> and <italic>Barclay</italic>. Upon his inheritance, Goldie resigned from the military, explored Africa, and took over <italic>Central African Trading Co</italic> in 1875. Merging with three British merchants in 1879, he created what became <italic>Niger Co.</italic> After further consolidating the Niger trade, <italic>Niger Co</italic> secured a Royal Charter in 1886 with administrative rights over the Niger Delta with a commercial monopoly in the region. While <italic>Niger Co</italic> lost her administrative rights in 1900, Goldie left after the death of his wife. \nWilliam Lever, born in Britain to a Congregational family, founded <italic>Lever</italic> in 1885, establishing a soap factory in Warrington amid the economic depression of the 1880s. <italic>Lever</italic> pioneered vertical integration, controlling production from raw materials to distribution, which enabled rapid international expansion, establishing operations from Africa to America as American tariffs and deflation attracted <italic>Alabama Coal, Iron, Land, & Colonization Co</italic> and other British direct investors.\nBy 1889 the nine largest British West Africa\u2019s palm oil traders\u2014<italic>Harrison</italic>, <italic>British & Continental African Co</italic>, <italic>Couper Johnstone</italic>, <italic>Hatton Cookson</italic>, <italic>Helt Cotterell</italic>, <italic>King</italic>, <italic>Stuart</italic> <italic>Douglas</italic>, <italic>Taylor Laughland</italic>, and George Watts\u2014merged to form <italic>African Association </italic>in Liverpool to dominate the palm oil trade. After ruinous competition with other companies, <italic>African Association</italic> formed <italic>Niger Pool</italic> with <italic>Niger Co</italic>, <italic>Miller</italic>, and a smaller company.\nAlfred Jones born in Wales to a former owner of <italic>The Welshman</italic> newspaper and the daughter of Reverend Henry Williams, moved with his family to Liverpool, where he attended local schools and, in 1859, became a cabin boy with <italic>African Steamship Co </italic>(\u201cASC\u201d). In 1863, he started as a junior clerk at ASC\u2019s managing agent,<italic> Laird</italic> <italic>Fletcher</italic>, later becoming the manager. After losing ASC in 1878, Jones established his own shipping and insurance brokerage. \nAs he chartered a steamship to West Africa in 1879, <italic>Elder Dempster </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> hired him to join <italic>British &</italic> <italic>African Steam Navigation Co </italic>to avoid competition. By 1884, Jones had bought out the founding partners and took control of <italic>Elder Dempster </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>. After negotiating an agreement with Adolph Woermann\u2019s <italic>German-African Shipping</italic> in 1890, <italic>Elder Dempster </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> became managing agents for ASC, where Jones acquired a 75% share. Jones formed <italic>West Africa Shipping Conference</italic> in 1895 and diversified into various sectors.\nBy then, Marseille\u2019s Greek community of elites contrasted sharply with its 54,000 Italians. Prominent among them were the Chiot Rodocanachi, who moved from Livorno to Marseille in 1826 and established the trading house <italic>Rodocanachi</italic> Marseille, linked with Syros, Odessa, Livorno, and Chios. By 1845, fellow Greek Georges Zarifi established a grain trading network in Odessa and a branch in Marseille, specializing in Black Sea grain trade. Associated with <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, Georges Zarifi\u2019s son Pericles married Rodocanachi\u2019s daughter.\nSince importing Russian wheat, Demetrius Baltazzi arrived in Marseille in the 1830s and a Director of <italic>Comptoir</italic> Marseille from 1848. From 1853, Bordeaux and <italic>Comptoir </italic>controlled <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic>. When <italic>Comptoir</italic> Marseille and <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic> established operational links in 1879 to settle accounts with <italic>Fraissinet </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> and other merchants, the families invested debt and equity into steamship services to West Africa through <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> and <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise de l</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Afrique Occidentale</italic> (\u201cCFAO\u201d) from 1887. \nA HC for ventures from 1887, CFAO helped Huguenot <italic>Fraissinet</italic> and <italic>Fabre</italic> shippers organize into <italic>Fabre Fraissinet</italic> in 1889. Likewise, Pericles\u2019 son Georges interconnected with fellow Greek Vagliano merchant shipping heiress. <italic>Zarifi</italic> accumulated vast holdings, including Marseille oil works, sugar mills, breweries, North African businesses, and Greek banks and railways. \nWith investments ranging from oil works and cotton ginning in Dahomey and Togo, CFAO and other Marseille and Bordeaux merchants and shipowners, reorganized <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic> into <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> (\u201cBFWA\u201d) in 1901, with the right to issue currency across French West Africa, expanding into Equatorial Africa, Togo, and Cameroon. The capital was allocated with 60% for Bordeaux, 20% for <italic>Comptoir</italic>, and 20% for Marseille stakeholders, including CFAO. CFAO directors included <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic>\u2019s Henri Nouvion, <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2019s Emile Mercet, Fould and Lazard in-law Gaston Gradis, <italic>Fabre Fraissinet</italic>\u2019s Paul Cyprien-Fabre and Marc Fraissinet, and Greek <italic>Zarifi</italic> Marseille<italic>.</italic>  By 1904, L\u00e9on Zarifi of Marseille became a Director of<italic> Bank of Athens</italic>, partnered with <italic>Parisienne</italic> since 1896.\nAlso in 1904, BFWA gained the privilege to participate in company formations\u2014a right denied to BDF\u2014as France broadened <italic>Bank of Algeria </italic>into the neighboring protectorate of Tunisia.  Banks formed in German Colonial East Africa, Togoland, and Cameroon as Germany challenged French control of Morocco, Britain\u2019s Ernest Cassel\u2014and head of <italic>Hirsch</italic> following Maurice Hirsch\u2019s death\u2014established the note-issuing <italic>Bank of Morocco</italic> to support France that year.  \nLike they did in Algeria and Tunisia, Livornese Jews connected Libya to Europe. Leading Tripoli\u2019s Jewish community by the 18th century, the Nahum and Arbib families moved to Britain and marry partnering with cousin-in-laws of one another and the Tunisian Cesana families to trade African goods and English cloth from the 1870s. Kinterlinking with the Sassoon, Cattaui, and Lumbroso Boccara families around 1907, <italic>Arbib</italic> initiated the expansion of <italic>Banco di Roma</italic>, followed by <italic>Nahum </italic>adopting a similar strategy with<italic> Italian Colonial Society</italic>. By 1911, Italy had occupied Libya. \nBack in 1894, <italic>Elder Dempster Shipping\u2019</italic>s Alfred Jones\u2014born into a Welsh clerical family before moving to Liverpool\u2014led the formation and became Chair of <italic>Bank of British West Africa</italic> (\u201cBBWA\u201d) to take over the exclusive right to import coins in 1894, with other directors including F.W. Bond, Chair of <italic>African Steamship </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>; Henry Coke, Liverpool agent for <italic>Sassoon</italic>; and Edward Lawrence, a Liverpool merchant.\nHowever, <italic>Nige</italic>r <italic>Co</italic>\u2019s <italic>Anglo-African Bank</italic> broke BBWA\u2019s monopoly in 1899. Renamed <italic>Bank of Nigeria</italic> in 1905, it engaged in fierce competition with BBWA. As Jones died in 1909, Owen Philipps and William James bought the estate. By 1912, BBWA took over <italic>Bank of Nigeria</italic>, restoring her monopoly with over 40 branches. \nOwners of <italic>Royal Mail </italic><italic>Shipping</italic><italic> </italic>and extended cousin-in-laws of several of <italic>Royal Mail </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>\u2019s founding families, the Philipps were related to Anglican clergy, Welsh bankers, and extended cousin-in-laws of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> affiliated Vivians. In 1888, Philipps had also married a Jewish heiress, Lenora Gerstenberg, whose father had been affiliated with <italic>Bauer</italic> Manchester and founded <italic>Council of Foreign Bondholders</italic>. With <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>, the Philipps invested in Baku oil.\nIn search of reliable sources of raw materials, <italic>Lever</italic> secured a concession in the Belgian Congo to grow oil palms in 1911. In British West Africa, such backward integration was not possible, and instead <italic>Lever</italic> bought <italic>Maclver</italic>, a Liverpool trading company founded by Glasgow merchants focused on Nigeria timber to expand into the palm oil trade connected with <italic>Cunard </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>. By 1912, Britain introduced <italic>Kano-Lagos</italic> RR and <italic>West Africa Currency Board </italic>as a central banker and <italic>Barclay</italic> entered Nigeria. After WWI, <italic>Balfour Beatty</italic> expanded PUs in East Africa, including Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. \nTo stabilize the banking sector during WWI, Colonial officials solidified BBWA\u2019s monopoly by requiring her to handle government accounts exclusively and manage remittances. However, <italic>Colonial Bank</italic> started in 1917, reintroducing competition, which intensified amidst Nigeria\u2019s currency crisis from 1918. While BBWA sought a larger share of the limited silver coinage available, a consortium of commercial banks effectively took control of BBWA\u2019s operations in 1919 and split British West African banking with <italic>Colonial Bank</italic>. As <italic>Standard</italic> acquired <italic>African Banking Corp</italic> and an interest in BBWA with <italic>Lloyd</italic> by 1920, <italic>Barclay</italic> bought <italic>Colonial Bank </italic>in 1925. The same year, BBWA\u2019s leading stockholder,<italic> Elder Dempster </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>\u2019s Owen Philipps, reaffirmed relations with <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> as his daughter wed a Baring descendant related to the Glyns. Soon after, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Mocatta cousin married a great niece of BBWA\u2019s deceased inaugural Chair Alfred Jones.\nAfter WWI, British and American producers implemented global cartels in copper, wool, and coffee, free<italic> </italic>trade prevailed as the Dutch refused to join. The global rubber cartel of 1922 failed as it discriminated against America, and prices fell. So did rubber and tin price agreements. Since Gaston Gradis helped found <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> (\u201cBFWA\u201d), Raoul Gradis wed Katz-descendant Suzanne Gunzburg Fould in 1888, and their son, also named Gaston, married French oil magnate Emile Deutsch-Meurthe\u2019s niece WWI in 1919. As <italic>Deutsch-Meurthe </italic>joined <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Shell</italic> to form a company to monopolize Iraqi oil, the latter Gaston became the head of various transport and trading businesses. \nBy then, arms dealer Basil Zaharoff was a director of <italic>Creusot</italic>, <italic>Shell</italic>, and <italic>Parisienne</italic>. Zaharoff, was related to the Greek oil shipping banker <italic>Zarifi</italic> of Constantinople and Marseille and Director of French Colonial West African of CFAO HC, with BFWA interests. By 1922, Zarifi married an aristocratic British Yorke, in-law of Earl Rendlesham, the son of an ennobled Huguenot Thellusson and cousin of the Spencer and Churchill families.\nFrench shipping consolidated around <italic>Chargeurs R\u00e9unis</italic> and <italic>Fabre Fraissinet</italic>, leveraging mutual ties with CFAO to dominate West African trade routes. After WWI, CFAO started <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Commerciale et Industrielle de la C\u00f4te d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Afrique</italic> in 1917, with Marc Fraissinet as Chair. In 1920, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and Octave Homberg founded <italic>French & Colonial </italic>HC, focusing on rubber and East Asia as well as companies in Equatorial Africa. \nAlthough competition with Germany ended after WWI, France faced increased threat from Belgium. Since SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>, <italic>Lambert</italic>, and others funded <italic>Bank of Belgian Congo </italic>and<italic> Banque Commerciale du Congo</italic> around 1908, the Congo\u2019s banking sector grew. British <italic>Standard Bank</italic> of South Africa opened a branch in Elisabethville. Portuguese <italic>National Overseas Bank</italic> opened a branch in Kinshasa, later joined by <italic>Banco de Angola</italic>. compete with SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> created <italic>Banque Belge d\u2019Afrique</italic> in 1923, with offices in L\u00e9opoldville, Elisabethville, Stanleyville, and Matadi. \nSo, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Transatlantique</italic>, SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Nationale</italic>, and <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic> established <italic>Banque Commerciale Africaine</italic>, under the former leadership of <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019Afrique</italic>, formed at the turn of the century. However, the French <italic>franc</italic> collapsed in 1925 led West African trader <italic>Chargeurs R\u00e9unis</italic> to seek financing from Daniel Dreyfus\u2014of the Dupont, Fould, and Lazard clan\u2014in 1926, intwining CFAO to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. Likewise, the Fraissinet and Fabre families wed in 1927, bringing <italic>Fabre </italic>and <italic>Fraissinet</italic> closer and operating routes and agencies jointly from 1929. As <italic>Nationale</italic> branched to London and supported trade between French-speaking and English-speaking Africa, <italic>Banque Commerciale Africaine</italic>\u2019s capital increased by 500% and<italic> </italic>BFWA and <italic>Sud-Lumi\u00e8re</italic> formed <italic>Union Electrique Coloniale</italic>.\nAt the same time, shareholdings dispersed. After WWI, <italic>Works of Marseille </italic>PUHC expanded its shareholder base from 17 in 1913 to 1,352 in 1918 and 3,373 by 1930. <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> and <italic>Transatlantique Bank</italic>, the original founders, lost their controlling interest as share ownership became more dispersed. By 1929, around two-thirds of the shares were held by numerous small shareholders. <italic>French Thomson Houston</italic>, which had entered <italic>Works of Marseille </italic>PUHC\u2019s capital through a merger, saw her share fall from about 10% in 1930 to less than one by 1939. As this dispersion magnified the influence of P\u00e9ricl\u00e9s Zarifi and Andr\u00e9 Goulin, <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic>, <italic>Transatlantique Bank</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris allied with them.\nWhile <italic>British South Africa Co</italic> occupied Southern Rhodesia with hopes of finding mineral wealth, lack of such led them to turn into \u2018White agricultural policy\u2019 from 1907, exploiting land and labor from Black African to aid agricultural development for the White economy. After the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, the Southern Rhodesian referenda of in 1922 highlighted a divide between Europeans on Black African advancement. \nProfessionals were more supportive of changes to restrictive practices. The divide was evident in political alignments, with colonial civil servants differing from miners, traders, and farmers. Little capital entered Rhodesia as the Settler State established enterprises and excluded Africans from significant participation in the economy. The <italic>Land Commission of 1925</italic> recommended the <italic>Land Apportionment Act of 1930</italic>, dividing land by race, reducing land available to the Black African majority and increasing their reliance on wage labor for subsistence. \nIn 1929, <italic>American Smelting & Refining Co</italic> attempted to acquire the N\u2019Changa copper deposits in Northern Rhodesia. <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>\u2019s Ernest Oppenheimer, <italic>Rothschild </italic>London, <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>\u2019s Auckland Geddes, and other members of the British and South African business community opposed this move as a threat to British interests in the region\u2019s mineral wealth. With support from <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>, Geddes and Oppenheimer successfully thwarted the American takeover. By 1930, <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> had acquired substantial holdings in Northern Rhodesia\u2019s copper-belt, merging <italic>Northern Rhodesian Copperbelt Co</italic>, <italic>N</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Changa Consolidated Copper Mines</italic>, and <italic>Bwana M</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Kubwa Mines</italic> into <italic>Rhokana</italic> <italic>Corp</italic> under the chairmanship of Auckland Geddes.\nAlso in 1929, <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>\u2019s Ernest Oppenheimer became Chair of <italic>DeBeers</italic>, and began vertically integrating and cartelizing diamond overproduction amid the global recession. By 1930, <italic>DeBeers</italic>, CDM, <italic>Premier</italic>, and other producers founded single central selling organization<italic> </italic><italic>Diamond Corp</italic>. As prices continued to deflate, <italic>Diamond Corp</italic> established <italic>Diamond Trading Co</italic> as a subsidiary in 1934 to sell rough diamonds at \u2018sights.\u2019 Concurrently, <italic>DeBeers</italic> joined a consortium of Belgian banks to found <italic>Antwerp Diamond Bank</italic> to lend diamond producers. \nOppenheimer negotiated a private treaty with Belgum to vend bort from <italic>Forminiere Mines</italic> to <italic>Industrial Diamond Corp</italic> in London, sell a stake in the Belgian Congo mines HC <italic>Sibeka</italic>, and for the the Belgian cutting industry to buy <italic>DeBeers</italic> gems. Likewise, members of <italic>Diamond Corp</italic>, representatives of the South African government, and the administration of Southern Africa formed <italic>Diamond Producers</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Association</italic> to pool and protect the market. Finally, <italic>Diamond Development Co</italic> formed to explore new uses for industrial diamonds. In sum, African diamonds were distributed in London and cut in Antwerp.\nAfter several West African Dutch margarine firms merged in 1919, <italic>Lazard</italic> London financed William Lever\u2019s <italic>Lever</italic> in acquiring <italic>Niger Co</italic> to secure palm and coconut oil supplies, which led <italic>African Association</italic> and <italic>Millers</italic> to form <italic>African & Eastern Trade Corp</italic>. Collapsed prices after the <italic>Panic of 1920</italic>, however, Lever lost control of <italic>Lever</italic> to <italic>Barclay</italic>, and diversified into motor distribution and other industrial ventures in West Africa. \nAs <italic>Rotterdam Bank</italic> interests merged five Dutch margarine firms into <italic>Margarine Union </italic>against ruinous competition in 1927, <italic>African & Eastern Trade Corp</italic> invited <italic>Shell</italic> Britain\u2019s Robert Waley Cohen to be Chair. After Cohen merged with <italic>Lever</italic>\u2019s <italic>Niger Co</italic> into <italic>United Africa Co</italic> (\u201cUAC\u201d) by 1929, <italic>Lever</italic> merged with <italic>Margarine Union </italic>into <italic>Unilever</italic> to stabilize the palm oil trade. Thereafter, French CFAO\u2019s investments soon included <italic>Palme</italic>\u2014with <italic>Unilever</italic> and <italic>Co Industrielle et Commerciale d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Afrique</italic>\u2014and BBWA.\nSince merging with <italic>African & Eastern </italic>and <italic>Niger Co</italic>, UAC dominated West African trade, and accused <italic>Elder Dempster </italic>of manipulating freight rates. As UAC\u2019s Cohen proposed to reorg trade, <italic>Elder Dempster</italic>\u2019s BBWA sought Colonial Office intervention to prevent UAC\u2019s monopolistic ambitions. By August 1930, a coalition of shipping, banking, and trading firms, supported by the Colonial Office, thwarted Cohen\u2019s plans, forcing him to resign. While short term losses grew, UAC bypassed banks for transactions between Britain and West Africa by arranging direct fund transfers with <italic>West Africa Currency Board</italic>. Disintermediating West Africa\u2019s bank cartel, UAC became the main supplier of British West African currency within a decade.\nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1930</italic>, depositors ran from colonial banks, which struggled due to a slump in oil and other raw material prices. <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019Afrique</italic> nearly suspended payments as her until receiving support from <italic>Marchal</italic>,<italic> Nationale</italic>, and a collateralized facility from BFWA, while <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> and <italic>Transatlantique </italic>faced runs but coped as the French Ministry aided colonial banks.\nWithin a few months, conditions deteriorated for <italic>Marchal</italic> and <italic>Nationale</italic>, leading their affiliated sub-Saharan Africa <italic>l\u2019Afrique</italic> and <italic>Banque Commerciale Africaine</italic>, suspended payments. As the Ministry allowed BFWA to issue banknotes to rescue <italic>Africaine</italic> and facilitated recapitalization by <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Transatlantique</italic>. <italic>Africaine </italic>then joined <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Chinoise</italic>, <italic>Industriel</italic>, <italic>Transatlantique</italic>, and <italic>Parisienne</italic> in reconstructing <italic>l\u2019Afrique</italic> under Ministry pressure and to counter the threat of <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>\u2019 <italic>Banque Belge d\u2019Afrique</italic>. BFWA remained French West Africa\u2019s dominant bank. \nSince marrying Antoinette Lazard Fould in 1930, Wladimir Archawski became Managing Director of <italic>Transatlantique Shipping</italic> and director of <italic>Commercial Bank of</italic><italic> Morocco</italic>,<italic> Bank of Tunisia</italic>, and <italic>Banque Commerciale Africaine</italic> from 1932.<italic> </italic>However, since <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and Octave Homberg founded <italic>French & Colonial</italic> HC to focus on rubber and companies in Equatorial Africa in 1920, losses by 1933 forced them to organize a syndicate with <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Indochine</italic>, and Edmond Estaing\u2014whose brother married the daughter of a former French President Sadi Carnot\u2014as Managing Director, later Chair, and Edmond Streel facilitating control over Gabon forestry with <italic>Co Commerciale de l\u2019Afrique \u00c9quatoriale</italic>.\nSince <italic>Union d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Electricit\u00e9</italic> PUHC\u2019s Ernest Mercier married Marguerite Dreyfus, the widow of Adolphe Reinach, niece of Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Dreyfus, cousin-in-law of Worms and Lazard, his son-in-law Wilfrid Baumgartner joined French Finance Ministry\u2019s General Movement of Funds as Deputy Director, the equivalent of UST Assistant Secretary, in 1929, and director in 1933. He led <italic>Nationale</italic> from 1936, with loan committee directors including Raymond Berr for the chemical industry, Henri Cah\u00e9n in electricity, Joseph Beghin representing sugar and newspapers, and Charles Fould and Ernest Mercier for electricity, petroleum, and banking. By 1937, Maurice Petsche, the son of Mercier\u2019s partner Albert Petsche, married Simone Lazard. A daughter of Lucie Goldschmidt and Andr\u00e9 Lazard, a son of one of the five founding brothers, Simone was widowed after the death of French Catholic aristocrat Paul Fressange.\n<italic>Niger Co</italic> credit allowed Yoruba princess Omu Okwei, a granddaughter of the Kings of Ossomari and Abo, to rise to prominence in Onitsha through trade by 1910. Okwei thrived by combining European and African customs. Her commitment to Western education led her sons into banking and overseas trade, with one entering the Civil Service while another was <italic>Niger Co</italic>\u2019s storekeeper. Following local custom, she grew a network of domestic servant agents to procure goods for her trade by adopting girls\u2014often received as debt pawns\u2014raising them and arranging marriages with regional chiefs and traders. Without slave-like property ownership rights, these arrangements ended when traders left Nigeria, and any offspring or possessions acquired during this time reverted to original owners. \nBBWA led the way in promoting local staff, starting as early as 1916 with educational incentives and share ownership for African employees. By 1918, two Africans were appointed as sub-branch managers, with further appointments in subsequent years. In contrast, East Africa relied on Indian staff until the 1950s. During the <italic>Great Depression</italic>, <italic>Standard Bank</italic> replaced European officers with Indian clerks for economic reasons in 1936. Since the 19th century, Indians established a significant economic presence on the East African coast. As British colonial rule progressed, Indian influence expanded into the interior regions. Led by a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad, the Shia Ismaili Aga Khan started <italic>Jubilee Insurance</italic> in 1936, offering loans to lower- and middle-income families in Kenya.\nSince WWI, Lebanese, Arab, and Yoruba traders arrived in Nigeria as intermediaries for Europeans, the nut and cotton trade expanded. Suspecting African middlemen of promoting slavery, Europeans extended advances to large traders. Along with the foreign funded competition, Hausa traders declined as Islamic courts continued to limit credit by banning usury. While the largest Hausa trader was UAC supplier Alhassan Dantata, several others also used Western credit. \nDantata was born in 1877 in Bebeji, Nigeria, into a prosperous Hausa Agalawa trading family. His grandfather allowed his slaves to keep earnings beyond a set amount, while Dantata\u2019s father specialized in textiles, cattle, and nuts. After his father\u2019s death, Dantata\u2019s mother moved to Accra, where she became a wealthy trader, leaving him in the care of a slave woman. Dantata struggled during his early years but gained experience in the nut trade. \nAfter <italic>Niger Co</italic> sought his expertise to buy nuts in 1918, he dominated this market. Dantata\u2019s wife managed a network of female agents to handle transactions with women, allowing Dantata to adhere to Islamic principles. When <italic>British Bank of West Africa</italic> Kano opened in 1929, he deposited 20 camel-loads of silver. Likewise, the Yoruba princess Omu Okwei dominated Igboland\u2019s internal trade, using local bank connections to  import costly gunpowder, ivory, and coral bead directly from British firms in the 1920s. Following family deaths by 1935, she became the Queen of Ossomari and her son the King of Nembe. \nAlthough British firms, in collusion with the colonial state, attempted to set prices and market commodities through involuntary compliance and sanctions, internal policing was inevitably troublesome, and cutthroat competition in the countryside continued. Alongside Lebanese Maronite traders, was Jewish Saul Raccah. Hailing from Tripoli, Raccah, the grandson of Chief Rabbi Elijah Hazan of Tripoli and Alexandria, migrated to Nigeria in 1915. In Kano, Saul contracted a marriage with a Lebanese woman, while his brother laid his foundations in Manchester. Raccah soon became UAC\u2019s largest nut competitor.\nSince Britain incorporated the predominantly Muslim Borno Emirate into Nigeria, she ruled indirectly through the ancient Shehu dynasty. The Shehu resided in Maiduguri, the provincial capital, which was central to trade with Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. Traders like Kyari Karda, Ari Musami, and Usman Maidawa were prominent figures. Karda, from Dabira, started trading in Monguno and later moved to Maiduguri around 1924. \nHe became a leading trader in cattle, nuts, Hausa cloths, and European goods, with a BBWA account. Musami, born in Maiduguri to a trader father, conducted long-distance trade with Chad and Cameroon. He transported cattle to Southern Nigeria cities and traded horses and cloths. While selling horses in Kano to Alhassan Dantata\u2019s son and Saul Raccah, he maintained strong ties with the Shehu\u2019s court. Maidawa, a Hausa trader from Kano, married the daughter of his landlord Malam Shuaibu and settled in Maiduguri. He operated large caravans and traded in cloth, nuts, and horses between Borno and Kano.\nDespite Islamic prohibitions against usury, these moneylenders operated within the constraints of their religion. In the 1920s, Maiduguri became a central financial hub with key moneychangers such as Abba Kalabuh, who was married to Shehu Umar Kanemi\u2019s daughter, and Bukar Machiji, who was also married to a daughter of the Shehu. Makinta Sanda, a former slave of the Shehu, managed transactions on his behalf, and Mala Karfe, another follower of the Shehu and was later offered the district headship of Gashua. Women in moneylending included Mabruka and Arima Kuseram, who was also a nut trader.\nWhile <italic>Barclay</italic> and BBWA restricted lending in Nigeria and transferred funds to London, citing volatility in crop prices, Ghanian Winifried Ansa organized Ghanian and Nigerian produce exports to compete. After taking over <italic>Industrial & Commercial Bank </italic>from British investors in 1924 and contracted with 45 associations accounting for 60% of West African cocoa. While deposits first grew, the bank was unable to repay her debt to <italic>Nigerian</italic> RR, and after unaccounted lending, wound down in 1930. \nAfter the first locally founded Nigerian bank started in 1929, Ansa founded <italic>Nigerian Mercantile Bank</italic> in 1931, but faced political backlash and soon shuttered along with the bank from 1929. Several directors left <italic>Nigerian Mercantile Bank</italic> to found <italic>Nigerian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>with Muslim Alhaji Gbadamosi in 1933. Hailing from the Yoruba Kuku dynasty ruling Ijebuland, Gbadamosi led nationalists against Westerners. After helping found, he initiated <italic>Ikorudu Trading </italic>by 1935, using Japanese machinery for textiles and diversifying into tobacco distribution, ceramics manufacturing, and brewing. He subsequently became a director of <italic>Guinness</italic> Nigeria, <italic>Nigerian</italic> RR, and <italic>Western Nigerian Development Corp</italic>. \nDuring this time, many Africans began local publishing houses focused on nationalism and anti-colonialism. One of these was Nnamdi \u201cZik\u201d Azikiwe, a descendant of the first king of Onitsha on his father\u2019s side and the thirteenth king of Onitsha on his mother\u2019s side, earned a PhD from <italic>Howard</italic> in America before returning to Ghana in 1937. After being briefly imprisoned for a seditious article, he moved to Lagos and launched <italic>West African Pilot</italic> magazine. Like his father, Azikiwe benefited from the British policy of recruiting chiefly heirs into elite clerk roles, missionaries selected the astute, less privileged Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana to become a teacher. With the aid of chiefly and miner relatives in Lagos, Nkrumah attended America universities, earning degrees from <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> and studying Marxism. \nThe promotion of local gentry was not limited to Europeans as Japanese governors also of Taiwan recruited and subsidized children of gentry for education. <italic>Lloyd</italic> India considered granting additional responsibilities to Indian staff in 1932, driven by economic pressures. However, significant promotions of Indian staff to executive positions occurred only in the early 1950s. In contrast, <italic>Mercantile Bank of India</italic>, influenced by <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Indian Partner Thomas Catto\u2019s 1936 suggestion, created a new grade of Indian Assistant by 1938. Despite concerns about the bank\u2019s British identity and executive staff mobility, emphasizing non-discrimination based on race in seeking \u2018<italic>well educated young men, preferably graduates, of good family</italic>...\u2019 \nLikewise, elite Indian families led the movement for independence over this time. After WWI, Rufus Isaacs became the first Jewish Viceroy of India, committed to the Government of India Act of 1919, which sought to increase Indian participation in governance despite opposition from British conservatives, and took a firm stand against racial discrimination. \nBalancing these responsibilities, he ordered the arrest of Mahatma Gandhi\u2014a British educated lawyer whose father and grandfather were PMs of a West Indian principality\u2014for sedition in 1922. Isaacs also faced uprisings, including the Moplah rebellion in 1921 and Sikh unrest in 1922. Since Robert Brand\u2019s cousin Thomas Freeman served as Governor of Bombay in 1913 and of Madras from 1919, he contended with Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s civil disobedience when he became Viceroy of India in 1931 and shaped the Government of India Act of 1935.\nSince acquisitions of the 1920s, Anglican Chair of <italic>Royal Mail </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> Owen Philipps struggled with mounting debts. In 1931, Philipps was convicted for issuing a misleading prospectus from 1926 and 1927 under the Larceny Act and served a twelve-month prison sentence. His case prompted reforms in corporate governance practices to prevent future financial misconduct. Amidst <italic>Royal Mail </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>\u2019s crisis, Unitarian <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> heir Richard Durning Holt\u2014and cousin of <italic>Huth</italic>\u2019s Meinertzhagen\u2014became Chair of <italic>Elder Dempster </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> and <italic>Glen Line</italic> and the Holt family\u2019s<italic> Ocean </italic><italic>Shipping</italic><italic> </italic>bought both in 1935.\nStill, cartels faced mounting pressures. As New York chocolate manufacturer<italic> Rockwood</italic> challenged the dominance of <italic>Elder Dempster </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> and UAC in West African lighterage services, as her complaint in 1935 led to a Colonial Office investigation, revealing the strong influence of these shipping firms. Although <italic>Rockwood</italic> secured reduced rates, the shipping cartel maintained discriminatory tariffs, preserving their control over the region\u2019s shipping. In 1937, European cocoa-buying firms in Ghana formed a price-fixing pool sparked resistance among local cocoa producers and brokers who withheld their crop from the market that season. The Colonial Office intervened later that year to suspend the pool and the crop holdup, responding to concerns about public order raised by the local colonial administration.\nWhile Asian trading companies like <italic>Finlay</italic>, <italic>Jardine</italic>, and <italic>Sassoon</italic> invested in East Africa, West African UAC had inherited a small Kenyan trading firm, she acquired another, specializing in farm equipment import in affiliation with <italic>Caterpillar</italic> in 1937. By 1939, UAC was the main supplier of British West African currency. Furthermore, negotiations with the Gold Coast government shifted customs duties and rail-freight charges from Accra to London, reducing transactions through West African banks to Britain. \nBritain allowed UAC to organize a cartel of six major firms\u2014known collectively as <italic>Association of West Africa Merchants</italic>\u2014to govern Nigeria\u2019s produce trade, set prices and market commodities with BBWA financing. Likewise, BFWA took over <italic>Banque Commerciale Africaine</italic> from <italic>Parisienne</italic> by 1941.  With the loss of her Far East colonies, Britain purchased all of Nigeria\u2019s cocoa, palm oil, rubber, cotton, and nut production, shifting from a neutral economic stance to controlling transportation, prices, wages, and export crop marketing.\nWithin this system, Nnamdi \u201cZik\u201d Azikiwe was denied a loan to buy a rubber plantation despite accounts at <italic>Nigerian Mercantile Bank</italic> and BBWA. Acquiring a small property bank in 1944 to fund his publishing enterprise, <italic>Zik Enterprises</italic>, he railed against colonial oppression of the British bank monopoly against Nigerians in books and <italic>West African Pilot</italic>. This spurred the nationalistic \u2018Zikists\u2019 for African-self-rule.\nAround that time, Joseph Stalin\u2019s 1937 Great Purge of <italic>Soviet Communist Party</italic> (\u201cSCP\u201d)<italic> </italic>leadership often replaced Gunzburg cousins and other Communist intellectuals with provincial antisemites. But after Germany invaded, Stalin organized the <italic>Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee</italic> under the direction of Shlomo \u201cMikhoels\u201d Vovsi to gain Jewish support domestically and from Britain as the unofficial head of Soviet Jewry. From a Latvian family claiming Biblical descent, Shlomo Vovsi had married daughter of a rabbi who founded the first Hebrew-language daily newspaper in Russia. Although he studied law, he became Artistic Director of Moscow\u2019s <italic>Yiddish Theater</italic> and a cousin of Miron Vovsi, Chief of Doctor of the Soviet Army.\nUpon occupying France, Germany spread Nazi ideology across the Maghreb. In Algeria, they revoked Muslim benefits, legalized antisemitism, and abolished the Algerian Jews\u2019 naturalization right granted in 1870. As Britain occupied Italian Libya, Benghazi Jews saw British capture as liberation with the death of Italian Libya\u2019s Governor Balbo. But with British withdrawal, Jews with French passports were expelled to German-occupied Tunisia, and thousands of Libyan Jews perished in European death camps or desert internment camps. \nWhile the British appointed Mohammed Jabari of Jamal Husayni\u2019s <italic>Palestine Arab Party</italic>\u2019s as Mayor of Hebron in 1940, Hitler allied with Jamal\u2019s brother, Mufti of Jerusalem Amin Husayni, by 1941. That year, Raghib Nashashibi\u2019s cousin, lieutenant, and would-be successor Fakhri Nashashibi was assassinated, likely by the Husaynis. With Amin as Commander of the Jihad militia, Antisemitism intensified across Arab lands, thousands of Jews were brutally killed and injured, and schools and synagogues were bombed. By 1944, Jabari joined <italic>Palestine Arab Party</italic>\u2019s Central Committee.\nMoreover, Amin Husayni aligned with oil rich Iraq on behalf of Germany. Since Husayni arrived in Baghdad in 1939, Rashid Gaylani became PM for a third time in 1940. Declining to sever ties with Italy, Gaylani sought Axis support and refused to allow British troops through Iraq. He resigned in January 1941, but led a coup in April, deposing the Hashimite Regent and replacing him with his cousin. While the British forced Gaylani out in May, his supporters fueled a pogrom against Jews spread in Baghdad as Gaylani fled to Germany. \nAmidst the violence, the Jewish Zilkha family fled Baghdad for America in 1941, where they founded <italic>American Nile Corp</italic> to finance trade among Europe, Latin America, and the Far East. Instead of Jews, Muslims moved into banking. The Shia Chalabi family and other prominent merchant families in Iraq built wealth through control of agriculture and trade since the 19th century. The Chalabi acquired villages around Mosul, profiting from cash crops produced by the peasants. \nBy the 1930s, the Chalabi owned large tracts of land and invested in agricultural industries, including dates, where government regulations favored larger producers. As his brother became Deputy for Baghdad in 1934. Muhammad studied in London and joined <italic>Agricultural </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Industrial Bank</italic> of Baghdad in 1938 as Assistant Director-General. until 1940. By 1941, the Chalabis co-founded <italic>Rafidain Bank</italic>. Resigning to become a director of <italic>Rafidan</italic>, Muhammad was appointed to the Board of <italic>Iraqi National Bank</italic> in 1948.\nAfter the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, Henri Curiel and other Marxists in Egypt increased their antifascist activities. Curiel, born in Cairo in 1914, to a second-generation Jewish banker who was a cousin- in-law of the Menasce and Cattui families. In 1942, British interference in Egyptian politics caused widespread dissatisfaction with the Wafd government, weakening the monarchy. \nThat year, Varl\u0131k Vergisi of 1942 targeted Jewish businesses to preference Muslims and, to a lesser extent, Christians. During this period, Curiel worked with Jewish Marxists to advocate for workers\u2019 rights and national liberation. Curiel\u2019s dedication to national and social liberation aligned with the growing nationalism and anti-imperialist sentiment in Egypt, prompting many to view communism as an alternative to British colonial rule.\nSince oil replaced coal, America had sufficient reserves, but allowed oil royalty tax-write offs to develop Saudi Arabia and Iran for Europe. As FDR agreed not to aid Israel, Saudi Arabia joined <italic>Texas Railroad Commission</italic> (\u201cTRC\u201d) to stabilize prices from 1945. Under the <italic>Bretton Woods</italic> agreement, Europe and Asia relinquished their colonies and entrusted their security to America through NATO in the West and bilateral treaties in the East. \nAnd along with absorbing the Sudan in 1946, Egypt gained independence from Britain under King Faruq of the Pasha Muhammad Ali dynasty. After the new government pressured aristocratic Coptics to sell their vast land, the Sarofim emigrated to America in 1946. Obtaining degrees from <italic>University of California</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business by 1954, Fayez Sarofim parlayed his father\u2019s funds to start what become the Southwest\u2019s largest investment advisor. \nBy 1948, <italic>Muslim Brotherhood</italic> had half a million members in Egypt, drawing mainly from poorer communities. Due to Egypt\u2019s increasing secularism, founder Hasan Banna attempted a coup. This attempt was interrupted by the end of the British Mandate and Israel\u2019s declaration of independence. Since Mohammed Jabari of Hebron was elected to the executive group of Jerusalem\u2019s <italic>Brotherhood</italic> in 1945, he headed Hebron\u2019s National and Emergency committees when UN passed its partition resolution in 1947. According to UN\u2019s partition plan, Arabs would receive 45%, with over half of the Israeli portion comprising desert. \nHowever, as Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Iraq invaded, the <italic>Arab-Israeli War of 1948 </italic>displaced approximately 750,000 Arabs from Palestine. As Jabari became the most prominent opposition leader to Amin Husayni\u2019s government, Egyptian PM Mahmoud Nuqrashi, responded to the coup attempt by banning <italic>Brotherhood</italic> in December 1948, seizing its assets, and arresting many members. After <italic>Brotherhood</italic> assassinated Nuqrashi, Banna was assassinated in February 1949. Despite these setbacks, <italic>Brotherhood</italic> continued to grow in influence across Egypt and neighboring countries. Fusing West Bank\u2019s fusion into Jordan, Jabari became a Jordanian senator in 1950.  From 1955, Jabari served as Minister of Agriculture, Justice, and Education.\nMeanwhile, Jews continued to lead Iraqi banking, industry, and society, comprising as much as 25% of the country\u2019s middle class, owning 75% of import companies and the largest transport firm. They were prominent in the Baghdad Chamber of Commerce\u2014holding 6 of 15 directorships in 1948\u2014and held key roles in finance and <italic>Iraqi</italic> RR. However the <italic>Arab-Israeli War </italic>intensified Ant-Semitism across Arab countries, including in Syria, Egypt, Libya), Morocco, and Iraq,which cut off oil to Israel, crippling Europe\u2019s refined oil. \nWhile Elias Sassoon joined Israel\u2019s government as an advisor and became Chair of <italic>Sassoon</italic> with a year, the Sephardi bank family<italic> Safra</italic> fled violence om Syria to Brazil. As the condition worsened, laws prevented Syrian Jews from selling property and froze their bank accounts. Confiscated Jewish property was given to Arab refugees. \nExcept for brief periods in the 1950s, emigration was banned. Some Jews who escaped to Lebanon were sent back to Syria, where they faced imprisonment, torture, and execution. While Jewish representation in business fell from 18% of company directors in 1951 to 5% by 1960 in Egypt, Christian Copts owned 75% of transport, 44% of industry, 51% of banks, and 34% of agricultural land, accounting for 15% of national wealth.\nIn the Soviet Union, following Nazi atrocities, Western Jews and <italic>Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee</italic> discussed documenting Nazi persecution of Soviet Jews and establishing a Jewish republic in Crimea. However, the burgeoning Cold War intensified Stalin\u2019s suspicions, especially concerning Western imperialist plots. Targeting Jewish intellectuals as \u2018cosmopolitan\u2019 interlocutors with Western capitalists, Stalin eradicated surviving Jewish institutions. \nAs Shlomo Vovsi was found dead in early 1948, the <italic>Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee</italic> and Yiddish theaters were disbanded as hundreds of women and children were deported to Siberia. In May 1948, the Soviets played a leading role in UN\u2019s recognition of Israel and in October, hosted Golda Meir, Israel\u2019s first ambassador to the Soviet Union, when she visited Moscow\u2019s synagogue. And during the <italic>Arab-Israeli War of 1948</italic>, the Soviet Union supported Israel while criticizing the Arabs.\nWhile <italic>Barclay</italic> served as the government banker in British Mandate Palestine, <italic>Anglo-Palestine Bank</italic>, renamed <italic>Bank Leumi</italic> in 1951, played a central role in managing Israel\u2019s finances and issuing currency. Concurrently, the Marxist <italic>Bank Hapoalim</italic>, the Recanati family\u2019s <italic>Israel Discount Bank</italic>, and private banks established by European immigrants operated in the expanding market. <italic>Bank of Israel</italic> started in late 1954, marking a shift in monetary policy management to a national institution. By 1955, Israel\u2019s banking sector had grown with the addition of cooperative credit societies, mortgage banks, and other financial entities, bolstering the country\u2019s economic stability and growth prospects.\nThe breakdown of imperialistic Middle Eastern colonies led to a sea of national border changes, often dealing with religion and energy. Since Italy and her German allies were expelled in 1942, Libya gained independence in 1947, and King Idris, whose family had was forced to cede decades of political and military power of eastern Libya in 1918 but retained spiritual influence, ascended the throne in 1951. \nIn South Asia, British <italic>Burma </italic>controlled oil in Burma and India since 1902. After the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, Pakistan received half of oil. While <italic>BANK</italic> funded an Indian dam until Pakistan sued India for over a decade, Caliph-in-law Nizam\u2019s Hyderabad was forcefully integrated into India in 1948 despite a preference for Pakistan. Since <italic>National Provincial</italic> acquired the colonial focused <italic>Grindlay</italic> in 1924, she transferred her interests to <italic>National Bank of</italic> <italic>India</italic>, while <italic>Grindlay</italic> retained her management and identity, and acquired <italic>Lloyd</italic> India several years later.\nMuhammad Jinnah became Pakistan\u2019s first Governor-General with his principal lieutenant, Liaquat Khan, as PM. Born to a wealthy Muslim merchant, Jinnah was a secularist and had married Rattanbai Petit, the daughter of an ennobled Parsee industrialist against his wishes. Rattanbai\u2019s sister later married co-religionist Sylla Tata, as did her daughter, to Neville Wadia, who had converted to Christianity. However, Jinnah soon died. \nThe scion of a Nawab of Dhaka, Khawaja Nazimuddin followed Jinnah until 1951, when he became PM upon Liaquat\u2019s assassination. By then Jawaharlal Nehru became India\u2019s PM, establishing a multi-generational political dynasty. While nationalizing airlines and other industries by 1953, Nehru appointed Sylla\u2019s brother to chair of <italic>Air India</italic> on top of his other <italic>Tata</italic> roles, including steel, electricity, chemicals, insurance, and hotels.\nIn Pakistan, capitalist families\u2014Adamjee, Ispahani, Habib, Rahimtoola, Dada, Arag, Valika, and Cowasjee\u2014belonged to quasi-caste commercial communities: Aga Khan-led Khoja Ismailis, Shia Khoja Isnasheris and Dawoodi Bohras, and Sunni Memon and Punjabi Sheikhs. These families were endogamous and maintained internal councils and organizations, which coordinated investment and business alliances. Most migrated to Pakistan after Partition in 1947. \nBack in 1932, members of the \u201cNew Muslim Majlis\u201d in Calcutta established the Muslim Chamber of Commerce, later led by an Ispahani. That year, <italic>Eastern Federal Insurance</italic> started with support from <italic>Ispahani</italic>, <italic>Adamjee</italic>, and <italic>Rahimtoola</italic> and later came under <italic>Arag</italic> and <italic>Ispahani</italic> management. In 1941, <italic>Habib</italic> established <italic>Habib Bank</italic> in Bombay and banked <italic>Muslim League </italic>and other funds. \nIn 1943, Jinnah encouraged <italic>Ispahani</italic>, <italic>Rahimtoola</italic>, and <italic>Rehman</italic> to form <italic>Federation of Muslim Chambers of Commerce & Industry</italic>, with Adamjee as President. At the request of Jinnah, <italic>Adamjee</italic> and <italic>Ispahani</italic> formed<italic> Orient Airways</italic> in 1946, without Hindu directors, and with Jinnah as a shareholder. Likewise, <italic>Habib</italic>, <italic>Dada</italic>, <italic>Arag</italic>, <italic>Adam</italic>, <italic>Valika</italic>, and <italic>Cowasjee</italic> formed <italic>Muhammadi Steamship</italic>, with Mahomedali Habib and Jinnah involvement. At Partition, <italic>Adamjee</italic> and <italic>Ispahani</italic> with founder-directors including <italic>Shahabuddin</italic>, <italic>Jute</italic>, and <italic>Arag</italic> formed<italic> Muslim Commercial Bank</italic>.\nAfter becoming a director of <italic>Imperial Bank of Persia</italic>, Edward Young took charge of the Finance Committee in 1940 and became Chair by 1945. A descendant of Francis Baring\u2019s brother, Young\u2019s uncle had married a Spencer-Churchill and his stepfather\u2019s cousin married <italic>Glyn</italic> cousin Isabel Lascelles Mills, related to the Cavendish and Brand families. Since his nephew married a Smyth descendant, whose cousin one removed married Weetman Pearson\u2019s son. He was also related to the Meinertzhagen, Smyth, Lloyd, and Mallet families. Serving in Parliament from 1915, Young advised governments in Africa, Asia, and Europe in the 1920s, and shifted to financial restructuring in London began from 1935, when he joined the boards of <italic>English Electric</italic>, <italic>Hudson\u2019s Bay Co</italic>, and <italic>Imperial Bank of Persia</italic> by 1937.  \n<italic>Imperial </italic>initially held the exclusive right to issue Iran\u2019s paper currency from its founding in 1889. Since the nationalization of <italic>Banque Russo-Asiatique</italic>, Soviet <italic>Narodny</italic> established <italic>Narodny</italic> Tehran by 1925. In 1928, the Iranian government established <italic>Iranian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>(\u201c<italic>Bank Melli</italic>\u201d) with participation from Persian Jewry to replace <italic>Imperial</italic>\u2019s note-issuing privilege and to serve as the country\u2019s state bank. By 1931, <italic>Imperial </italic>was forced to surrender her note-issuing rights, transferring monetary authority to <italic>Melli. </italic>\nAbol Ebtehaj was most famous Persian banker. Born in Rasht, Ebtehaj studied in Paris and Beirut before moving to Tehran and joining <italic>Imperial </italic>in 1920 as a junior clerk. He was promoted to Assistant Chief Interpreter in 1924 and to Assistant to the Chief Inspector in 1929. That year, Ebtehaj married Maryam Nabavi, connected with the Shah\u2019s Court and Soviet trade. He resigned from <italic>Imperial </italic>in 1936 due to lack of advancement for Persians and joined the Ministry of Finance. In 1942 he became Governor of <italic>Melli</italic><italic> </italic>and his brother co-founded <italic>Iranian Airways</italic>. While Ebtehaj was forced out of <italic>Melli</italic> in 1950, Iran split <italic>Melli</italic>, which remained the country\u2019s largest bank, and <italic>Bank Markazi</italic>, the central bank, in 1960.\nSince <italic>Eastern Bank</italic> opened in Bahrain in 1921, the British Arab Gulf had few banks. In 1941 amidst WWII, <italic>Imperial </italic>gained a banking monopoly in Kuwait. As Young became Chair of <italic>Imperial </italic>by 1945 for a decade, he renamed <italic>Imperial </italic>to <italic>British Bank of the Middle East </italic>(\u201cBBME\u201d), and director Edward Matheson, a <italic>Jardine</italic> cousin, opened branches. \nBBME gained monopolies in Dubai in 1946 and Oman two years later, and branched to Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and North Africa, operating across nearly 20 Arabian countries by 1960. While BBME withdraw from Iran amidst escalating tensions between the government and <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic><italic> </italic>over oil, Kuwait became her largest source of profit by 1950. By 1952, BBME\u2019s operations in Iran ceased, focusing instead on expanding its network in the Gulf and broader Middle East.\nSidney Pears joined BBME\u2019s Board in 1946 until 1970. He joined entered <italic>Cooper</italic> in 1919, following his father, who had served as a partner and Council member. He moved into wartime service in 1941 as Director of Contracts at the Ministry of Supply and in 1942 became Principal Controller of Costs, handling contract costing, Raw Materials Division accounts, and ROF audits. He became Senior Partner of <italic>Cooper</italic> in 1946. Although <italic>Cooper</italic><italic> </italic>did not typically interlock directorates, she made an exception to develop international relations.\nFrom 1955 to 1967, BBME\u2019s Board included Dallas Bernard. Related to the <italic>Jardine</italic> through his mother, Bernard wed the daughter of HSBC\u2019s Charles Addis. Bernard served as Managing Director of <italic>Jardine</italic> from 1922 to 1928 and was a member of the Hong Kong Executive and Legislative Councils from 1926 to 1928. He first chaired HSBC in 1924 and served on the London Committee of HSBC from 1929 to 1942 and again from 1960 to 1964. A BOE Director from 1936 to 1949, Bernard was Deputy Governor from 1949 to 1954. \nAfter Ebtehaj left BBME over blocked promotions, he implemented policies that harmed her interests as Governor of <italic>Melli</italic>. So, BBME eventually allowed local Arab and Indian mercantile heirs into positions of authority to mitigate risk and expand branches after 1945. BBME emphasized employing nationals in Kuwait, Dubai, and Oman. By 1961, Muscat\u2019s clerical staff included only four Omanis out of sixteen. In contrast, Bahrain had achieved a 50% local staff composition by the 1950s as <italic>Bahra</italic><italic>i</italic><italic>n</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>started in 1957, while Dubai\u2019s workforce was predominantly from the Trucial Coast. \nAs Gulf oil wealth surged, competition for local talent intensified. <italic>Dubai</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>opened in 1963 and, by 1964, Dubai faced heightened competition from other sectors, leading to a decrease in the proportion of national staff to 30%. Claude Loombe became Chair of BBME from 1967. Born into the Anglo-Greek Sechiari Ionides of Chios related to <italic>Ralli</italic>, Loombe joined <italic>Chartered Bank</italic> in 1925 and then a member of <italic>Kuwait Currency Board</italic>, <italic>Jordan Currency Board</italic>; <italic>Sudan Currency Board</italic>, and <italic>Libyan Currency Commission</italic>. \nSince BBME held a banking monopoly in the British protectorate Kuwait since her founding during WWII, economic control fueled discontent among the merchant class. In 1952, BBME refused a letter of guarantee to a Kuwaiti merchant, sparking outrage and a petition by Kuwaiti merchants to Emir Abdullah Sabah for a Kuwaiti-owned bank. The Emir authorized the creation of <italic>Kuwait National Bank</italic>, breaking BBME\u2019s monopoly as the Persian Gulf\u2019s first national and joint-stock bank as more followed and drove competition. While one member of the long established Bahar merchant family was a Chair of <italic>Kuwait National Bank</italic>, Abdul Bahar <italic>Commercial Bank of Kuwait</italic> and <italic>Central Bank of Kuwait</italic>. Bahar also collaborated with other prominent families and the government in establishing <italic>Kuwait Investment Co</italic> in 1961 and other development funds.\nWith the decline of the British Empire and rationalization of British companies, <italic>Mercantile Bank</italic> and BBME were insolvent. Since acquiring <italic>P&O Bank</italic> before WWII, HSBC\u2019s main rival, <italic>Chartered Bank</italic>, added the Eastern Bank and the Cyprus branches of <italic>Ionian Bank</italic> in 1957. HSBC became the largest foreign bank in many countries from the Far East to Southwest Asia as she established a large interest in BBME and renewed her connection with <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> by acquiring <italic>Mercantile Bank</italic> in 1959, which had strong connections to <italic>Yule Catto</italic>. \nWhen acquiring BBME, HSBC asked Sassoon-cousin Lawrence Kadoorie to resign as a director due to his being Jewish. As head of <italic>Chase International Ventures</italic> since 1958, Meyer co-founded <italic>Iran Development Bank</italic> with former-<italic>Chase</italic> VP and Chair of <italic>BANK</italic> Eugene Black Jr<italic>,</italic> followed by similar ventures in South Africa by 1960<italic> </italic>as <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and other American commercial banks branched overseas. \nIn British East Africa, meanwhile, marriage united disparate ethnicities and politics. Since migrating into Kiambu during the 19th century, Kikuyu families claimed land by clearing and cultivating it, often negotiating with the indigenous Wandorobo. Some Kikuyu families established large estates, including Magana in Ngenda. One of Magana\u2019s wives was a Maasai, and his daughter married a Maasai chief, with whom Magana\u2019s grandson, Jomo \u201cKenyatta\u201d Ngengi, spent time. \nKenyatta joined <italic>Kikuyu Central Association</italic> (\u201cKCA\u201d), he moved to London to lobby the British government regarding Kikuyu land grievances in 1929. Although married, he moved to London, later marrying Edna Clarke, a White Briton, in 1942. After the colonial government suppressed KCA, the ethnically diverse <italic>Kenya African Union</italic> (\u201cKAU\u201d) emerged, which Kenyatta joined upon his return to Kenya in 1946. He strengthened ties with Kikuyu elites by marrying the daughter of Senior Chief Koinange. Following her death, he married the aristocratic daughter of Chief Muhoho. \nAs the Mau Mau Uprising against British land policies escalated, Kenyatta\u2019s leadership came under scrutiny while radicals took over Kikuyu politics, and assassinated Senior Chief Waruhiu Kungu. While Evelyn Baring governed British South Africa since the 1940s, he became Governor of Kenya following the murder. With Kenyatta convicted and imprisoned, the escalating violence, Baring declared a state of emergency and appointed General George Erskine to lead military operations in East Africa. To address land policies, Baring focused on economic agricultural development and fostered Black farmers.\nSince America\u2019s State Department pressured Bolivia to limit German influence in its oil and tin industries during WWII, Bolivia\u2019s <italic>Revolutionary Nationalist Movement</italic> formed in 1942 to represent working-class and indigenous interests. Despite winning elections in 1951, military intervention led to the armed rebellion in 1952, followed by the expropriation and nationalization of tin mining, and agrarian reform by 1953. \nThe fervor infected Chile, where former military dictator Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez capitalized on anti-party sentiment, emphasizing his ability to address corruption and economic crises. Amidst Chilean hyperinflation in 1955, former <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris apprentice Augustin Edwards IV influenced the Chilean government to engage America\u2019s former Assistant Secretary of Commerce. Along with reducing copper profit taxes, Edwards commissioned a study to reform Chile\u2019s financial system. The resulting reforms stabilized the currency and spurred growth by 1956.\nWhile <italic>Bank of Syria & Lebanon</italic> oversaw finances since 1924, Lebanon\u2019s separation in 1948 split the bank and currency. As Syria formed <italic>Central Bank of Syria</italic>, a currency board took over Lebanon\u2019s currency. As Syria, enduring two military coups in 1949, Adib Shishakli orchestrated a final third one. By 1952, Akram Hawrani\u2019s mobilization of peasants and smaller landowners against larger feudal lords in central Syria culminated in securing Shishakli\u2019s endorsement for a state land distribution decree. As the war spurred many Arabas to flee Palestine for Lebanon, wealthy Egyptians, Syrians, and Iraqis frightened by the increasingly socialist policies of their own governments joined oil-rich Saudi princes to store wealth in Lebanon. \nSome of the Arabs fleeing to Beirut were the Beidas family. Since becoming Palestine\u2019s Deputy Secretary of Finance in 1946, Henri Beidas was named Head of the department established in Britain to wind up the Government of Palestine. Since rising to Head of<italic> Arab Bank</italic>, Henri\u2019s brother Yusuf opened an exchange and later ventured into an import-export business alongside other Arab financiers from Palestine. \nConvincing <italic>TransAmerica</italic> to come into his trade-financing operations, Yusuf Beidas founded <italic>Intra</italic> in 1951, becoming <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s correspondent, and branching to Syria, Iraq, Qatar, and Jordan. Also in 1951, Boutros Khouri and Khouri in-law Georges Maalouf founded <italic>Bank of Lebanon & Overseas </italic>to foster links with expatriates in Brazil with a branch in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Although Syrian Marxists assassinated Lebanon\u2019s PM Riad Solh in 1951, the extended Solh family continued to split control of Lebanon with several Sunni and Christian families.\nWhile gold trading activity in the Middle East became closely tied to the oil price, countries followed different path along the Persian Gulf. Before the 1950s, Saudi Arabia had no domestic banks, only branches of foreign banks offering Western-style services, including Dutch <italic>Saudi Hollandi</italic>, French <italic>Indochine</italic>, British BBME, <italic>Jordan Arab Bank</italic>, <italic>Bank of Lebanon & Overseas</italic>,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Pakistani</italic> <italic>National of Pakistan</italic>. The population relied on money-changing for financial needs due to religious concerns about interest-bearing transactions. \nThe discovery of oil and growing wealth led to a change. In 1952, the Kingdom adopted a more open banking policy and established <italic>Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency</italic> (\u201cSAMA\u201d). As <italic>Saudi</italic> <italic>National Commercial Bank</italic> and <italic>Riyad Bank</italic> domestic banks started, <italic>Chase</italic> developed a depository for SAMA, private banks, and royals, and <italic>Citi</italic> established a branch in 1955. A year after starting in 1957, <italic>Rajhi </italic>moneychangers began women-only branches.\nMeanwhile, Mohammed Laden transformed his company into one of the world\u2019s largest construction firms. Born in Hadhramaut, Yemen, he moved to Saudi Arabia in the 1930s and initially worked as a bricklayer. He started his own construction business and kinterlinked with the fellow Hadhrami Attas family of <italic>Saudi Hollandi</italic>. In the 1940s, he built palaces for members of the Saudi royal family. In 1951, he secured a contract to build a road between Jeddah and Medina after a British firm withdrew, which led to more contracts.\nAfter the 1949 armistice between Egypt and Israel, more Middle Eastern oil traveled through <italic>Suez Canal </italic>to Europe along the Straits of Tiran through to the Gulf of Aqaba. Initially, during ongoing hostilities, the legality of denying entry to enemy vessels and conducting search operations was upheld. However, post-armistice, Egypt continued exercising control, both at sea and from the shore, using batteries to enforce inspections. \nDespite discussions and assurances in 1950 regarding free passage through the straits, incidents like the detention of the British vessel <italic>Empire Roach</italic> in 1951 showcased Egypt\u2019s commitment to preventing contraband flow to Israel. The same year, Egypt re-confirmed <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic>\u2019s unofficial role as a central bank. Since Raphael Suar\u00e9s and Ernest Cassel established it in 1898, the bank served as the government\u2019s banker and issued notes alongside other private and foreign-owned banks. \nWhile <italic>Sassoon</italic>\u2019s Elias Sassoon negotiated and advising on diplomatic relations with Turkey and Egypt, the <italic>Korean War</italic> inflated Egyptian cotton, leading Arabic <italic>Mansour </italic>to start trading businesses. But when peace deflated prices, Egyptian riots started in 1952. Amidst corruption allegations, King Faruq struggled internally with the Wafd party and externally with British control. King Faruq was forced to abdicate in 1952 by the Free Officers\u2019 movement. \nAs Faruq\u2019s infant son remained nominally on the throne under a regency, <italic>Sassoon</italic> and <italic>Cattaui</italic> created <italic>Bank of Cairo</italic>. By June 1953, Egypt abolished the monarchy and the Marxist military officer Gamal Nasser seized power. A month after Egypt\u2019s king lost his throne, Jordan\u2019s Parliament ousted the ailing King Talal in favor of his son, and Bechara Khouri resigned as Lebanon\u2019s President a month later, amid public discontent over allegations of nepotism and corruption.\nThe <italic>Panic of 1948</italic> spurred investment in African oil. Before Portugal founded an oil company in Angola in 1953, <italic>Gulf Oil</italic> and <italic>Royal Dutch Shell</italic> founded companies in Tunisia by 1950. Since France\u2019s state monopoly had relied on Iraqi oil, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris interests bought <italic>Transafricaine</italic> in 1948, merging <italic>Co Coloniale Commerciale et Industrielle</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Africaine de Transports Tropicaux</italic> to dominate oil transport in Guinea, Ivory Coast, and Chad. But while oil soon gushed in Algeria and elsewhere, European investment in Africa remained relatively limited. \nThe first wave of investment focused domestically. After the discovery of the Parentis field in 1954 and the liberalization of petroleum regulations, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Shell</italic>, and <italic>OIL</italic> founded FINAREP to finance oil exploration. In 1955, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Worms</italic>, and <italic>Comptoir</italic> created COFIREP as a rival venture.\nFollowing oil inflation from Egypt\u2019s closure of <italic>Suez</italic> <italic>Canal</italic> in the <italic>Panic of 1956</italic>, France accelerated domestic and African oil and mining projects. In 1957, <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris founded COFIMER to fund resource extraction in the Franc Zone, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris founded <italic>French Petroleum Investment Co</italic> to consolidate control over energy and raw material investments, and EURAFREP, controlled by <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, Indochine, BGGE, with <italic>Solvay</italic>\u2019s Ren\u00e9 Bo\u00ebl as a director, began operations in Saharan oil exploitation.\nWith the nationalization of <italic>Suez Canal</italic>, <italic>Suez</italic>, operating the canal since 1869, lost her purpose but maintained reserves of net profits, invested in financial markets. Along with transit rights from 1956, <italic>Suez</italic><italic> </italic>received compensation from Egypt after 1960. Using her foreign currency reserves, <italic>Suez</italic> provided loans, including financing the first sale of a Caravelle aircraft abroad to Finland through <italic>Lyonnais</italic>. Jacques Georges-Picot served as President and led the company into real estate and industrial investments. Georges-Picot\u2019s uncle had negotiated the Sykes-Picot Agreement with the British to split the Ottoman Empire during WWI. His cousin was married to Edmond Estaing, former Chair of the <italic>Homberg</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris-founded <italic>French & Colonial</italic> HC. In 1952, Estaing\u2019s son married a granddaughter of Eugene Schneider.\nAfrican minerals also helped rebuild and feed Europe. In 1952, <italic>Mauritania Iron Mines Co</italic> started, with <italic>Parisenne</italic> and other French bankers controlling 50.5% of the company. British and Canadian interests held the remaining 49.5%, and a large stake by <italic>British Iron Steel</italic> and <italic>Frobisher </italic>of Canada, the latter having with deposits in Southern Rhodesia and British Guinea. In 1956, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 Georges Pompidou partnered <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Navale de l</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Ouest</italic>, with <italic>Pechiney</italic> to support ALUCAM\u2019s aluminum plant in Ed\u00e9a. \nFrench investments extended to West Africa with <italic>Colonial Society of Cements</italic> out of Marseilles. And to drill for Moroccan phosphates and Algerian iron, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Credit Industriel</italic>, <italic>Suez</italic>, and other French banks invested in <italic>Mokta </italic>and<italic> Gafsa</italic>. <italic>Parisienne</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Eugene Mirabaud was Chair of <italic>Alg\u00e9rienne</italic> and <italic>Gafsa</italic>. In sub-Saharan Africa, <italic>Paribas</italic> allied with technological trading company <italic>Optorg</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Commerciale du Haut-Ogoou\u00e9</italic> and <italic>Peyrissac</italic>, adding Durand-R\u00e9ville and Chavanel of Bordeaux to the Board from the latter. \nAlong with serving Soviet interests in France, <italic>Seligman</italic> Paris\u2019 Managing Director Nicolas Kagan collaborated with railway engineer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic>, engaging in projects in India, Turkey, Algeria, Madagascar, Djibouti, Ivory Coast, Egypt, Congo, Guadeloupe, Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. He created forest exploitation companies in Cameroon and Gabon, where he also directed companies backed by state credit and <italic>French Co of Gabon</italic>. While Kagan engaged in Yugoslavia and other international projects, he withdrew from  <italic>Batignolles</italic> by the early 1950s. Kinterlinked since the 1920s, <italic>Batignolles</italic><italic> </italic>reinforced relations with <italic>Lazard</italic> as a descendant of <italic>Batignolles</italic>\u2019 founder Ernest Go\u00fcin married Pierre Weill\u2019s daughter in 1958.\nMeanwhile, de-colonization proceeded in British West Africa. Since Nigeria established <italic>Nigerian National Bank</italic> in 1933 after the failure of <italic>Industrial </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Commercial Bank</italic> and <italic>Nigerian Mercantile Bank</italic>, four banks were founded between 1945 and 1947, including <italic>African Continental Bank</italic> and <italic>Agbonmagbe Bank</italic>. \nSoon establishing correspondent relationships with <italic>National Westminster Bank</italic>, <italic>Agbonmagbe</italic> operated branches in Ebute-Meta, Mushin, Ifo, Abeokuta, Sagamu, and Ago-Iwoye, serving traders transporting nuts, cattle, and timber. <italic>Agbonmagbe</italic> was managed and partly owned by Chief Matthew Okupe. Since his father served of the ruling house of Ijebu-Remo, Matthew began trading by 1930 and inherited the Chiefdom in 1938.  \nIn 1947, the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons protested in London, triggering a constitutional review. By 1948, Azikiwe renamed his bank <italic>African Continental Bank</italic> and campaigned it as a Nigerian-owned development tool to promote savings. Amidst the banking boom, there were about a dozen such indigenous banks by 1950 with over sixty branches, including the only surviving pre-WWI indigenous bank, <italic>Nigerian National Bank</italic>.\nWhile marketing service over profits, he used <italic>African Continental Bank</italic> to finance <italic>Zik Enterprises</italic>, which grew to include a dozen companies, including <italic>African Continental Bank</italic> and his publishing business, including <italic>African Book Co</italic>, <italic>Nigerian Paper Co</italic>, and <italic>Nigerian Printing Supply Co</italic>. As speculative indigenous banks mushroomed amidst post-WWII inflation, colonial officials sought to stabilize prices in 1949 by forming <italic>Commodity Marketing Board</italic>\u2014to simulate the stabilizing role of <italic>Barclay</italic> and BBWA did before WWII\u2014to guarantee prices with statutory agents buying key agricultural exports from producers at fixed prices for export. As price soared, so did <italic>Commodity Marketing Boar</italic><italic>d</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>excess account, which were invested in low-yielding <italic>Exchequer</italic> debt.\nAmidst ruinous competition from 1949, <italic>Zik Enterprises</italic> suffered heavy losses. On the newspaper front, <italic>West African Pilot</italic> flailed against the British-owned <italic>Daily Times</italic> and <italic>Daily Service</italic>, controlled by Azikiwe\u2019s political opponents. And on the banking front, over two dozen indigenous bank formed. By 1951, a new constitution permitted the appointment of African ministers in both regional and central governments. \nRather than nationalize banks, Nigeria\u2019s Banking Ordinance of 1952 required federal licenses within two years. While British banks gained licenses, even BOE doubted that any indigenous banks could operate profitability under the regulations in the competitive environment as over a dozen failed.<italic> </italic><italic>African Continental Bank</italic> was denied a license due to inadequate liquidity in 1953. \nAs Nigeria\u2019s government federalized in 1954, the Cameroons succeeded in the South while the leaders of the major political parties assumed roles as regional premiers: Alhaji Ahmadu in the North, Obafemi Awolowo in the West, and Nnamdi Azikiwe in the East. Like Azikiwe, the premiers descended from pre-colonial royalty. While Ahmadu traced his lineage to the founder of the Fulani empire, Awolowo descended from chiefs and married a businesswoman with a similarly prestigious lineage. Regionalizing the <italic>Commodity Marketing Boards</italic>, the new regime authorized the regions to provide development grants. \nWhile Azikiwe resigned from his directorships in 1954, he convinced the Eastern Board to invest in<italic> African Continental Bank</italic>, gaining majority ownership. While Nigeria favored nationalizing indigenous banks, the British colonial administration and allies focused on investigating Azikiwe rather than train Nigerian bankers to compete with British banks. Likewise, the Western Board invested in <italic>Nigerian National Bank</italic> and deposited funds into <italic>Agbonmagbe Bank</italic>. While Chief Okupe, founder of <italic>Agbonmagbe</italic>, became Chair of <italic>Action Group</italic> in Ijebu-Remo Division, <italic>Action Group</italic> invested in <italic>Merchants Bank</italic> \nPossibly due to the crisis, a year later, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Barclay</italic>, and <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> formed South Africa\u2019s first merchant bank, <italic>Union Acceptances</italic>, which dominated the money market until the 1970s. However, BFWA lost her issuing privileges in sub-Saharan Africa in 1955. France then oversaw the transfer of BFWA shares to a consortium including <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic>, <italic>Alg\u00e9rienne</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, and <italic>Union Europ\u00e9enne Industrielle</italic>. \nIn 1954, DOJ urged desegregation to aid foreign policy since the Court had condoned \u2018separate but equal\u2019 for Black Americans in 1896. As the Court desegrated public schools in 1954, Congress reformed civil rights. As Michael Vaughan continued banking in Lagos, his cousins included Nigeria\u2019s Chief Justice. The American branch of the trans-Atlantic trade Vaughn cousins included Eugene Dibble III, who graduated <italic>Tuskegee</italic> in 1952, served as a munitions and demolition officer in the Air Force, and became a NYSE broker with <italic>Strauss Blosser MacDowell</italic> in 1955 until co-founding <italic>Astro Investment Co</italic> in 1965 to promote Black American economic influence. Dibble ventured into politics, serving as the Republican candidate for Water Commissioner for the City of Chicago in 1966. \nAmidst Stalin\u2019s involvement in the Korean conflict in 1950 and growing Cold War tensions, internal capitalism and dissent were accelerated. Descended from one of Bulgaria\u2019s foremost bankers, Atanas Burov was born married the sister-in-law of entrepreneur Todor Gubidelnikov, newspaper editor, and other People\u2019s Party members. Surviving public opposition to Bulgaria\u2019s alignment with Nazi Germany, Burov served as a minister in 1944 for five days until Communists took over. Burov was placed under house arrest and later imprisoned with other politicians. In 1945, a people\u2019s court sentenced him to a year in prison and two years of forced labor. \nIn 1952, Bulgarian capitalist political leadership underwent significant purges. In Sofia, trials focused on alleged espionage by mining engineers, notably led by Burov and Gubidelnikov. Despite being nearly 78 years old, Atanas Burov was falsely accused of plotting against the state from 1944 to 1947. The trials concluded in September 1953, with Burov receiving a death sentence and others like Simeon Burov and others sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Atanas was sentenced to 20 years in prison but died in 1954.\nAlso in 1952, Soviet authorities designated Israel as an agent of American imperialism in the Middle East and linked support for Israel to CIA espionage. That year, Czechoslovakia tried 14 defendants, including the Jewish Rudolf Slansky, for charges of Trotskyist, Titoist, Zionist, and bourgeois-nationalist treason. He was executed along with 10 others. In December 1952, Poland expelled her Israeli envoy but maintained diplomatic relations. Likewise, Soviet policy turned hostile toward Israel and domestic antisemitism escalated. \nIn 1952, Miron Vovsi and the few Jews remaining in theater, banks, academia, and other government institutions were arrested and tortured to confess the \u2018doctors\u2019 plot\u2019. By January 1953, hundreds of Yiddish writers and cultural figures were executed for plotting to poison senior officials, make the Crimea a Jewish territory, and then hand it over to the British and Americans. As Jews in Moscow, Leningrad, and cities across the former <italic>Pale</italic> were forced to burn their Yiddish books, terror engulfed even the Sephardi of Georgia as rumors swelled that soon all Jews would be rounded up. \nThe following month, the Soviet Union severed ties with Israel to justify internal policies, portraying Israel as an enemy. With Stalin\u2019s death in March, the government admitted that Stalin had ordered the KGB hit on Shlomo Vovsi in 1948, denounced the \u2018doctors\u2019 plot\u2019 as a hoax, and ordered an end to harsh treatment of prisoners. While discrimination against Jewish life, civil bias, and limited opportunities in universities, SCP developed a pro-Arab policy from 1954.\nWhen India nationalized <italic>Imperial Bank</italic> of 1921 into <italic>State Bank of India</italic> in 1955, while allowing most of the country\u2019s credit system to remain private, <italic>BANK</italic> funded new development banks, like <italic>Industrial Credit & Investment Corp of India</italic> (\u201cICICI\u201d), as a collaborative effort between with the newly independent Indian government with support from IMF and other multilateral development initiatives. Likewise, the British military withdrew from Iraq after thirty-five years of occupation. \nFrom 1954, Nasser centralized power in Egypt. Under Nasser\u2019s influence, a Sunni <italic>fatwa</italic> ended centuries of teachings that Shia, Alawais, and Druze were heretics and idolaters, allowing them into mainstream Islam. While Nasser promoted Marxist Pan-Arabism against Western imperialism under his personal banner, Syrian Christian Michel Aflaq fused these goals into <italic>Arab Socialist Baath Party</italic>. As a coup ousted Shishakli in Syria that year, <italic>Baath </italic>and Nasserist civilians established a government, but the military retained power. Although France granted independence to Tunisia under continuing rule of descendants of the Beys in 1956, revolutionaries exiled the king and proclaimed an Arab republic.\nWhile Nasser narrowly interpretated Egypt\u2019s armistice with Israel and fired upon British vessels in 1955, Israel protested to UN. Since the Soviets supported Nasser with Czechoslovak arms to challenge Israel in June, America and Britain sought to a peaceful resolution by funding development of the <italic>Aswan Dam</italic> via <italic>BANK</italic> by December. But as Egypt and Syria signed a defense treaty, At the same time, between Egypt and Syria, Israel attacked Syria to disrupt the burgeoning alliance, but instead solidified Arab cooperation. As Nasser grew increasingly belligerent, <italic>BANK</italic> paused<italic> Aswan Dam</italic> funds by April 1956.\nThe dam and the politics also spurred dissent in the Sudan. Since fusing into Egypt in 1946, the Sudan saw the emergence of rival factions, all of whom claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad. While Ismail Azhari\u2019s maternal lineage traced back to Ismail Kurdufani, a saintly cleric in Sudan, and his grandfather Abdallahi, who descended from the 17th century religious teacher Bishara Gharbawi. On his paternal side, Ismail\u2019s was related to an Islamic jurist, mufti of the Sudan, and head of the Tarika Ismailia, a prominent religious sect of the country. \nAfter WWI, Ismail married the daughter of an Egyptian with mixed Levantine and Turkish heritage, who served as a money changing sarraf from 1915 in Atbara and grew cotton after retirement. Abd Rahman was the posthumous son on Muhammad Ahmad, who had proclaimed himself the Mahdi, a messianic figure that would establish a just and Islamic society before the Day of Judgment. And Ali Mirghani claimed questionable descent from one of one of the twelve Imans.\nAs Egypt and Britain engaged in talks over the Sudan\u2019s status in 1952, Azhari\u2019s <italic>Unionists</italic> advocating for union with Egypt to influence British decisions. In contrast, Rahman\u2019s <italic>Umma</italic> party cooperated with the Sudanese government, strategically aligning against Egypt while pushing the British towards a negotiated departure. Various tribal and religious leaders, such as Mirghani, saw nominal \u2018Union\u2019 to counter Mahdist monarchy and Egyptian imperialism. A key point of contention were the Nile waters, which were set under British colonialism to favor Egypt rather than irrigate the dry Sudan. Resistant to compromise, Nasser saw the Sudan as a part of Egypt. Britain, however, preferred an approach to also benefit downstream countries.\nWhen Azhari became PM, Sudan declared independence to become Africa\u2019s largest country from late 1955. This decision was influenced by concerns about Egypt\u2019s political direction under Nasser, including the possibility of violence in Egypt and uncertainties surrounding British bases in the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> zone. Despite proposals for a <italic>Nile Valley Authority</italic> involving multiple riverain states and direct negotiations between Egypt and Sudan, mediated by neutral parties, no solution emerged. Within months, Rahman and Mirghani joined to oust Azhari in favor of Army officer Abd Khalil as PM. Likewise, the grandson of the last Sultan of Darfur, Mamoun Beheiry was the Chair of <italic>Sudan Currency Board</italic> from 1956 to 1958 and the first Governor of <italic>Bank of Sudan</italic> from 1958 to 1963, hiring much of <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic>\u2019s Sudanese staff.\nCornered, Nasser soon saw what he perceived as weakness. In June, a landslide damaged New York\u2019s <italic>Niagara Falls</italic> hydroelectric station, leading steel laborers to strike and Eisenhower to approve a record pay hike. While TBTA\u2019s Moses got public approval to develop the Saint-Lawrence River he sought for decades, Richberg linked labor unions to Marxism. While some countries instituted compulsory arbitration\u2014along with New York and Pennsylvania PUs\u2014America only started in the 1960s.\nAlso in June 1956, Golda Meir became Israel\u2019s Foreign Minister Israel. While Meir rose on her individual merit, she preceded female leaders that were part of elite political dynasties, including Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Indira Nehru, and Isabel Peron. Seeing an opportunity, Nasser accused <italic>BANK </italic>of breaking her contact, and nationalized <italic>Suez</italic> <italic>Canal</italic> by October, cutting off the Tiran Straits to Israeli trade and European imports of Middle Eastern oil. To protect their assets and restore oil flow along <italic>Suez</italic> <italic>Canal</italic>, Europe\u2019s army to responded in the <italic>Sinai War</italic>. As anti-British feelings spread across the Middle East, depositors ran from <italic>British </italic><italic>Bank of the Middle East</italic>. The same month<italic>, </italic>Hungary revolted against Soviet hegemony, but the movement was suppressed with tanks within two weeks.\nWhile Egypt re-confirmed <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic>\u2019s unofficial role as a central bank in 1957, the Soviets supplied Syria with warplanes and soon financed <italic>Aswan Dam</italic> construction. After refusing to contact with Jewish-owned <italic>Palestine Electric Co</italic> for decades, the Palestinian West Bank city of Nablus established a municipally-owned PU in 1957. Moreover, President Eisenhower, AEC Chair Lewis Strauss-Darmstadt, and Britain\u2019s Lord Rothschild sought to build nuclear power in the Middle East. \nBut as Syria and Egypt unified as United Arab Republic in February 1958, they disrupted regional dynamics. Internal dissent grew from Lebanon to Iraq, where Brigadier Abd Qasim\u2019s military coup executed the Shia King Faysal II, Crown Prince, and PM in July. Alarmed by Soviet expansion in the Middle East, America\u2019s President Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles sent Marines to prop up Lebanon\u2019s President Camille Chamoun\u2014who held on to power against a constitutional ban, enraging Muslims\u2014the day after Iraq\u2019s coup to prevent Nasser-inspired nationalist uprisings. \nWhile Hashemite rule in Iraq ended, Faysal\u2019s brother Abdallah and his descendants continued to rule Jordan. As Qasim grew closer to the Soviet Union and Iraqi communists, Dulles had CIA back a six-man team, which included Saddam Hussein, to assassinate Qasim in 1959. While the plot failed, Qasim\u2019s regime curbed <italic>Baath</italic> and weakened the local Communist Party, military officers gained influence in labor unions and the political landscape, with civilian power declining.\nThe Marxist revolutions were global. While Indonesia nationalized <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s oil in 1957, Fidel Castro took over Cuba by 1959, the Soviets aided Egypt, mineral-rich Ghana, and others following the <italic>Sinai War</italic> and recession. As in the Arab realm, calls for Pan African socialism grew, with the most militant coming from Ghana\u2019s first PM Kwame Nkrumah. As Nkrumah supported democracy, Congress and Israel financed her. But soon over a dozen countries gained independence in Africa alone. \nSince starting <italic>Jubilee Insurance</italic> for loans to lower- and middle-income families in 1936, the Shia Ismaili Aga Khan formed <italic>Diamond Jubilee Investment Trust </italic>in 1946 to finance construction and expanded into sectors like textiles and cotton farming. After Aga Khan IV took over in 1957, <italic>Industrial Promotion Services</italic> formed to invest in local businesses. <italic>Diamond </italic>thrived in Kenya, but faced challenges in Uganda and Tanzania under socialist regimes. While British banks offered inadequate credit for large-scale investments, new Indian and Dutch banks spurred Indian enterprises in East Africa. \nFor example, <italic>Bank of Baroda </italic>offered seven times more credit than <italic>Standard Bank</italic> to the Chandaria business group for expanding <italic>Kenya </italic><italic>Aluminum</italic><italic> Works</italic> in the early 1950s. Unlike the centralized elite leadership of Ismaili Muslims, non-Hindu Jain Indians rejected caste. Still, within the Hindu context, the Jains\u2019 multi-generational practice of commerce has made them part of the mercantile <italic>bania</italic> caste. In Kenya, the wealthy caste-like Oshwals mostly ran small businesses, such as second-hand shops in Ruiru. A few like, the Ranmal family built industrial textiles in Kenya and India. Retiring as Governor of Kenya in 1959, Evelyn Baring became head of Britain\u2019s international development arm, <italic>Commonwealth Development Corp</italic>.\nLikewise, Eisenhower promoted Dillon under the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs to unify foreign aid policies and to re-negotiate the <italic>General Agreement on Tariffs & Trade</italic> (\u201cGATT\u201d) in 1959. Moreover, Congress promoted North American trade with import quotas on overseas oil, subsidizing independent refiners at the cost of integrated majors. As America paid above market prices, Saudi Arabia cartelized producers into <italic>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</italic> (\u201cOPEC\u201d). \nSince the <italic>Suez Crisis </italic>of 1957 necessitated longer sea routes, Western oil companies looked for more stable sources to develop oil for Europe. In 1956, 82% of Western Europe\u2019s oil came from the Middle East, which decreased to 60% by 1966, while Libya\u2019s contribution rose to 25%. Japan\u2019s reliance on Middle Eastern oil increased from 80% in 1956 to 90% in 1966. With the discovery of oil in the Abu Dhabi Emirate in 1958, exports began in 1962. While <italic>British Petroleum </italic>and <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles</italic> formed  <italic>Abu Dhabi Marine </italic>as a JV to exploit offshore oil, <italic>Shell</italic> and other companies formed <italic>Abu Dhabi Petroleum </italic>for mainland oil.\nHowever, crisis continued in the apartheid states. Following police killed protestors the Sharpeville massacre in 1960, South Africa imprisoned members of the <italic>African National Congress</italic> (\u201cANC\u201d) and <italic>South African Communist Party</italic>. The crisis quickly spread. Opposing Communism in the Belgian Congo, Mobutu Sese Seko of colonial armed forces arrested political rivals and expelled Soviet advisers by 1960. In 1961, protests sparked the Angolan War of Independence against Portugal. \nAmong the freedom fighters who ended apartheid in southern Africa were Katz-descendants. While her brother was exiled to Siberia during the <italic>Russian Revolution</italic>, Tanya Katz and her husband immigrated to South Africa in 1928, opening a garment factory. As their daughter Ethel studied in Britain, their son Jack joined the military wing of the illegal ANC and <italic>South African Communist Party</italic> in 1960. Upon his imprisonment, Ethel returned and was briefly arrested herself. With Jack imprisoned in Pretoria<italic> </italic>for over a decade, Ethel dedicated the rest of her life to ending apartheid without ever having children. \nTo counter capital outflows and protect FX reserves, South Africa tightened FX controls. These measures created \u201cblocked <italic>rand</italic>\u201d accounts for non-residents selling South African securities, restricting the repatriation of their proceeds. Investors could only reinvest blocked <italic>rand</italic> in specific securities, such as government and municipal bonds, with limited options for future remittance. The blocked <italic>rand</italic> traded at a consistent discount to the official <italic>rand</italic> rate, driven by low demand and limited convertibility. \nWhile South Africa had severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in 1957, the Soviet Union agreed to sell her diamond supply to <italic>DeBeers</italic>. After the massacre in 1960, Moscow repudiated the deal. Despite announcing that the deal had ended, the parties integrated Soviet diamonds into the <italic>DeBeers</italic> cartel via secret channels through <italic>Hambro</italic> and <italic>Consolidated Gems</italic>. After <italic>Hill Higginson</italic> and <italic>Union Acceptances</italic> underwrote a consortium\u2019s acquisition of South Africa\u2019s sugar monopoly in 1962,   Ghana\u2019s Nkrumah cited the deal as evidence of Marxian financial concentration and imperialist expansion.\nIndependence also spread in French Africa. French efforts to establish a federal organization in its African territories faltered, leading to a wave of independence declarations after the 1958 constitutional referendum. While Tunisia and Morocco negotiated their independence in the 1950s, Algeria\u2019s decolonization was protracted and violent, culminating in independence after a bitter conflict from 1954 to 1962. Despite the formal end of French colonial rule in 1962, the legacy of these relationships continues to influence France\u2019s ties with her former African colonies.\nLikewise, management transitioned to connected local elites. Since 1902, when Hussam Okoya Thomas became CFAO\u2019s first Nigerian staff member and remained for 52 years, he served as the first Baba Adinni of Furabay Mosque, Olowogbowo, Lagos, and his wife was the Otun Iya Adinni of Idita Mosque. Their son Molade joined CFAO after studying accounting in England. In 1963, he became co-manager of the General Import Department, succeeding an expatriate. In 1972, he was appointed Director of External Relations, and in 1974, he took on the role of Director of Personnel.\nFrance\u2019s SAFRAP, led by General Gaulle\u2019s former Minister of Armed Forces Pierre Guillaumat, controlled 7% of Nigeria\u2019s oil production by 1962. SAFRAP may have hired Jake Simmons. A great-grandson of the first black chief of a Native American tribe, Simmons secured oil leases for black landowners in Oklahoma and Texas. By the mid-1960s, Simmons expanded into postcolonial Africa to diversify away from Arab production, negotiating deals with leaders like Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Nigerian officials. \nOther investors needed no introduction. Investing into the nearly bankrupt <italic>Occidental Petroleum</italic> as a tax shelter in 1957, Armand Hammer grew it into a conglomerate. In the early 1920s, Hammer had traded wheat with Lenin for treasures, mansions, and mines until Stalin expropriated private business in 1930. While he sold off Russian art and forgeries at bargain prices at <italic>Marshall Fields</italic>, he was friendly with world leaders ranging from Britain\u2019s Queen Mother to the Soviet directorate. \nAs Libya sought to increase state revenues but lacked capital and technical expertise, King Idris negotiated with Armond Hammer\u2019s <italic>Occidental</italic>. By 1966, <italic>Occidental </italic>discovered a billion-barrel oilfield in Libya and became one of the world\u2019s largest oil companies. However, oil-drilling rights disputes and Nasserist propaganda weakened Libya\u2019s monarchy. \nWith the adoption of the 1958 French Constitution, Ivory Coast, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal agreed to monetary integration in 1959. Mali initially tried to establish its own currency but later joined the revised <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic>. Along with non-member French Guinea, the states gained independence from France in 1960 and formed <italic>West African Monetary Union </italic>in 1962 to align currency issuance, FX reserves, and monetary policy.\nInternational banks similarly restructured activities. In 1957, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> provided capital for the new <italic>Banco Comercial de Angola</italic>. In 1962, three affiliated banks continued <italic>Nationale</italic>\u2019s activities across the newly independent Cameroon, Senegal, and Ivory Coast. After his Baoule family led Ivory Coast for generations, Felix Houphouet-Boigny continued guiding Africa\u2019s relationship with France as President from 1960. While Houphouet-Boigny reigned supreme, the country\u2019s capitalist and political class formed out of descendants of Ivorian pre-colonial chiefs and princes who intermarried and partnered in banking, agroindustry, and construction into the 21st century.\nAristocracy also prevailed in Burundi and Rwanda. Centuries ago, Tutsi migrated to the region, blending with the Hutus. Rwanda\u2019s monarchy structured a hierarchy (buhake), where Tutsi, associated with cattle herding and elite status, held prominence, while the Hutu focused on agriculture. This religiously anchored system created dependence, leading Hutus to rely on Tutsi for protection and cattle, intensifying social disparities. \nSince Germany\u2019s colonized Rwanda-Burundi in the late 19th century, Belgium took over administration with <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Belgian </italic><italic>Congo</italic> absorbing German banks and extending into Rwanda-Burundi during WWI before <italic>League of Nations</italic> formalized the mandate 1923. Belgian colonists sustained Tutsi supremacy for indirect governance. After WWII, <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Belgian </italic><italic>Congo</italic> became <italic>Central Bank of Belgian Congo & Ruanda-Urundi</italic> in 1951. Following the abolition of buhake in 1952, conflicts over cattle contracts exacerbated discontent among Hutu peasants over Tutsi dominance, leading to revolution in 1959. \nAs <italic>Central Bank of Belgian Congo & Ruanda-Urundi</italic> separated into currency issuing boards for independent central banks in 1960, <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> created<italic> </italic><italic>Banque Belgo-Africaine du Burundi</italic> from her <italic>Banque Belge d\u2019Afrique</italic> branches and <italic>Lambert</italic>, <italic>Nationale</italic>, <italic>Bank of America</italic>, and <italic>Generali </italic>of Trieste co-founded <italic>Banque </italic><italic>A</italic><italic>fricaine </italic><italic>I</italic><italic>nternationale </italic>and <italic>Banque du Ruanda-Urundi</italic> in Usumbura. However, Hutus overthrew the Rwanda king and established a Hutu-controlled republic in the name of progress and democracy by 1961. After Rwanda and Burundi split in 1962, <italic>Banque Commerciale du Ruanda</italic> was established in Kigali and <italic>Banque du Ruanda-Urundi</italic> became <italic>Banque Commerciale du Burundi</italic>, headquartered in Bujumbura.\nBy 1961, Kenya released Jomo Kenyatta from prison, leading to his appointment as Kenya\u2019s first PM in 1963 and President in 1964. Over the following decades, the Kenyatta family gained significant land, processing, and banking wealth. While the Sultanate of Zanzibar had controlled Mombasa within Kenya since 1895, the Sultanate gained independence in 1963. After a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat ended Sultan Jamshid\u2019s rule in early 1964, Zanzibar merged with Tanganyika to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, later renamed Tanzania, under the rule of Tanganyika\u2019s former president Julius Nyerere for the next two decades. \nFrom 1960, new expatriate banks entered Nigeria, including American <italic>Citi</italic> and <italic>Chase</italic>, one Indian, one Arab, and one French institution. In 1961, <italic>United Bank for Africa</italic> and <italic>Barini</italic> began operations as fully foreign-owned banks, while <italic>Bank of the North</italic>, controlled by the Government of Northern Nigeria, and <italic>Bank of Lagos</italic> had mixed ownership. With interests in <italic>United Bank of Africa</italic> and <italic>Liberian Trading & Development Bank</italic>, <italic>Bankers </italic><italic>Trust</italic> sought to expand in Ivory Coast, Senegal, Cameroon, and Congo, with  <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>and other European banks in 1962, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> acquired <italic>Banque Commerciale Africaine</italic>\u2019s network in Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, and Congo. \nIn 1963, EEC signed a funding agreement with 18 African states alongside Madagascar. Another $70 million of aid was committed to French overseas territories and the four French overseas departments. While <italic>Bank of Lagos</italic> surrendered her license and began operations as <italic>Finance </italic><italic>Co</italic><italic> of Lagos</italic>, <italic>Standard Bank</italic> of London merged with BBWA<italic> </italic>and gained investment from David Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Chase</italic> Nigeria in 1965. Since David Buckman became an assistant treasurer in <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s International Department as Lagos branch manager in 1961, he was promoted to Executive Director of <italic>Standard Bank</italic> Nigeria from 1965.\nAnd as BFWA reorganized with capital from <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic> Chair James Stillman Rockefeller bought shares in British <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s merchant bank <italic>Samuel</italic>. Moreover, international development banks followed, including <italic>African Development Bank</italic> in 1964, <italic>Asian Development Bank</italic> in 1966, and <italic>East African Development Bank</italic> in 1967. After shaping Sudan\u2019s monetary institutions, Mamoun Beheiry became the first President of <italic>African Development Bank </italic>from 1964 to 1970. \nWhile the uncle of Beidas\u2019 wife was elected to Parliament in 1957, Lebanon\u2019s near civil war halted banking in 1958, <italic>Intra</italic> became Beirut\u2019s largest bank and branched to London and Geneva. By 1962, <italic>Intra</italic> was Beirut\u2019s largest bank with 16 branches across Europe and the Arab world. The reason for <italic>Intra</italic>\u2019s growth was that Beidas was outside of the handful of Sunni and Christian families that split control of Lebanon.\nThe Sunni Solh family continued to split control over Lebanese politics in the 1960s, their strategic marriages also reinforced international alliances. Shortly before his assassination in 1951, Lebanon PM Riad Solh converted from Sunni to Shia Islam, allowing his daughters to inherit his wealth. One of Riad\u2019s daughters married the son of the inaugural King Abdulaziz Saud of Saudi Arabia and became Lebanon\u2019s Finance Minister by 1960, her sister married Prince Moulay Abdallah of Morocco in 1961. \nA quarter of Lebanon\u2019s politicians were rival Christian factions involved in banking. While banker Michel Chiha designed the constitution, his sister married Sursock-cousin President Khouri. Elias Sarkis, another banker, served as Chief of Staff for President Fouad Chehab from 1958 to 1964. Alongside Sarkis, Farid Roufael, founder of <italic>Libano-French Bank</italic>, served as Minister of Finance. Since President \u00c9dd\u00e9\u2019s sons with a Sursock entered politics, one led his father\u2019s political party, while another became Minister of Finance and CEO of <italic>Beirut Riyad Bank</italic>. After Sursock-cousin Petro Trad served as President, <italic>Lyonnais</italic> bought <italic>Trad</italic> bank with a Sursock director, and Petro\u2019s niece wed Charles Helou, Chehab\u2019s advisor and successor. \nSince Syria nationalized and consolidated private, <italic>British Bank of the Middle East</italic>, and other private banks into the credit monopoly <italic>Commercial Bank of Syria</italic><italic> </italic>in 1961, Lebanon <italic>Central </italic>formed <italic>Bank of Lebanon</italic> as her central bank in 1964, replacing the currency board since <italic>Bank of Syrian & Lebanon</italic> became <italic>Central Bank of Syria</italic> in 1948. When Helou appointed Joseph Oughourlian, the husband of a Trad, as Governor of <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of Lebanon</italic> in 1964, the Edd\u00e9s and their allies feared that he would favor French interests. The opposition to Oughourlian led to the confirmation of Philip Takla, son-in-law of Georges Maalouf, the Khouri in-law co-founder of <italic>Bank of Lebanon & Overseas</italic>. \nIn 1960, Egypt nationalized <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic>, splitting it into <italic>Central Bank</italic> and <italic>National Bank</italic>. While the former remained the fiscal and monetary agent, the latter assumed the management of import-exports and acquired foreign-owned banks. These included the nationalized <italic>Barclay </italic>Egypt (renamed <italic>Bank of Alexandria</italic>), the Arab merchant owned <italic>Misr Bank</italic>, and the Jewish <italic>Bank of Cairo </italic>and <italic>Zilkha Bank</italic>, to consolidate power and reduce landowner and merchant influence. The same year, <italic>Misr Bank</italic> branched to Sudan.\nWithin a year, Egypt nationalized cotton and other businesses. While Copts were particularly effected, <italic>Mansour </italic>fled to the Sudan. As Maurice Zilkha fled to Italy and led various financial and investment companies in Paris, the family\u2019s second generation diversified their interests, including ventures like <italic>Zilkha Energy</italic> in Texas. Amidst these developments, Hawrani and Nasser disagreed on Israel policy, leading them to dissolve United Arab Republic in 1961.\nDenying antisemitism, SCP claimed to be anti-racist and instituted educational quotas based on the Soviet Union\u2019s 15 republic nationalities. Since forced Jewish resettlement to Siberia did not take place, Jewish representation collapsed. Despite an overall increase in university enrollment, the number of Jewish students fell from 74,900 in 1935 to 45,800 in 1960. \nIn 1967, the percentage of Jews among total scientific personnel was less than half what it had been two decades earlier. By 1970, the proportion of Jewish students in the total university student population had dropped from 13% to just 2.5%. The same discrimination extended to exclusion from leadership roles in the government, banks, and other official institutions. Likewise, Russian institutions discriminated against Christian from Eastern Europe in favor of ethnic Russians and Central Asians, likely to gain favor with the Middle East.\nInstead of Jewish or East European technocrats and bankers, Stalin-era government insiders gained control of the economy. Belarussian Vladimir Geraschenko began his career as a researcher at <italic>Rostov Financial & Economic Institute</italic> in the 1930s before becoming its director. When his brother was arrested in 1937, he transitioned to <italic>Bank of Soviet Union</italic> (\u201cBSU\u201d), where he led Foreign Operations and rose to the position of Deputy Chair by 1940. After SCP expelled him in 1958, he transitioned to academia. By 1960, Vladimir\u2019s son, Viktor, starting to work with BSU.\nFrom late 1959, Soviet law sought to maintain state control and authority over economic activities and property by using broad definitions, allowing for flexible prosecution, and reinforcing state power. Amidst the anti-economic crime campaign, Jews were disproportionately targeted, with over 50% of nearly 250 publicly executed being Jews, reaching 80% in Ukraine. Likewise, SCP closed the largest synagogues of Lemberg and Chernovtsi claiming that the residents demanded an end to the pro-Israel and anti-Soviet propaganda. By 1962, food price hikes sparked unrest in the industrial city of Novocherkassk, on Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine and the Black Sea. At the Budenny electric locomotive works, management raised piecework norms, lowering wages. Workers protested, leading to a factory-wide strike and deadly clashes with KGB troops. But the state media blamed Jews, producing Nazi-style antisemitic literature.\nWhile <italic>Sullivan</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Arthur Dean negotiated a nuclear test ban and disarmament from 1961, the Cold War almost turned hot until the Soviet Union decided against keeping nuclear missiles in Cuba in October 1962. Amidst famine, <italic>Narodny</italic> Beirut opened to buy grain from Australia, Canada, and America using Lebanese gold via MMEU in London in 1962. Until that year, BSU\u2019s <italic>Foreign Operations </italic>department serviced all foreign operations, while <italic>Vneshtorg</italic> specialized only in foreign private individuals. From then, <italic>Vneshtorg</italic>, a joint-stock company whose shareholders included BSU and other institutions, served as the Soviet EXIM bank. \nBy August 1963, Dean joined Under Secretary for Political Affairs Averell Harriman to sign a treaty with Moscow. As Soviet gold sales through<italic> Samuel Montagu</italic> in London increased, SCP disavowed antisemitic literature due to international pressure only in 1964. The importance of this evolution is visible through the promotions of Viktor Gerashchenko. After starting to work with BSU in 1960, Gerashchenko moved to <italic>Vneshtorg</italic> in 1962, and <italic>Narodny </italic>London by 1965. \nVladimir Ponomarev, a second cousin of the Soviet Union\u2019s long-time International Central Committee member Boris Ponomarev, was a BSU and <italic>Narodny </italic>Paris executive before heading <italic>Vneshtorg</italic>. Leading <italic>Narodny</italic> Paris from 1965, Guy Boysson\u2014of an aristocratic family and married Genevi\u00e8ve Chevrillon, whose uncle had married a Porges Schnapper cousin of the Rothschilds at the turn of the century\u2014rose in the ranks of the French government after WWII until joining <italic>Narodny</italic> Paris in 1950. While he, Guy\u2019s cousin Max was a director of <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris from 1967.  \nAfter former <italic>Bank</italic> <italic>Melli</italic> Chair Abol Ebtehaj directed <italic>BANK</italic>-funded infrastructure and industrialization projects through <italic>Persian </italic><italic>Plan Organization</italic>, tensions with the Shah escalated over military spending and the allocation of oil revenues. In 1959, after loss of royal support and legislation transferred <italic>Plan Organization</italic> authority to the PM, Ebtehaj resigned. That same year, Iran requested IMF assistance and adopted an austerity program. As Iran split <italic>Bank</italic> <italic>Melli</italic>, which remained the country\u2019s largest bank, and <italic>Bank Markazi</italic>, the central bank, in 1960, Ebtehaj founded <italic>Bank-e Iranian</italic> and publicly criticized American aid and military spending by the Iranian government. When he returned to Tehran, he was arrested and held without charges for seven months. \nA drought in 1962 worsened food inflation and economic conditions. In 1963, following mass protests and the arrest of Ruhollah Khomeini\u2014a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad\u2014for opposing the Shah\u2019s Western alignment, America\u2019s Embassy approached Ebtehaj as a potential PM. He declined, demanding military downsizing, Shah\u2019s constitutional limits, and Iran\u2019s withdrawal from the pro-Western Central Treaty Organization. To maintain the currency amidst food imports, Iran cabinet lowered domestic gasoline and kerosene subsidies in 1964, triggering widespread protests and strikes. Still, the government proceeded with progressive land reform and education expansion.\nMeanwhile, Libya arrested Nasserist and <italic>Baath</italic> advocates, leading to the conviction of 87 individuals on charges of a \u2018communist conspiracy\u2019 against the monarchy. To counter this trend, Libya\u2019s King Idris changed the constitution in 1963 to centralize power, exacerbating the situation, resulting in the loss of key officials\u2019 lives and an escalation of government suppression in 1964.\nWhen the Arif brothers overthrew Iraqi dictator Qasim in early 1963 and nationalized <italic>British Bank of </italic><italic>the </italic><italic>Middle East</italic> soon after, they energized <italic>Baath</italic> in Syria. While they lacked a militia and support among crucial sectors, Nasser\u2019s attempts to restore United Arab Republic alarmed the Alawite Salah Jadid, who purged Nasser loyalists. Growing Marxist influence within <italic>Baath </italic>to consolidate power, Jadid excluded Michel Aflaq and other founding <italic>Baath </italic>members from power. Like Syria did in 1961, Iraq nationalized the Chalabi family-led <italic>Rafidain Bank</italic>, <italic>British Bank of the Middle East</italic>, and other private banks in 1964, merging commercial banks into a single state-owned <italic>Rafidain </italic>and creating specialized banks for agriculture, industry, real estate, and socialist sectors. \nIn Sudan, since Rahman and Mirghani joined to oust Azhari in favor of Abd Khalil as PM in 1956, dissent by non-Muslims grew in Southern Sudan. A rebellion erupted in 1955, with the Southerners objecting to Islamization and Marxism. By 1958, Khalil led an army coup and brought down the parliamentary regime, establishing a junta under Ibrahim Abbud. The regime\u2019s response worsened the situation, leading to a civil war by 1964. Street demonstrations in late 1964 forced Abbud and his colleagues to resign, paving the way for a Transitional Government. New elections in 1965 brought a coalition of <italic>Umma</italic> and <italic>Unionists</italic> to power, with Muhammad Mahjoub as PM and Ismail Azhari as President of the Supreme Council of State. \nLikewise in Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah dictatorial rule and nationalization policies in 1964, which included taking control of most of Ghana\u2019s gold mines except <italic>Ashanti Goldfields</italic>, led to his removal in 1966 with CIA aid. The new government increased involvement in mining companies including <italic>Ashanti</italic>, acquiring a majority stake, and requiring the company to change its name and move its headquarters.\nSince his father served as Commander of the Holy Jihad militia in 1948, Faisal Husayni associated with his cousin, Cairo-born Yasser Arafat, in nationalist Marxism while in Egypt in the 1950s. Returning to Jerusalem, Husayni co-established <italic>General Union of Palestinian Students</italic> in 1959. While <italic>Masri</italic> solidified as the West Bank\u2019s largest employer out of Nablus, Mohammed Jabari of Hebron resigned from Jordan\u2019s senate and joined Yasser Arafat, Hikmat Masri, and Husayni to found <italic>Palestine Liberation Organization</italic> (\u201cPLO\u201d) with Soviet KGB support in 1964. Soviet agents also helped foster PLO\u2019s ideology and create an Palestinian identity for Arabs from Palestine. Within a year, Masri cousins formed <italic>Jordanian</italic> <italic>Vegetable Oils Co</italic>. While Hikmat founded <italic>An-Najah Uni</italic> in Nalbus and held influential positions in Jordan\u2019s government, his nephew Taher joined Jordan\u2019s central bank.\nMasri were also prominent among the Arab diaspora from Palestine. After Hikmat\u2019s cousin Munib moved to America and studied geology at <italic>Uni of Texas at Austin</italic>, he returned to Jordan by 1957, and started his career at <italic>Phillips Petroleum</italic>, becoming President of <italic>Phillips</italic> Algeria by 1963 and subsequently COO of <italic>Phillips </italic>Middle East. During those years, Munib established an oil and gas engineering services company in Jordan that later became EDGO and, like his cousins, became close with PLO Chair Yasser Arafat. Likewise, Hikmat\u2019s brother Sabih moved to Saudi Arabia, where he became close to the ruling family and started <italic>Arab Supply & Trading Corp</italic> (\u201cASTRA\u201d) in 1967, soon becoming the food caterer of the Saudi military. \nAs more decolonized nations embraced Marxism, Communists seized control of Belgian Congo in 1965, Mobutu Sese Seko declared a new government and established the single-party rule in 1967. Enforcing Africanization and renaming the country Zaire, Mobutu later aligned with Maoist China and consolidated power through state patronage and suppressed dissent and Communism. \nThrough Africa, Soviet ideals spread to America. Malcolm X closely observed the spread of Marxism and decolonization, and he called on African Americans not to align themselves solely with White liberals. As Black grassroots organizers planned a radical protest in DC in 1963, the Kennedy Administration sought to moderate it. Working with <italic>Taconic Foundation</italic>\u2014led by Andrew Mellon\u2019s granddaughter, her Warburg-related Prue husband, and their attorney founder of <italic>Paul Weiss</italic>\u2014directed funds to NAACP, Urban League, and  other civil rights groups willing to coordinate with federal officials, leading Malcolm X to accuse them of emasculation.\nInstead, he urged them to identify with other oppressed people. Malcolm believed in elevating the struggle for Black freedom to an international level, aligning with movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America against \u2018American neocolonialism.\u2019 In addition to advocating for a rejection of capitalism, Malcolm X converted to Islam and drew attention to the plight of \u201cPalestinians\u201d starting in the late 1950s. He visited Gaza refugee camps months before his assassination in 1965.\nAfter North Rhodesia gained independence from Britain as Black-led Zambia by 1965, Southern Rhodesia unilaterally declared independence as White-led Rhodesia under PM Ian Smith. UN\u2019s Security Council authorized Britain\u2019s Royal Navy to prevent oil from South Africa from reaching apartheid Rhodesia via Mozambique from 1966. Through this time, Ethel Katz continued to shape public opinion against apartheid. Engaging in underground work for ANC and aiding activists\u2019 escape from the country, Katz became executive secretary of <italic>Anti-Apartheid Movement</italic> in 1967, and masterminded campaigns to reshape <italic>Labour Party</italic> policy to align with the southern African liberation movements. \nOrganizing protests during the Springbok rugby tour of 1969, Ethel\u2019s efforts blocked arm sales to Ian Smith\u2019s apartheid regime in Rhodesia. That year, Smith updated the <italic>Land Apportionment Act of 1930</italic>, reduced national parks lands by 33% to increase the land allocated to the Black majority by 2%, while maintaining most of the land for the European White minority. Over the same time, former British imperial banks consolidated. After Africa-focused <italic>Standard</italic> acquired BBWA in 1965, HSBC\u2019s rival East Asia-focused <italic>Chartered Bank</italic> broke her Africa-sharing contract with <italic>Chase, </italic>merging with <italic>Standard</italic> in 1969. \nIn the gold capital of the Middle East, Lebanon\u2019s largest banker, Yusuf Beidas of<italic> Intra</italic>, did not have the close ties to the state of the rival political banker oligarchy. So, amidst the <italic>Panic of 1966</italic>, the new <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of Lebanon</italic> withheld liquidity from <italic>Intra</italic>. As accusations of fraud were levied against <italic>Intra</italic>\u2019s board, New York regulators seized <italic>Intra </italic>New York for receivership, but <italic>Bank of America</italic> and <italic>Chase</italic> refused to hand over deposits. Weeks after graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> Business and joining <italic>Kidder</italic>, Roger Tamraz, convinced Chair Albert Gordon to invest in <italic>Intra</italic> by 1967. As small depositors received refunds, the New York branch entered receivership and was sold. Following this, assets were allocated among <italic>Intra </italic>and <italic>Marchek Bank</italic>, the JV of <italic>Morgan </italic>and Lebanese financiers. Soon after reorganizing <italic>Intra</italic>, <italic>Kidder</italic> facilitated a bond issue for<italic> EgyptAir</italic>. \nWhile Fouad Chehab became Governor of <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of Lebanon</italic> from 1966 until becoming President of Lebanon in 1976, the son of Michel Chiha\u2019s sister and former President Khouri served as Governor of <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of Lebanon</italic> from 1977 to 1984 and 1991 to 1994. Likewise, Sunni banker Salim Hoss chaired the <italic>Banking Control Commission</italic> from 1967 to 1976 and served as PM of Lebanon four times between 1976 and 2000. \nLikewise, the Soviet Union remained committed to Lebanon. Since joining <italic>Vneshtorg</italic> in 1962, Viktor Gerashchenko moved to <italic>Narodny </italic>London in 1965, and to <italic>Narodny </italic>Beirut by 1967. Since <italic>Narodny</italic> London left the gold market in 1965, <italic>Narodny</italic> Zurich opened in 1966, allowing the Soviets to buy gold from Switzerland instead. Soon establishing a Tehran branch, <italic>Narodny</italic> sought to branch to Tokyo.\nMeanwhile, Islamist radicalism increasingly spread in Northern Nigeria against Westernization and the Christian South. In 1962, Kano authorities deported Muhammadu Marwa for his anti-establishment activities. Despite preaching Islam, Marwa used charms and amulets, including human body parts, and was imprisoned in 1973 for inciting violence. Instead of reforming him, these events made Marwa and his followers more defiant, leading to further legal clashes.\nSimilarly, in Bedde, a man named Yusuf rejected Western education. The Bedde Emirate gained prominence in 1825 after colonization by the Muslim Bade tribe, originally from the Kanem and Lake Chad region, ruled by the Dugum dynasty since then and continued under British governance. In 1945, Umar Suleiman, educated in both Western and Islamic traditions, inherited the emirate. Although he banished Yusuf in the 1960s, Yusuf\u2019s son, Mohammed, continued his father\u2019s activities and formed Boko Haram in the early 2000s. Despite rejecting Western education and technology, Mohammed Yusuf continued to use mobile phones and cars, reflecting the hypocrisy of Marwa.\nAmidst the riots, a faction of military officers initiated a coup against Nigeria\u2019s corrupt and nepotistic politicians in early 1966. This coup resulted in the deaths of key political figures from Nigeria\u2019s inaugural republic, including the PM, Finance Minister, Northern Region Premier, and Western Region Premier. This instability led to a retaliation coup, a series of pogroms against Igbo civilians. By May 1967, the declaration of Biafra\u2019s independence, precipitating Nigeria\u2019s Civil War.\nAlso in 1966, Iran announced its intention to abrogate an agreement had governed shipping on the Shatt Arab River on the Iran-Iraq border since 1937. Though Iraq\u2019s Arif regime defused the situation, <italic>Baath</italic> continued to gain power. Since Syrian <italic>Baath </italic>sidelined Aflaq in 1963, he waged a coup by 1966, leading Jadid to purge 400 officials and officers and promote fellow Alawite Hafez Assad to Defense Minister.\nIn June 1967, the Soviets aided Egypt, Syria, and Jordan with support from Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia to invade Israel in the <italic>Six Day War</italic>. After Israel won, Egypt closed <italic>Suez Canal</italic> and Arab oil exporters embargoed oil against America, Britain, and West Germany for nearly a decade. But as TRC raised production limits, unlike in 1957, oil prices did not spike. In America, the Black Power activists divisively aligned with Arabs. \nAs Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank, <italic>Palestine Electric Co</italic> was renamed <italic>Israel Electric Corp</italic> and became the primary electricity provider in the region. Nonetheless, in line with Arab initiatives from the 1930s, the Arab Palestinian territories established their own electricity distribution companies. After failing to gain a UN government in the West Bank, Mohammed Jabari of Hebron developed the local Islamic sharia college into<italic> Hebron Uni </italic>in 1971. He was subsequently elected as Mayor of Hebron. Soon after Mohammed died in 1980, his son became President of <italic>Hebron Uni</italic> in 1983. By then his Jabari clan grew to 30,000 people. \nWith the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> blockade, Britain was desperate to maintain oil imports and supported a \u2018One Nigeria\u2019 solution was largely motivated by its economic interests in Nigerian oil, notably through <italic>Shell</italic>-<italic>British Petroleum</italic>, and the need to ensure oil-related stability. While Britain and Nigeria blockaded Biafra, resulting in severe malnutrition and disease among civilians, France, seeking to diminish Nigeria\u2019s influence in its former West African colonies, supported Biafra due to her economic interests in Eastern Region oil. \nAs disruptions in oil-producing regions and agriculture felled export earnings, Nigeria resorted to short-term borrowing through Treasury Bills, Treasury Certificates, and Ways & Means Advances. In 1967, the country introduced a Compulsory Savings Scheme to mitigate inflation, accompanied by tax adjustments. Likewise, the Nigerian <italic>pound</italic> faced a challenge when the British <italic>pound</italic> was devalued, yet Nigeria opted not to devalue her own currency. During these years, the government also imposed bans on certain luxury goods imports and implemented stricter controls over FX transactions to conserve FX reserves.\n<italic>Rothschild</italic> London continued to lead the gold fixing in London but priced in <italic>dollars</italic>. Having entered Britain by buying <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s merchant bank <italic>Samuel</italic> in 1963, <italic>Citi</italic> sold her stake in 1968. By 1968, <italic>Citi</italic> acquired a large stake <italic>Grindlay </italic>alongside <italic>Lloyd </italic>Bank, which bought fifty-one <italic>TURK</italic> branches across the Middle East and North Africa. While authorized JMB to deal FX, BOE oversaw<italic> Midland</italic>\u2019s purchase of gold trader <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> by September 1968. To stem broker losses on gold, BOE devalued her <italic>pound</italic> in November. However, the Middle East continued to deteriorate following the humiliating defeat in the <italic>Six Day War</italic>.\nAfter Saudi Arabia closed all <italic>Cairo Bank</italic> and <italic>Misr</italic> branches in 1967, Egypt confiscated Saudi assets. But in Iran, a year after <italic>Bank Melli</italic>, the country\u2019s largest commercial bank, branched to London in 1967, <italic>Citi</italic> acquired 35% of <italic>Bank-e Iranian</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Chase</italic> maintained strong relations with <italic>Melli</italic>, the central bank <italic>Bank Markazi</italic>, and the oil monopoly <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic>.  While only Iranian <italic>Bank Melli</italic>, Iraqi <italic>Rafidain</italic>, and the European-origin <italic>TURK</italic> had London offices in the late 1960s, over two dozen Middle Eastern banks formed there through the 1970s. Iranian and Turkish banks, lacking national joint institutions, opened separate offices, including <italic>Bazargani</italic>, <italic>Pars</italic>, <italic>Saderat</italic>, <italic>Sepah</italic>, <italic>Akbank</italic>, <italic>Ziraat</italic>, <italic>Turkiye Is</italic>, and <italic>Yapi ve Kredi</italic>.\nIn Iraq, Saddam Hussein\u2019s <italic>Baath Party</italic> seized control in 1968, and then expelled thousands of Iranian Shia. By April 1969, Iran abrogated her treaty with Iraq regarding the shared Shatt Arab River. Amidst the conflict, Minos Zombanakis formed <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic> London with minority investment from <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and organized a $80 million syndicated loan to Iran, establishing the use of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLibor\u201d) for MMEU transactions. \nLikewise, Nasserist sentiment grew in Libya, spurring violence against Jews until the government proclaimed a state of emergency and curfew. By September 1969, Muammar Qaddafi overthrew King Idris in a military coup. Despite concerns of oil nationalization, <italic>Occidental</italic> beat out rival Bunker Hunt in negotiating a new agreement in 1970. Since Syrian military purges of 1966 left the country ill-prepared for war, public discontent with <italic>Baath</italic> grew. As Jadid\u2019s faction opposed compromise with Israel, rejecting UN Resolution 242 and disapproved of American peace initiatives, Assad consolidated power and sidelined Jadid as he centralized government by 1970. \nAnd in the Sudan, the dysfunctional <italic>Umma</italic> and <italic>Unionist</italic> coalition lacked substantive solutions to the issues facing Sudan. As Gaafar Nimeiri and his military colleagues seized power in a bloodless coup in May 1969, Sudan pivoted a left, with the Soviet Union providing economic and military aid, including fighter jets and ground-to-air missiles for the war in the Southern Sudan. Total trade with Eastern Europe surged to 25% of Sudan\u2019s exports and 18% of its imports. \nAmidst the Arab-Israeli conflict that year, Sudan severed diplomatic relations with America. As Nimeiri signed a treaty with Libya\u2019s Qaddafi, he mirrored Nasser, nationalizing industry, leading <italic>Mansour</italic> to flee to Switzerland. While Saudi Arabia stopped an officer\u2019s coup\u2014possibly with information from CIA\u2014in June, Indian PM Indira Nehru nationalized fourteen banks\u2014accounting for 70% of the country\u2019s credit\u2014into <italic>State Bank of India</italic> to expand rural credit in July 1969.\nLikewise, in the summer of 1967, the Soviet Union initiated a propaganda campaign targeting Zionism as a scapegoat to divert internal dissatisfaction and justify setbacks, such as Arab states\u2019 defeats and diplomatic failures. By then <italic>Ukrainian Academy of Sciences</italic> published Trofim Kichko\u2019s book alleging a conspiracy involving \u2018international Zionist bankers\u2019 with the objective of using the Middle East as a strategic base against the socialist world and global workers\u2019 and liberation movements. Like the Nazis, Kichkio included the Christian Rockefellers as emblematic of Jewish capitalists. As Kichko received a \u2018certificate of honor\u2019 in 1968, the campaign progressively intensifying anti-Zionist rhetoric. \nA year after Poland financed Israel\u2019s Communist Party, after a protest against censorship spurred <italic>Warsaw Uni</italic> students to rebel n March 1968. Accusing Zionists of instigating the rebellion, Poland expelled Jews from party and government posts. By the summer, the Soviet Union\u2019s focus shifted from the Middle East to quash rebellion in Czechoslovakia, portraying world Zionism as part of an international capitalist conspiracy to undermine Communist states.\nBut while Jews like Karl Marx helped form Communism, much of the Jewish diaspora eschewed Zionism as they industrialized the Third World. From WWII, Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s plantation-based economy shifted to oil refining. <italic>Maduro</italic> applied for a government permit to open a bank in 1901 but succeeded only in 1916, later becoming Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s dominant bank. They also diversified early on. In 1901, they bought <italic>Nieuwe Werf</italic> dock coal yard, opened <italic>Juliana Wharf</italic> in 1913, acquired <italic>Motet</italic> dock in 1916, and constructed <italic>Emma</italic> and <italic>Wilhelmina</italic> wharves in 1917 and <italic>Hendrik</italic> and <italic>Oranje</italic> wharves in 1927. In 1936, <italic>Maduro</italic> partnered with John Eman to open <italic>Aruba Bank</italic>. Although <italic>Maduro </italic>sold their interest in <italic>Aruba Bank</italic> in 1962 they retained a branch there. In 1960, <italic>Maduro </italic>partnered with several Dutch firms to start a paint factory.\nSince the 1920s, <italic>Maduro </italic>kinterlinked with <italic>Henriques </italic>of Jamaica. Cousins of <italic>Samuel Phillips</italic>, the Henriques family of Jamaica established <italic>Henriques Construction</italic> in 1907 to help rebuild Kingston after the earthquake. In 1908, they founded <italic>Kingston Industrial Works</italic> and <italic>Kingston Industrial Garage</italic>, Jamaica\u2019s first industrial repair firm and car dealership. In the 1930s, the family acquired <italic>New Yarmouth</italic> and modernized its sugar factory by 1947. OK Henriques, influential in business and government, served on boards, including <italic>Bank of Nova Scotia Jamaica</italic> and <italic>Jamaica Mutual Insurance</italic>. After OK\u2019s death in 1951, Emanuel Cohen Henriques succeeded him. \nBy 1914, <italic>Henriques</italic> kinterlinked with the Syrian Sephardi <italic>Matalon</italic>. Since Joseph Matalon founded <italic>Matalon</italic> in Jamaica in 1910. Despite bankruptcy in 1934, <italic>Matalon</italic> expanded into real estate construction, undertaking projects like the Mona housing development in 1958 and <italic>Harbor View</italic> in 1960. In 1962, they formed <italic>Industrial Commercial</italic> <italic>Developments</italic> to consolidate their ventures. Through strategic initiatives, they maintained control while diversifying into pharmaceuticals with <italic>PA Benjamin</italic> and manufacturing with <italic>West Indies Paints</italic>.\nIn Chile, in 1958, the Jewish Furman family established <italic>Banco Continental</italic>. Noy Furman played a key role in <italic>Banco Israelita de Chile</italic>. In 1960, the Furmans sold <italic>Banco Continental</italic> to the Yarurs but maintained ties with <italic>Israelita</italic>. Meanwhile, established Christian families like the British-descended Edwards managed their financial interests through <italic>Edwards</italic> and <italic>Banco Sud Americano</italic>, along families such as the Larrains, Mattes, and Subercaseaux. <italic>Banco de Chile</italic>, the largest bank, had a diverse board from various industrial groups. <italic>Banco de Credito e Inversiones</italic> was controlled by the Yarurs, with the Luksics and Tefarikis in the Antofagasta branch.\nJews also were prominent in Argentina. Since the converted aristocrat Gilbert Cah\u00e9n joined <italic>Lee</italic><italic> Higginson</italic> in 1928 until 1931. Shortly after leaving America for <italic>Paribas</italic> in France, he married into a founding family of Buenos Aires. By 1938, he was a director at <italic>Elaboraci</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>n General del Plomo</italic>, <italic>Esta\u00f1o Aluminio</italic>, <italic>Comercial e Inmobiliaria</italic> <italic>Paraguayo-Argentina</italic>, and was associated with <italic>Bank of London & South America</italic>. \nErnesto Oppenheimer moved to Argentina in 1920 after serving in WWI. He joined coffee<italic> </italic>importer<italic> Bonafide</italic> as manager in 1936. Under his leadership, the company, initially focused on, expanded to 120 branches. Oppenheimer adapted to the political climate of Juan Peron\u2019s government, forming connections with officials and contributing to Evita Peron\u2019s Social Aid Foundation.\nIn the early 1920s, Julius Strupp\u2014whose Wertheim mother was related to the Frankfurt sewing industrialist with an unknown connection to Samson Wertheim\u2014founded <italic>Strupp</italic> in New York with <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> of Basel and Frankfurt, focusing on German bonds and business in Argentina. In 1937, Strupp opened a new bank in Buenos Aires with foreign investment and local partnerships. Due to his anti-Nazi stance and support for Jewish refugees, he was attacked in 1943. Surviving, he formed another partnership with his in-law Federico Gutheim and Julio Roos, an in-law of a Wertheim family and extended Dreyfu\u00df cousin, after WWII, and worked until  his death in 1960.\nAnd born to refugees from Bessarabia in 1918, Julio Werthein transitioned his father\u2019s business from hotels to banking and ranching. In 1953, the Werthein founded <italic>El Pampero</italic>, venturing into manufacturing television sets and electric resistors. In 1959, they acquired <italic>Banco El Hogar Argentino</italic>, later selling it to obtain <italic>Banco Mercantil Argentino</italic> in 1963, which became Argentina\u2019s twelfth-largest bank by 1982.\nBy then, decolonization had swept through the Middle East, with locals replacing imperial colonists. While losing her monopoly in Kuwait and elsewhere, BBME was nationalized in Syria in 1961, Iraq in 1964, Aden in 1969, and Libya in 1970. As BBME\u2019s 30-year lease in Kuwait approached expiration in 1971, she shifted her regional focus to Bahrain. After BBME\u2019s Kuwaiti operations ended in 1971, <italic>Bank of Kuwait </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>the Middle East</italic><italic> </italic>replaced her.\nSince developing pipes for Sinai and Iranian oil, Israel elected Golda Meir as PM in 1969, the first head of state without the benefit of family ties to a famous father or an assassinated husband. While Israel and Egypt continued to be at war, Nasser died in 1970, and his chosen successor, Anwar Sadat took over. As Egypt\u2019s military spending was impeding economic development, Sadat recognized that negotiations with Israel could not progress while Israel maintained control over the Sinai and the eastern bank of <italic>Suez Canal</italic>. So, he formed a strategic partnership with Syria\u2019s Assad in 1971. This alliance was initially conceived within the framework of the Federation of Arab Republics, which included Egypt, Syria, Libya, and Sudan, and was announced in April 1971.\nWhile Lebanon regulated banks since Lebanon\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Intra</italic>, failed in 1966, Jordan expelled Arab Palestinians in 1970, pushing refugees and PLO armed militants into Lebanon and the country to the brink of civil war. At the same time, elite Arab Palestinians thrived in Jordan. While working at <italic>Phillip Petroleum</italic>, Munib Masri established EDGO, one of the region\u2019s first privately owned engineering companies, to support oil and gas industry in the Persian Gulf. By 1970, at King Hussein\u2019s request, he served as Jordan\u2019s <italic>Minister of Public Works</italic> and building road and water infrastructures across Jordan. \nLikewise, Bolivian General Candia nationalized <italic>Gulf Oil</italic>\u2019s holdings, offering compensation from the future profits of the nationalized firm in 1969. As Marxist Salvador Allende became President of Chile, he revoked copper concessions and refused indemnification due to excess profits. As Augustin Edwards V fled for America, <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s David Rockefeller and <italic>PepsiCo</italic> supported him. \nRelying on National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger\u2014an extended Stern and Oppenheim cousin, whose family fled Nazi Germany to America, where he earned a <italic>Harvard</italic> History PhD and worked at <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic> and <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic>\u2014and IT&T funds, CIA created a coup against Allende. As IT&T negotiated with the Nixon Administration, IT&T\u2019s banker Felix Rohatyn of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York warned DOJ that the loss of access to <italic>Hartford</italic>\u2019s float would bankrupt IT&T. So, DOJ allowed the merger but ordered divestments. As IT&T\u2019s political wrangling became public, Congress opted to investigate after the 1972 Presidential election.\nDespite American efforts, Chile\u2019s Allende began nationalizing industries. In mid-1971, America abstained on <italic>BANK</italic> loans to Bolivia and Guyana due to expropriation disputes. A month later, Guyana nationalized aluminum. While America denied ECGD credits to Chile to buy <italic>Boeing</italic> jets as a response to expropriation, <italic>Lazard</italic> London the British ECGD provided a line of credit for Chile\u2019s steel industry. By 1972, Allende nationalized <italic>Anaconda</italic> and <italic>Kennecott</italic> copper companies with the cooperation of copper companies and America to prevent the Socialist Party from exploiting the issue in the elections.\nIn Africa, meanwhile, race continued to intertwine domestic and international politics. In 1969, Ghana\u2019s new PM Kofi Busia required illegal foreigners to obtain work permits or leave. This policy led to the expulsion of between 20,000 and 500,000 Nigerians within three months. To destabilize Sudan, Israel supported General Idi Amin\u2019s coup in Uganda in 1971 by supporting a regime in Uganda that would counteract Sudanese influence. Citing economic malpractice and corruption, Amin soon expelled over 80,000 Indians from Uganda to promote Black African commerce. Soon after, Amin oversaw mass killings carried out by death squads targeting farmers, students, bankers, and politicians from different tribes. \nIn July 1971, Sudan\u2019s military coup ousted Nimeiri, but Egypt and Libya reinstated him. As the Soviet Union refrained from congratulating Nimeiri upon his return, Sudan\u2019s execution of fourteen Communists fueled East European propaganda. While the Soviet press ignored Nimeiri\u2019s notice to cease attacks on his regime, he expelled the Soviet consul and Bulgarian ambassador, and executed Communist leaders and banned the Communist Party. Despite criticism from Cairo, Nimeiri renewed relations with America and granted South Sudan more autonomy in 1972. While America extended EXIM loans and materials for a cotton factory, relations slowed as Khartoum handed Arab Palestinians convicted of murdering American diplomats to PLO. \nLikewise, Egyptian President Sadat initiated a series of purges to remove pro-Soviet elements from Egypt and, in July 1972, expelled as many as 20,000 Soviet military advisers, while continuing to receive Soviet military supplies. Despite making multiple promises of imminent decisive action, the international community remained skeptical of Sadat\u2019s intentions, while discussions between Israel\u2019s PM Meir and Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu hinted at the possibility of Israeli-Egyptian meetings on a diplomatic level. However, his expectations of support from America and the West were not met. Consequently, in 1973, Sadat made the explicit decision to go to war with Israel as a deliberate strategy to create a crisis that would change the prevailing attitudes and potentially pave the way for negotiations.\nAlso in 1972, another bad Soviet harvest led <italic>Narodny</italic> to buy record grain with gold via MMEU for the first time since 1965, with plans to open a Canadian branch. With American oil imports and inflation growing in 1973, BHCs hedged FX risk with MMEU and depositors ran from banks. So, President Nixon floated the <italic>dollar</italic> from gold, quelling inflation and ending <italic>Bretton Woods</italic>. FRS suspended <italic>Reg Q </italic>for large CDs. In April, Nixon replaced 1959\u2019s oil import quotas\u2014that led to OPEC\u2014with tariffs for domestic production. \nAfter Jamaica led neighbors in hiking aluminum taxes in June, the nonaligned summit in Algiers crystallized the ideological legitimacy of the movement of Third World economic nationalism in September, and OPEC shocked global energy in October. On Judaism\u2019s holiest days, Yom Kippur, Soviet-financed Egypt and Syria invaded Israel to recapture the Sinai. As America and Europe supported Israel, OPEC embargoed Europe as well as apartheid South Africa, Rhodesia, and the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique and Angola. While Arabs blacklisted <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and <italic>Warburg</italic> London for several years, leading British PUs to exclude the Jewish banks from operations. After Meir resigned, Israel devalued her <italic>shekel</italic>, hiked PU prices, and promoted exports.\nAfter imperial trade cartels, colonies nationalized energy assets and subsidized expenses, new borders divided resources unevenly. While South Africa allowed ESCOM to retain more profits to reinvest after the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>, protests at <italic>Anglo-America Co</italic>\u2019s <italic>Western Deep Mine</italic> resulted in eleven deaths in September 1973. While South Africa barred Black trade union activity, the <italic>National Union of Mineworkers</italic> emerged, advocating for higher wages and working conditions. Higher gold prices contributed to better working conditions and increased job opportunities, but the migratory labor system and the flooded labor market. \nLikewise, South Africa invested in Rhodesia and the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique. These alliances extended beyond economics, encompassing military, political, labor, transport, and tourism. South Africa provided substantial capital for critical projects, such as the extension of <italic>Nacala</italic> RR into Malawi and the construction of <italic>Kunene Dam</italic> on the Namibia-Angola border. \nAs <italic>Iron & Steel Corp</italic> took a share in Mozambique\u2019s Moatise coal mines in 1974, ESCOM procured hydro-electric power from Mozambique\u2019s <italic>Cabora Bassa Dam</italic>. Along with coordinating a consortium for the dam, <italic>Anglo-American Corp</italic> engaged in mining, diamonds, oil, fishing, and light industry. Supplying over a third of Portugal\u2019s iron ore imports and 15% of its crude oil by 1973, Angola re-exported diamonds to Britain through Lisbon.\nEthel Katz, however, co-founded an initiative to coordinate efforts for release political prisoners and set the stage for a free South Africa. Serving as the executive secretary for <italic>Anti-Apartheid Movement</italic> since 1967, she became Vice Chair in 1974 with the release of her brother.\nIn 1973, a decade after <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> transformed into a central bank, Mauritania left the <italic>franc</italic> zone to introduce her own currency. Meanwhile, <italic>West African Monetary Union</italic> worked on banking reforms with France, leading to a new treaty signed by the remaining seven members and a fresh monetary cooperation agreement with France by the end of the year. These changes reduced the number of French representatives on <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic>\u2019s board and saw Ivory Coast\u2019s Abdoulaye Fadiga, a close associate of Felix Houphouet-Boigny, from become the first Black Governor of<italic> Central</italic> <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> in 1974, as the bank shifted headquarters from Paris to Dakar in Senegal.\nSince FDR\u2019s 1945 agreement with Saudi Arabia, the Western corporate global oil cartel created excess capacity and allowed TRC to be a swing supplier of last resort to America, Europe, and Japan. But Texas could not replace Saudi Arabia. UST eliminated capital controls to finance energy imports by yearend 1973. With OPEC reinvesting into MMEU, American banks borrowed the <italic>dollar</italic> credits. While FRS hiked rates to 8% and OPEC lifted the embargo, inflation continued, and FRS raised rates to 12%. \nSince Jamaica led the Caribbean in hiking aluminum taxes in 1973, America blocked Caribbean multilateral loans, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> and other banks financed aluminum in Australia, UAE\u2019s Dubai, and Brazil as industry relocated from Japan and the Caribbean. <italic>Mitsui</italic> invested in <italic>AMAX</italic>\u2019s aluminum plant. Before long, Western tech made the Soviet Union into the second biggest aluminum producer. By then, Victor Gerashchenko returned to Moscow as <italic>Vneshtorg</italic> deputy manager from <italic>Narodny</italic> Beirut. \nIn the spirt of the <italic>Bretton Woods</italic> agreement, the Saudis and the Gulf agreed to invoice and trade oil in <italic>dollars</italic> in exchange for miliary protection. As the Saudis agreed to buy UST debt and meet annually with UST for American investment, mostly through <italic>Chase</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic>, America developed naval defense across the Gulf from 1974. For this massive project, America hired Munib Masri\u2019s EDGO, who had developed the Saudi navy. Likewise, his cousin Sabih\u2019s Saudi-domiciled ASTRA expanded government contracts from catering into construction from 1976, and soon fertilizer, telecommunications, and manufacturing prefabricated steel buildings, plastics, irrigation systems, and bedding). \nAlso in 1976, Sabih\u2019s brother Zafer joined Nablus\u2019 Municipality Council after chairing Nablus\u2019 <italic>Chamber of Commerce</italic>.  In Sudan, <italic>Chase</italic> NB established a Khartoum branch, <italic>Chevron</italic> explored oil, <italic>Allis-Chalmers</italic> mined iron, and <italic>Northern Electric Co</italic> linked television, telex, and telephone services by 1974. And as Egypt similarly moved back to a market economy, <italic>Mansour</italic> returned as <italic>General Motor</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s dealer and Copts soon controlled a fifth of private enterprise. \nLikewise, Middle Eastern banks reinforced links with America and Europe. Since fleeing Iraq for America in 1856, Ahmad Chalabi graduated MIT and <italic>Univ of Chicago</italic>, then taught at <italic>American Uni </italic>of Beirut. In 1977, he joined Jordan\u2019s <italic>Petra Bank </italic>as Deputy Chair and became CEO in 1981. Although he owned less than one percent of the bank, he controlled its operations while other shareholders included Sabih Masri and Gulf investors as his cousin served as on Jordan\u2019s Banking Control Commission. Chalabi also advised his brother Hazem at <italic>MEBCO Bank </italic>in Switzerland, which served Lebanese clients in West Africa, where Lebanese Jamil Mohamed gained control of Sierra Leone\u2019s diamond fields and fisheries by supporting President Siaka Stevens.   \nBy 1978, Israel traded Sinai oil fields with Egypt for peace to reopen <italic>Suez Canal</italic> for the first time since 1967. Following the hijacking of <italic>Air France</italic> Flight 139 by seven terrorists, including two Germans, Israelis rescued 102 hostages in Entebbe in 1976. In response, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin executed a 73-year-old Jewish woman. In 1978, Amin\u2019s forces invaded Tanzania to annex land west of Lake Victoria but were defeated by Tanzanian troops and Ugandan exiles. By 1979, Amin fled the country.\nAround the same time, protests led Iranian revolutionaries to replace pro-West Shah with anti-capitalist and -Israel theocrats, led by Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini and other descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, who nationalized banks\u2014including <italic>Narodny</italic> Tehran\u2014in June. After the Shah fled Iran, <italic>Chase </italic>NB\u2019s executives\u2014including David Rockefeller\u2014lobbied the Carter Administration to admit the Shah for cancer treatment, leading Iranian students  to seize America\u2019 Embassy in Tehran in November.\nAs American froze Iranian assets, <italic>Bank</italic> <italic>Melli</italic> London worked to maintain operations. Officials reported continuing business through alternative channels, partly guided by Tehran but making many local decisions, while expressing surprise that American banks like <italic>Chase </italic>blocked deposits and a <italic>Chase</italic>-led syndicate had foreclosed on a Shah-era loan. Staff managed customer withdrawals through other banks, keeping financial flows with the West active and minimizing political imagery in the office. \nThe fractured relationships fueled the rise of an internal Arab banks to maintain the flow of oil and credit. Earlier, when <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Rohatyn tried to merge <italic>Lockheed</italic> with <italic>Textron</italic>, UST bailed her out in 1973. Since convincing <italic>Kidder</italic> to reorg in <italic>Intra</italic> in 1967,  Arab Christian Roger Tamraz formed <italic>First Arabian Corp</italic> and took over Detroit banks, but the <italic>Pentagon</italic> blocked his <italic>Lockheed</italic> bid in 1974. Along with seeding <italic>First Arabian</italic>, Gaith Pharaon\u2014the Royal Saudi Physician\u2019s son\u2014invested Saudi funds with <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Credit & Commerce International</italic> (\u201cBCCI\u201d) loans into banks and real estate from 1972. As <italic>Morgan</italic> bought 40% of <italic>Intra</italic>\u2019s banking arm in Beirut in 1973, Rodney Wagner rejoined <italic>Morgan</italic> after a decade with <italic>Agency for International Development</italic> (\u201cUSAID\u201d) to lead the effort. These transactions helped Lebanese gold bridge Middle Eastern oil. \nWhile British <italic>Burma </italic>controlled oil in Burma and India since 1902, India\u2019s partition of 1947 granted half of the region\u2019s oil to Pakistan. Although <italic>BANK</italic> funded an Indian dam, Pakistan sued India for a decade. As oil prices soared, wealthy landowner Zulfikar Bhutto expelled corrupt oil firms as Pakistan\u2019s <italic>Minister for Fuel, Power & Natural Resources</italic>. As Indian PM Indira Nehru nationalized 14 banks\u2014accounting for 70% of the country\u2019s credit\u2014into <italic>State Bank of India</italic> to expand rural credit in 1969. \nSince Pakistan gained independence from India in 1947, most of the Muhajir upper class Muslim refugees from India migrated westward. Other the decades, Punjabi elites marginalized Bengalis in East Pakistan in terms of government resources and industrialization. As East Pakistani noble Sheikh Mujibur Rahman led his political party in a landslide victory in East Pakistan in 1970, the absence of any seats won in West Pakistan led to a crackdown by the Pakistani military in March 1971, resulting in atrocities. Rahman\u2019s arrest and the execution of other East Pakistanis, such as cola magnate Ronanda Shaha, spurred Bangladesh to declare independence. Soon after becoming Deputy PM, Bhutto ascended to the presidency and freed Rahman.\nBy 1974, Bhutto nationalized banks, PUs, and industry. One of those affected was Agha Abedi, who descended from Muslim courtiers to build Pakistan\u2019s largest bank. With his bank nationalized, Abedi secured 25% <italic>Bank of America</italic> funding and the rest with bank licenses from Pharaon and Sheik Zayed Nahyan of UAE\u2019s Abu Dhabi into a <italic>Third World Bank</italic>, the Luxembourg-domiciled BCCI. \nBCCI benefited as Lebanon collapsed into civil war. Since Jordan expelled Arab Palestinians in 1970, pushing around 400,000 refugees and PLO armed militants into Lebanon by 1975. As Lebanese Muslims seeking political reforms supported them, Christian Maronites feared it for Lebanon\u2019s fragile sectarian balance. With leftist groups led by PLO-backed Kamal Jumblatt facing the Christian Phalange party led by Pierre Gemayel and other militias, Lebanese banks collapsed as professionals fled. \nAfter the initial round of fighting ceased in 1976 and Beirut airport reopened. In April 1976, the parliament elected Elias Sarkis, a Chehabist, as President of Lebanon. Later that year, Sarkis appointed Salim Hoss, the President of the Banking Control Commission, as PM. Hoss assembled a Cabinet on late 1976 comprising well-known Chehabists: Fouad Butros as Foreign Minister, Boutros Dib as Minister of Education, Farid Roufael as Minister of Finance, and Farouk Abillama as Director of General Security. Chehabist Michel Khouri, took over as the Governor of <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of Lebanon</italic> from Sarkis.\nWith PLO headquartered in Beirut since 1975, Beirut\u2019s banks experienced a surge in deposits from PLO deposits. A second source was the sale of roughly 30,000 tons of hashish and other illegal drugs, generating annual revenues of up to $2 billion. Moreover, foreign governments, such as Iran, Israel, Iraq, and Libya, financially supported Lebanese. This intricate financial scenario drastically shifted due to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982, significantly altering the political and economic landscape in the region. Using London\u2019s gold bullion market, gold refiner <italic>Johnson</italic>\u2019s JMB bank hid BCCI\u2019s identity. At her height, BCCI was the world\u2019s 5th largest private bank across 74 countries, but about the size of America\u2019s 33rd bank. \nUpon his return to Bangladesh in 1972, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became PM and transitioned to a presidential system in early 1975 following a famine. As Rahman dissolved his political party, disgruntled army officers assassinated Rahman and many of his family. But Pakistani inflation soared as her central bank financed price control and employment with deficits. In 1976, Pakistan struck oil and raised British and <italic>BANK</italic> capital. Within a year, Pakistan\u2019s military executed Bhutto and BCCI gained the oil. \nBy 1977, BCCI grew faster in London than banks since the <italic>secondaries</italic> boom of the early 1970s. Replacing Bhutto, President Zia\u2019s martial-law administration in Pakistan aimed to enforce Islamic principles through a 1981 Provisional Constitutional Order, legalizing Quranic punishments like lashes for drinking, stoning for adultery, and amputation for theft. Despite efforts, Zia\u2019s initiatives, including interest-free banking and aiding the poor, failed to gain true popularity. He faced criticism from both fundamentalists wanting absolute power and the secular middle class.\nWhile Portugal\u2019s <italic>National Overseas Bank</italic> ceased activities in Portuguese India in 1961 and in Portuguese Timor in 1975 due to occupations, former Portuguese colonies established national banks from 1975, including: <italic>Banco Nacional da Guin\u00e9-Bissau</italic>, <italic>Banco de Cabo Verde</italic>, <italic>Banco Nacional de S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe</italic>,<italic> Banco de Mo\u00e7ambique</italic>, and <italic>Banco de Angola</italic>. After the Marxist <italic>People</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Movement for the Liberation of Angola</italic> (\u201cMPLA\u201d) had a military victory in Luanda and gained control of Angola\u2019s coastal oilfields, Angola gained independence from Portugal and MPLA\u2019s Antonio Neto became Angola\u2019s first president. As Angola embraced Marxism and nationalized the currency monopoly <italic>Banco de Angola</italic> and largest commercial bank <italic>Banco Commercial de Angola</italic>. These two banks accounted for 87% of the country\u2019s activities. (<italic>National Overseas </italic>remained the only issuing and commercial bank in the gold-port of Macao.)\nBut as Communist MPLA gained power, the opposing <italic>National Union for the Total Independence of Angola</italic> (\u201cUNITA\u201d) started a civil war by 1975. As Portuguese settlers fled, Neto nationalized the Portuguese oil firm to establish <italic>Sonangol</italic>, which soon becoming MPLA\u2019s primary revenue source as oil accounted for over 90% of Angola\u2019s exports. With <italic>Texaco</italic>, <italic>Shell</italic>, and other foreign enterprises leaving, <italic>Sonangol</italic> bought their assets and contracted Marc Rich\u2019s <italic>Rich</italic> to provide trading services to steering its crude oil and associated derivatives. By 1976, America\u2019s Secretary of State Henry Kissinger outlined a framework Rhodesia. Fusing Joshua Nkomo\u2019s ZAPU and Robert Mugabe\u2019s ZANU exiled liberation movement factions into the Patriotic Front, the apartheid Front split and Ian Smith dissolved Parliament in 1977, with a call for general elections. As ZANU-PF Robert won the election, Mugabe became PM of the newly renamed Zimbabwe.\nNigeria began indigenizing UAC in 1973 by mandating increased local ownership. After Nigerians acquired 40% of UAC\u2019s shares in 1974, <italic>Unilever</italic> sold another 20% by 1977. Aliko Dangote, the great-grandson of UAC\u2019s largest supplier in the 1940s, studied business at <italic>Alazhar</italic> <italic>Uni</italic> in Egypt, and began trading commodities with a loan from his uncle in 1977. Incorporating <italic>Dangote </italic>in 1981, he started manufacturing, and became the world\u2019s richest Black person by the 2000s. Likewise, Molade Okoya-Thomas, the son of CFAO\u2019s first Nigerian hire, became CFAO<italic> Nigeria</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Deputy Managing Director in 1978 and President in the 1990s.<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panic of 1960 & 1966</italic>\nDuring <italic>WWI</italic>, Congress allowed corporations to carry over tax losses (\u201cNOC\u201d) and shareholders to defer taxes for reorgs, including splits and hybrid securities. War ended within a year, and as firms merged to offset taxes, the economy and stock market revived. In the 1920s, Congress expanded tax benefits and set off a merger and hybrid security boom by allowing UST to only tax payouts in <italic>Kerbaugh</italic>. \nWith the fiscal strain in the 1930s, Congress taxed debt reorgs, which the Court allowed by reversing <italic>Kerbaugh</italic> in 1931, slowing the recovery process. TA1934 made debt reorgs tax-free and BA1934 allowed corporate reorgs. In ruling on a 1928 PUHC reorg, the Court created the  <italic>Doctrine</italic> (\u201cGUD\u201d) in 1935 to exempt<italic> </italic>dividend payout taxes in liquidating reorgs to approximate <italic>Kerbaugh</italic>.\nDuring WWII, TV Soong expanded <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> and <italic>Bank of China</italic> to integrate western Chinese cities, but the Japanese invasion forced both banks to withdraw from the areas they occupied. After the war, both banks moved their headquarters back to Shanghai, and <italic>Bank of China</italic> demoted many of her provincial branches. \nAlong with HH Kung, Soong raised funds from Western investors while Chiang Kai-Shek led China\u2019s resistance against Japan. To rebuild and modernize China\u2019s economy after WWII, Li Ming partnered with SGE, <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>Lehman</italic>, and <italic>Rockefeller</italic> by forming <italic>China Industries</italic> in New York in 1945. However, political turmoil in China led to the postponement of these plans when Li Ming returned to China in 1946. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Soviet Communist Party</italic> (\u201cSCP\u201d) replaced government bonds by centralizing state banks into BSU<italic> </italic>as the primary source of credit for <italic>state-owned enterprises</italic> (\u201cSOEs\u201d) and decentralized planning. BSU<italic> </italic>had the power to dis-bank <italic>state-owned enterprises</italic> (\u201cSOEs\u201d) for reasons of efficiency or politics, and was responsible for evaluating the success of SOEs in fulfilling their economic plan. While BSU<italic> </italic>censored over-production, SCP<italic> </italic>retained ultimate economic control. Without private trade risk, most insolvencies were handled politically rather than legally.\nSince the Soviet Union preferred not to finance trade deficits in gold, Western banks refused to give her credit. Instead of using an exchangeable currency for external trade, the Soviet Union relied on bartering energy resources, such as oil and gas, and later nuclear technology. After Yugoslavia stored gold with FRS <italic>New York</italic> as lend-lease supply collateral against Nazi invasion in 1941, America used the funds as a bargaining chip with the post-WWII Marxist regime in 1947.\nCapitalizing on China\u2019s chaos, native Hong Kong banks grew significant quickly. Ranging from small establishments to large institutions like <italic>Hang Seng Bank</italic>, native banks leveraged place-of-origin networks with banks and gold dealers in Portuguese Macao. Native banks attracted customers with higher interest rates and accepted collateral such as gold or American <italic>dollars</italic> valued at free market rates. As six native banks emerged as leaders\u2014<italic>Hang Seng</italic>, <italic>Dao Heng</italic>, <italic>Wing Lung</italic>, <italic>Wing Tai</italic>, <italic>Wing Hang</italic>, and <italic>Kwong On</italic>\u2014only a few experienced losses in the turbulent year of 1947, prompting <italic>Dao Heng </italic>partners to form <italic>Sun On</italic> to focus on gold and FX.\nBut as Chiang Kai-Shek turned against him, Li Ming dissolved <italic>China Industries</italic>, and fled to Hong Kong. As Mao Zedong led <italic>Chinese Communist Party</italic> (\u201cCCP\u201d) to power, forcing Chiang and his wife, May-ling Soong, to flee to Taiwan, Ai-ling Soong to America, and TV Soong to dissolve CDFC. While <italic>Sun On</italic> bank failed as CCP shuttered it in 1951, <italic>Hang Seng</italic> and HSBC established a global presence by expanding their branch networks and acquiring other banks, continuing to serve as correspondent for the smaller Hong Kong native banks. \nIn Taiwan, Chiang\u2019s autocratic government took over Japanese industries, including fertilizer and banks. Since TV Soong hired KY Yin as his secretary, the former <italic>Westinghouse</italic> engineer oversaw Taiwan\u2019s centralized stabilization programs and Chair of <italic>Bank of Taiwan</italic>. Like small private businesses struggled without capital, so did the government\u2019s centralized large-scale industries. So, America provided ECGD credit guarantees from 1954, reorienting Taiwan\u2019s exports from agricultural to industrialized technology. \nThe state in Taiwan owned major industries and the banking system, dominating sectors such as steel, heavy machinery, and semiconductors, contributing to almost half of the nation\u2019s gross domestic capital formation. This control ensured employment for specific follower groups and catered to military needs. Taiwan incentivized specific sectors like electronics and plastics through tax benefits and aid for exporters, mainly using public enterprises to foster sector development and exert significant leadership in crucial industries. \nMoreover, due to her small population and the lack of domestic markets, Taiwan did not go through a phase of import substitution.<italic> </italic>Entrepreneurs, lacking formal banking access, heavily relied on informal networks for capital, allowing successful businesses to evade state control. Despite high business dependence on the state, government agencies intervened less in individual firms compared to Korea.\nJames Chao was a schoolmate of Jiang Zemin, who became China\u2019s president in 1989. During the Communist takeover in 1949, James fled Shanghai for Taiwan. After marrying a fellow connected refugee, he moved to New York in 1956, and worked three jobs while in college before his wife and daughters arrived in 1961. That year, he established <italic>Foremost Shipping</italic> in New York, which soon secured government contracts to ship rice to Southeast Asia during the <italic>Vietnam War</italic>. James also continued his relationship Jiang and invested in a Chinese state-owned marine electronics manufacturer in the 1980s. Five of his daughters attended <italic>Harvard</italic>, who helped build his empire. \nSince America froze Chinese bank accounts, Mao\u2019s government deposited <italic>dollars</italic> into BSU\u2019s <italic>Narodny</italic> Paris. The middle Soong sister, Ching-ling, never remarried after Sun Yat-sen\u2019s death. Linking Mao to Sun from 1949, she chaired <italic>Sino-Soviet Friendship Association</italic>, winning honorary posts until her death. As a prominent labor leader in the 1920s, Chen Yu was appointed as the head of the <italic>Ministry of Fuel</italic>, responsible for overseeing the production and distribution of coal, electricity, and oil in 1949. He also served on the board of <italic>Bank of Communications</italic> and represented China in negotiations with Romania and the Soviet Union. In 1955, the <italic>Ministry of Fuel</italic> was restructured, and Chen assumed the ministerial post of the <italic>Ministry of Coal </italic>until he was replaced by a technocrat, Chang Lin-chih, in 1957.\nLike Ching-ling Soong, some women gained (at least the appearance of progressive) political power in Marxist Europe. The earliest female central bank chairs were at <italic>East German National of</italic>, mainly Margaretha Kuckhoff from 1950 to 1958, followed by Margarete Wittkowski from 1967 to 1974. And like the Soong family, Asian Christians and Marxists transformed Indochina.\nBack in the 1920s, the French industrialized northern Indochina, including the major coal basin in Southeast Asia. However, deflation from 1929 led Vietnamese and European protestors to blame <italic>Indochine</italic> for their misfortunes, turning to Communism while looting government offices, burning tax records, and murdering officials. The Viet Minh, led by Ho Chi Minh, gained significant support among coal miners, urban workers, industrial workers, and peasants in the region, bolstered by backing from the Soviet Union and China. \nNear the end of WWII, General Charles Gaulle sent Jean Sainteny\u2014<italic>Indchine</italic> banker, Albert Sarraut\u2019s son-in-law, and French Resistance fighter\u2014to negotiate independence with Ho Chi Minh. In 1946, Sainteny signed a preliminary agreement with Ho, recognizing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a free state within the French Union. However, this agreement broke down by the end of the year, leading to the outbreak of war.\nDuring French control, Emperor Bao Dai ruled in Annam, and Ngo Dinh Diem, who was born into the elite bureaucracy of Annam, served in various bureaucratic roles. Diem, combining Confucianism with Catholicism, chose a bureaucratic career rather than entering the Church. He rejected offers to become Prime Minister under Bao Dai in 1945 and 1949, and he also declined Ho Chi Minh\u2019s invitation to join the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1946 due to personal distrust, including the killing of one of his brothers and being held under duress by the Viet Minh. \nIn 1951, North Vietnam established <italic>North Vietnam</italic><italic>ese</italic><italic> </italic><italic>National Bank</italic>, bypassing <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s currency monopoly. Between 1953 and 1956, North Vietnam conducted land reforms across 3,314 villages in seventeen provinces, redistributing over 700,000 hectares of land to 1.5 million peasant families. The rise of communism in North Vietnam heightened fears among Catholics and the Chinese community\u2014which was more active in commerce and wealthier than the average Vietnamese\u2014who fled to South Vietnam. \nIn 1955, Ngo Dinh Diem established the Republic of Vietnam, becoming its first President. His regime, heavily supported by America, was characterized by autocratic governance and nepotism. Diem\u2019s brothers held significant roles: Nhu led the Can Lao Party and its secret police, while Thuc was the Archbishop of Hue. Diem\u2019s policies favored the Catholic minority, which exacerbated tensions with the predominantly Buddhist population. Diem\u2019s refusal to permit direct American military intervention allowed Ho Chi Minh to consolidate opposition without an early decisive conflict.\nAlso in 1955, Diem abolished <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s right to issue currency and established the government-owned <italic>South Vietnam</italic><italic>ese</italic><italic> </italic><italic>National Bank</italic>. Foiling takeover attempts by <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Indochine</italic> reallocated assets to France and Africa. Diem\u2019s <italic>National Bank </italic>replaced old currency, supervised private banks, and managed foreign trade financing and reserves from foreign aid. Diem\u2019s policies emphasized state ownership and control. By 1957, South Vietnam began controlling foreign enterprises, establishing entities such as <italic>Vietnam</italic> <italic>Sugar </italic>and <italic>Tan Mai Sawmill</italic>. Foreign investment reached $51.6 million within a decade, including paper mills and a glass factory.\nMeanwhile, following the <italic>Panic of 1953</italic>, TA1954 overhauled the tax code in America and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London renewed the <italic>London Gold Pool</italic>. Both spurred mining, particularly <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> and <italic>AMAX</italic> in Africa and Andr\u00e9 Meyer\u2019s <italic>MINERAL</italic> in America. While continuing non-stock reorgs, TA1954 codified NOC transfers for taxable sales\u2014with a business continuation test to curb tax mergers\u2014and GUD to exempt non-cash distributions to shareholders from corporate taxes. TA1954 returned tax benefits to spin-offs and allowed for tax basis reduction without BA1938\u2019s unsoundness condition. \nSince the textile slump during the <italic>Panic of 1948</italic><italic> </italic>and the cotton deflation following the <italic>Korean War</italic>, Royal Little decided that <italic>Textron</italic> would continue seeking merger opportunities, but not exclusively in textiles to diversify <italic>Textron</italic> as a conglomerate. Over antitrust concerns, TA1954 precipitated tax-loss fueled consolidation as textiles merged to combine NOCs. To compete with cheap Southern electricity, two New England textiles merged into <italic>Berkshire Hathaway</italic> (\u201c<italic>Berkshire</italic>\u201d).\nGeorge Miller left <italic>Cravath</italic> to conglomerate <italic>Textron</italic> from rayon into aerospace and beyond. But as prices in concentrated industries fell, FTC prevented strong firm mergers and persecuted importers for resale price maintenance to protect small business. And the Court further stimulated creditors\u2019 benefit reorgs by allowing reorgs in cases without misconduct without SEC\u2019s management change required by BA1938. \nBut bankers played a limited role in nationalized industries. Since banks lost management oversight after BA1934 federalized reorgs, companies turned to <italic>McKinsey</italic> and other management consultants for organizational advice without credit. Since Marvin Bower joined <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 1933 and led its transformation into a top management consulting firm in America. In 1952, under Bower\u2019s leadership, <italic>McKinsey</italic> was selected by President Eisenhower\u2019s administration to reorg the Defense Department, cementing the firm\u2019s reputation in government consulting. One of <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s first MBA hires was John Macomber. Not closely related to Boston banker John Macomber, John\u2019s grandfather was a New York State Court judge who married John Morgan\u2019s fourth cousin once removed. John graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> Business, joined <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 1953, married John Morgan\u2019s second great niece in 1955. \nArch Patton was<italic> </italic><italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s most profitable partner of the era. Using an executive compensation survey for <italic>General </italic><italic>Motor</italic> across 37 major companies, his findings, published in <italic>Fortune</italic> and <italic>Harvard Business Review </italic>in 1951, demonstrated that management wages had not kept pace with worker wages. This data prompted a strong interest in Patton\u2019s consulting services, leading to his involvement in advising on executive pay packages, including stock options for <italic>Pan American Airways</italic>. As Patton\u2019s work accounted for nearly 10% of <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s billings, Patton authored dozens of books and articles on compensation over the next two decades. In a book published in 1961, Patton argued that CEO compensation increased with company size, spurring companies to engage in M&A. By the mid-1980s, Patton admitted his work escalated stock options, executive pay, and income inequality.\nAlthough Congress avoided tax deductions to working and widowed mothers for childcare expenses to promote male employment, TA1954 extended this privilege for the first time. Since the Court had condoned \u2018separate but equal\u2019 for Black Americans in 1896, DOJ urged desegregation to aid foreign policy. As the Court desegrated public schools in 1954, Congress reformed civil rights. While 90% of Blacks lived in South before the 1930s, the <italic>Panic of 1953</italic> squeezed Blacks, and many migrated to Northern cities. Most Southern Senators opposed the Court\u2019s 1954 decision by signing the Southern Manifesto. Only senators Albert Gore of Tennessee, Estes Kefauver of Tennessee, and Lyndon Johnson of Texas did not sign the manifesto.\nAs New Deal labor laws heightened labor expenses, industries such as textiles and garments to consolidate or mechanize. In the steel sector, escalating labor expenditures coincided with reduced exports and increased imports from low-cost European laborers. Automation and overseas relocation hit Black workers disproportionately. Unlike White workers that came before them or the new immigrants, Black workers rejected sweatshops with support from White unions.\nHowever, the credit freeze of 1955 in Mississippi was artificial. In response to integration efforts, <italic>White Citizens Council</italic> sought to push Black property owners into foreclosure. Black fraternal organizations, including <italic>Knights & Daughters of Tabor</italic>, <italic>Afro-American Sons & Daughters</italic>, and <italic>Prince Hall Free Maso</italic>ns each contributed $250,000 to Tri State <italic>Bank </italic>of Memphis. Amidst ongoing economic challenges in 1956, a coalition including <italic>Knights & Daughters of Tabor</italic> and <italic>Mound Bayou American Legion</italic> collectively organized a drive to alleviate to financial hardship for farmers and laborers. That year, President Eisenhower appointed <italic>Universal </italic>LIC President Maceo Walker to the only Black on the <italic>Person-to-Person Committee</italic> to foster international through education.\nLikewise, Birmingham, Alabama, saw her first Black-owned bank since <italic>Penny Prudential</italic> <italic>Savings</italic> failed in 1915. In 1923, Arthur Gaston founded <italic>Booker Washington </italic><italic>Penny Savings Bank</italic> <italic>Burial Society</italic>, which grew into an insurer in the 1930s. Along with diversifying into a cemetery, chain of funeral homes, and a motel, he parlayed his wealth into civil rights. Gaston threatened to close his account unless the White-owned <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Birmingham</italic> removed the \u2018Whites Only\u2019 signs from its drinking fountain, which they did promptly to keep his business. \nTo extend mortgage access for Blacks, he sought to open Alabama\u2019s first Black-owned banking institution. After Birmingham banks opposed the plan, Gaston appealed to FHLBB, and received approval. In 1957, he raised deposits, mostly from Black churches, and chartered <italic>Citizens Federal</italic> S&L. In 1958, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr made a deposit and joined the bank\u2019s board.\nAmidst the prolonged recession, <italic>Morgan </italic>NB\u2019s Henry Alexander advocated for a temporary reduction in income taxes to spur recovery. As small businesses were slow to recover from the <italic>Panic of 1953</italic>, TA1958 extended NOCs, write-offs for original stockholders of depreciated stock, and <italic>S-corps</italic> allowing partnership-like pass-through for tightly held corporations. Moreover, Congress founded the  (\u201cSBA\u201d) for public-private venture capital, and SEC reiterated small business securities exemption for SA1933 disclosures. So, unlisted electronics initial public offerings boomed. Unlike NYSE\u2019s listed stock auctions, OTC brokers actively marketed unlisted stocks from their inventory. \nA confidence crisis in 1955 forced BOE to hike rates sharply. Amidst dollar shortage, <italic>Midland</italic> made <italic>dollar</italic> credit on gold against <italic>Bretton Woods</italic>. By 1957, Britain restricted London banks from financing third-party trade with <italic>pounds</italic>. As gold brokers <italic>Sharp</italic> and <italic>Pixley</italic> merged that year, merchant bank <italic>Hambro</italic> bought <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic>. \nAlthough they lost BOE board seats since nationalization in 1946, Lazard <italic>London</italic>\u2019s Kindersley and <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s Keswick were embroiled in a scandal as they were unaware of rate hikes or <italic>Exchequer</italic> debt sales while hunting Scottish game as overseas firms ran from <italic>pounds</italic> deposited with London merchant banks. So, Clore and other <italic>secondaries</italic> grew faster than BOE\u2019s cartel. Unlike regulated clearing banks, <italic>secondaries</italic> dealt residential property, leased, and lent second mortgages by using MMEU, repos, CDs, and paying higher rates.\nAs banking liberalized under nationalized BOE, so did takeovers as merchant banks invested in metal miners. Since Siegmund Warburg converted his uncle\u2019s metal trader <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt </italic>and sold a controlling stake to <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> in 1946, he bought a nationalized railway company in 1954, that he used as a shell to form <italic>Mercury Securities </italic>and acquire <italic>Warburg </italic>London and subsequently <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt</italic>. \nSince <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic>\u2019s Ludwig Vogelstein, the son of a leading reform rabbi in Stettin, started <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic> America in the 1880s, the company fused with <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> America into <italic>AMAX</italic><italic> </italic>during WWI. While Ludwig\u2019s brother worked in <italic>Warburg</italic>-affiliated <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Berlin from the 1920s, his nephew Hans Vogelstein ascended at AMAX, becoming President in 1957. Back in 1953, Andr\u00e9 Meyer hired Hans\u2019 son John\u2014a childhood friend of Felix Rohatyn\u2014to curry favor with <italic>AMAX</italic>.\nThere was also a generational divide between bankers. While Andr\u00e9 Meyer was 53 and Siegmund Warburg was 49 in 1951, most of the merchant bankers in key positions were older. Baron Vivian Smyth, the Chair of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>, was 84. At <italic>Baring</italic>, the second senior director, Edward Peacock, was 80, while Senior Director Arthur Villers was nearly 70. <italic>Lazard</italic> London Chair Baron Kindersley was 80 and his colleague Baron Brand was 73. <italic>Wagg</italic>\u2019s Alfred Wagg was 74.\nIn America, since <italic>COALH</italic> bought Mellon\u2019s <italic>Pittsburg Coal</italic> in 1945, becoming the nation\u2019s largest colliery, the Mellons merged <italic>Mellon Securities</italic> into <italic>First Boston</italic>, they gained non-voting shares and aligned with Rockefeller and Boston financial interests. With the largest capital in America, <italic>First Boston</italic> assuming investment banking for <italic>ALUM</italic> other Mellon companies. Since<italic> Kuhn-</italic>heir Joseph Loeb\u2019s stepson joined <italic>First Boston</italic> London as Chair in 1935, Seligman cousin Robert Mayer, a former <italic>AMAX</italic> executive, took over from 1949. (Another bank director was a Rothschild and Morgan cousin.) \nThrough WWII, <italic>ALUM</italic> accepted <italic>Kaiser</italic> and <italic>Reynolds</italic> as aluminum producers, though <italic>ALUM</italic> set prices. While <italic>ALUM</italic> dominated aluminum as AA1914 prohibited prevented industrial mergers.  Since FDR packed the Court with \u2018trustbusters\u2019, DOJ failed to dissolve <italic>ALUM</italic> as justices recused themselves. \n<italic>ALUM</italic> assured Allied victory in WWII, but FDR privatized wartime Caribbean aluminum for competition, allowing <italic>ALUM</italic> to win against DOJ in 1951. Likewise, <italic>Kaiser</italic> turned to <italic>First Boston</italic> for financing. By 1953, <italic>Mellon</italic> NB acted as trustee, and <italic>First Boston</italic> underwrote all of <italic>Kaiser</italic>\u2019s bonds. The following year, Andrew Mellon\u2019s granddaughter, whose father was the British ambassador, married Edward Schiff Warburg\u2019s Prue nephew. And in 1956, a Rockefeller married a <italic>First Boston</italic> heiress.\nMeanwhile, <italic>British Aluminum</italic> (\u201cBA\u201d) had overextended investments in Canada, British Guiana, and Australia. Despite this, the \u2018gentlemanly\u2019 style of business insulated market pressure from BA, which was led by the political establishment, including Geoffrey Cunliffe, whose father had led BOE during WWI. In 1955, <italic>Warburg</italic> London, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and <italic>First Boston</italic> formed <italic>Transoceanic Development</italic> in Canada and began buying BA shares to fuse with <italic>AMAX</italic>. \nWhile BA\u2019s banker, <italic>Lazard</italic> London, refused to sell her shares, America\u2019s <italic>Reynolds Metal </italic>looked to expand and set her sights on BA as well. <italic>Reynolds</italic>\u2019 advisor <italic>Kuhn</italic> recommended they go through <italic>Warburg</italic> to avoid antagonizing British nationalism with an outright American bid. While alerting BOE, <italic>Warburg</italic> then convinced British<italic> Tube Investments</italic> to join <italic>Reynolds</italic> to secretly buy BA shares. \nMoreover, as BOE imposed an indefinite waiting period to join the Accepting Houses Committee for access to bill rediscounting, <italic>Warburg</italic> bypassed this by acquiring <italic>Seligman</italic> London and inheriting their privileges. This transaction also reinforced the linkages with Seligman cousin Robert Mayer, a former <italic>AMAX</italic> executive who took over the chairmanship of <italic>First Boston</italic> London from <italic>Kuhn-</italic>heir Joseph Loeb\u2019s stepson in 1949.\nBy 1958, <italic>Warburg</italic> approached BA for a friendly merger, but BA refused. As <italic>Warburg</italic> launched a public hostile takeover campaign, <italic>Lazard </italic>London recruited <italic>Alcoa</italic> for a white knight bid for BA. Brokers <italic>Cazenove</italic> and <italic>Rowe </italic><italic>Pitman</italic> were initially neutral but sided with BA after pressure from <italic>Lazard </italic>and <italic>Hambro</italic>. Despite opposition from fifteen allies, including <italic>Brown Shipley</italic>, <italic>Samuel Montagu</italic>, and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>, <italic>Exchequer</italic> did not support the <italic>Alcoa</italic> deal. As BOE Governor Cobbold intervened to mediate the situation, <italic>Warburg</italic> with the support of <italic>Tube</italic>\u2019s advisors <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Wagg</italic> won approval from BOE and investors with a higher bid and continued British ownership of BA. \nStill, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> refused to work with <italic>Warburg</italic> for 15 years afterward. Instead, <italic>Warburg</italic> re-enforced relations with metal and bankers from Germany and America. In 1962, <italic>Warburg</italic> partner Henry Gr\u00fcnfeld\u2014from a pre-WWII German family connected to Upper Silesian mining and BGGE\u2014saw his daughter marry a Lewisohn, an extended cousin of the Warburgs through the Goldschmidts and a second cousin once removed to <italic>COPPER</italic> founder\u2019s Adolph Lewisohn, through him he was connected to Lehman and <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Benjamin Buttenwieser. \nLikewise, the families reconnected. After failed approaches to American firms, Lang Hancock\u2014a cousin of the aristocratic Leigh-Pemberton family connected to <italic>Westminster</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2014secured interest from <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>, which led to the formation of <italic>Conzinc Rio Tinto</italic> of Australia with <italic>Kaiser </italic>and grew <italic>Hancock</italic><italic> Prospecting </italic>into Australia\u2019s largest iron miner.\nBecause of WWII\u2019s lend-lease, BSU made loans in America using <italic>Narodny </italic>New York<italic>.</italic> As the Soviet Union quashed Hungary\u2019s revolt in 1956,<italic> Narodny</italic> moved <italic>dollars</italic> from her New York branch<italic> </italic>to London with the aid of <italic>Chase</italic>. Having used <italic>Narodny</italic>, <italic>Kleinwort</italic>, sent <italic>dollars</italic> to <italic>Bank of London & South America </italic>(\u201cBOLSA\u201d), a subsidiary of <italic>Lloyd</italic>, in 1957 as BOE imposed restrictions on the way in which the <italic>pound</italic> could be used to finance international trade. Soon after, core BOLSA shareholder <italic>Benson</italic>, cousins of Grenfell, hired George Pinto, whose mother was a Seligman, sister married Simon Marks, and aunt wed James Rothschild.\nSince the <italic>London Gold Pool</italic> established in 1954, central banks converted inflating <italic>dollars</italic> into gold. As gold left America, FRS raised official reserves and bought gold in the market to offset losses from 1958. While other European central banks resumed convertibility, BOE did not. Instead, Britain allowed banks to develop the <italic>Euromarket</italic> (\u201cMMEU\u201d) to settle <italic>dollar</italic> debts in gold. To curb inflation, FRS reduced monetary expansion from September 1959, while also allowing banks to count vault cash as reserves for the first time since 1917. \nSecurities brokers increasingly branched internationally. In 1957, <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> Paris open under the leadership of Baron Pierre Neufville, whose cousin once removed had married a Pereire, related to the Mirabauds. After <italic>Erlanger</italic> merged in 1959 with <italic>Hill Higginson</italic> of London, they bought a minority interest in <italic>Harriman Ripley</italic>, leading <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> to form \u2018<italic>Paribas by Lehman</italic>\u2019 in New York by 1960. This was a departure from the norm, as foreign-owned investment banks rarely entered America. \nAlthough <italic>Lazard</italic> New York had long been America\u2019s French bank, the<italic> Lazard</italic> Paris and Lehman-cousin funding reflected growing financial ties between the European community and America, with the new firm facilitating trades, floating European securities, and distributing new securities by American companies. The same year, <italic>Kleinwort</italic> merged with core BOLSA shareholder <italic>Benson</italic> to lead British investment banking as <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic>. Likewise, BOLSA grew closer to <italic>Warburg</italic>. While <italic>Stein</italic>\u2019s septuagenarian Chair Edward Stein had joined <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s clique against <italic>Warburg</italic>, the failure led him to sell <italic>Stein</italic> to <italic>Lazard</italic> London.\nLikewise, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> went public in September 1959, with the family retaining half of the equity and the New York operations most of the book value, Helmut Schr\u00f6der\u2019s declining health led his son Bruno to join the family business. After graduating <italic>Eton</italic>, <italic>Oxford</italic>, and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business, he worked in internal audit, commercial banking, and corporate finance and was appointed non-executive director of <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> in 1963. To lead as Deputy Chair from 1962, however, <italic>Schr\u00f6der </italic>promoted Gordon Richardson, who been hired from the <italic>Lazard</italic> London-promoted <italic>Industrial & Commercial Finance Corp</italic> in 1957. He became Chair soon after.\nHaving advised <italic>Tube Investments</italic>\u2019 together, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Wagg</italic> grew closer. Since the retirement of Moses Montefiore in the 1830s, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London retained <italic>Wagg</italic> as stockbrokers. While his uncle married Montefiore\u2019s sister-in-law, Hart cousin John Wagg started <italic>Wagg</italic> in 1823. By 1836, he married Montefiore\u2019s niece, who was the daughter of Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s son and Katz descendant Hannah Samuel. While their son wed a Merton who descended from Samson Wertheim, they left Judaism. In 1960, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Wagg</italic> established a JV in Australia. John Darling, from a prominent Australian business family, became the local partner, along with other local participants like <italic>Bank of New South Wales</italic>, <italic>Binder Hamlyn</italic>, and <italic>Jardine</italic>. With <italic>Wagg</italic> and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> investment <italic>Darling</italic> opened an office in Sydney and soon expanded to Melbourne and Perth. By 1962, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Wagg</italic> merged. \nIn 1959, <italic>Royal Dutch Shell</italic> sought consultancy services that would avoid bias towards either British or Dutch interests, given <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s dual-national structure. Through the CEO of <italic>Texas Instruments</italic> in New York, <italic>Shell</italic> engaged <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Marvin Bower. <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s initial assignment for <italic>Shell</italic> was in Venezuela. Following the success of this project, Shell requested McKinsey\u2019s expertise for their European operations. In response, <italic>McKinsey</italic> opened her first overseas office in London in 1959, led by Hugh Parker. Macomber, who had worked on the <italic>Shell</italic> assignment in Venezuela, became head of <italic>McKinsey</italic> in Continental Europe and was instrumental in establishing offices. By 1961, <italic>McKinsey</italic> opened an office in Geneva, followed by Paris, D\u00fcsseldorf, Amsterdam, Brussels, and Milan soon after. \nSoon serving KLM <italic>Airlines</italic>, <italic>Imperial Chemical Industries</italic>, <italic>Vickers</italic>, <italic>British Petroleum</italic>, <italic>Unilever</italic>, the shipyards, the steel works, <italic>British Post Office</italic>, <italic>Rolls Royce</italic>, <italic>United Biscuits</italic>, and BBC in Britain, <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s expansion into France included aluminum and chemicals producer <italic>Pechiney</italic>, cement manufacturer <italic>Lafarge</italic>, <italic>Renault</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, and <italic>Rh\u00e9ne-Poulenc</italic>. Along with <italic>Volkswagen</italic> in Germany, McKinsey\u2019s Swiss clients included <italic>Geigy</italic>, <italic>Nestl\u00e9</italic>, <italic>Sandoz</italic>, and <italic>Union Bank</italic>. Likewise, <italic>McKinsey</italic> advised IBM and other American investors in Europe.\nMeanwhile, energy and antitrust came together in the South. Since 1953, former <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner Lewis Strauss-Darmstadt severed as Chair of AEC. However, his strong support for the hydrogen bomb against the Soviet Union created a divide with Robert Oppenheimer. Backed by Strauss-Darmstadt, AEC held hearings into Oppenheimer\u2019s alleged Communist ties and security risks relating to his opposition to the bomb in 1954, which resulted in the revocation of his security clearance. \nConcurrently, the South\u2019s primary coal buyer, TVA, faced limitations in expanding its energy production to service AEC and the South with cheap energy without Congress\u2019 approval. So, in 1954, the Eisenhower Administration permitted AEC in Memphis to purchase private energy from Arkansas through the private Dixon-Yates consortium, with advice from <italic>First Boston</italic> and <italic>Sullivan</italic>. \nWhile Memphis sought to build a public plant, <italic>First Boston</italic> advised the Budget Bureau, Strauss-Darmstadt advanced the contract over the dissent of Commissioners. Budget Directors Joseph Dodge and Rowland Hughes, with prior roles at <italic>Detroit Bank & Trust</italic> and <italic>Citi</italic>, supported the project. SEC Chairman Ralph Demmler, from the Mellon-connected law firm <italic>Reed Smith Shaw</italic> <italic>McClay</italic>, also backed it. Following congressional investigations and criticism of <italic>First Boston</italic>\u2019s dual role, AEC canceled the contract and resumed power purchases from TVA in 1955.\nAround the same time, Cyrus Eaton initiated the acquisition of Kentucky PU and coal assets. Already selling cattle to the Soviet Union, advocated for closer relations to promote peace after the Soviet Union suppressed the Hungarian uprising with tanks in 1956. While Eaton received subsidies for his Kentucky coal from <italic>LABOR</italic> and L&N RR, Congress rejected Eisenhower\u2019s nomination of Strauss-Darmstadt as Commerce Secretary in 1958. \nThe Soviet Union recognized Eaton\u2019s efforts towards peace by awarding him the <italic>Lenin Peace</italic> prize in 1960. However, Eaton faced legal action in the form of an antitrust lawsuit filed by sixteen small Tennessee coal mines against him, <italic>LABOR</italic>, TVA, and L&N. As a result of this lawsuit, TVA shifted its focus from geographical expansion to vertical coal integration. This change in priority allowed TVA to consolidate its coal operations and streamline its production process. \nAmerican antitrust continued to steer energy policy. After Eisenhower became president in 1953, DOJ sued the oil majors and obtained numerous documents related to their operations and intercompany dealings. With resistance from <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Dean, negotiations began during Eisenhower\u2019s second term but were not completed before Foster Dulles died in 1959. Ultimately, the oil companies settled and agreed to end collusive activities shortly after the Eisenhower administration\u2019s end. Moreover, Congress promoted North American trade with import quotas on overseas oil, subsidizing independent refiners at the cost of integrated majors in 1959. As America paid above market prices, Saudi Arabia cartelized producers into <italic>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</italic> (\u201cOPEC\u201d).\nAlthough the <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> of 1951 that created ECSC to regulate the steel industry against German concentration, the <italic>Treaty of Rome</italic> of 1957 created EEC to reducing barriers to trade and increasing competition. At the same time, created <italic>Euratom</italic> for a single market for nuclear materials and technology. Following up on <italic>BANK</italic>\u2019s <italic>International</italic> <italic>Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> (\u201cIBRD\u201d) of 1945 and <italic>International Finance Corp</italic> (\u201cIFC\u201d) of 1956, EEC created <italic>European Investment Bank</italic> in 1958.\nAs gold continued to leave the country during the <italic>Panic of 1960</italic>, shortages intensified, and the price of gold rose above $35 per ounce. After advising the President to extend for the ban on private gold ownership to American banks abroad, <italic>Morgan </italic>NB Chair Alexander urged repeal of UST\u2019s requirement for holding a 25% gold reserve against FRS notes and deposits. \nFRS also allowed banks to hold vault cash as reserves and further relaxed guidelines. But as SGE sought to exit Latin America, Mexico nationalized most PUs. Despite liquidity needs, banks stigmatized counterparties that paid above market MMFR rates. Then, a court extended SA1933 registration to sales of post-default secured collateral and  required DOJ approval for uninsured bank mergers. Moreover, Congress shifted FRS\u2019 goal from price stability to employment.\nIn 1961, <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Walter Wriston introduced negotiable certificates of deposit (\u201cCDs\u201d) to manage liabilities. As a UST bond broker developed MMCD using repo, FRS raised <italic>Reg Q</italic> bank deposit ceilings and lowered CD reserve requirements. By yearend, America and the <italic>European Economic Community</italic> (\u201cEEC\u201d) joined Britain in the <italic>London Gold Pool</italic> to sell gold and stabilize the price at $35 per ounce. But <italic>dollar</italic> inflation continued until the price of gold surpassed $40 per ounce in London.\nTo stimulate the economy with easier monetary policy without worsening the balance of payments and gold outflows, UST and FRS began <italic>Operation Twist </italic>in February 1961. The program reduced short-term yields as UST pivoting to issuing short-term securities and FRS bought longer-term UST securities. As FRS began trading in FX with intention on stopping MMEU after the <italic>Panic of 1960</italic>, Swiss and French interest bans to foreigners, grew MMEU until the recession drove Western banks to <italic>Narodny </italic>London\u2019s low rates. As stockbrokers switched to financial and European securities by 1961, their European counterparts followed. \nAs growing mutual funds and pension funds increased and accelerated equities trades from the 1960s, <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Gustave Levy, <italic>Bear</italic>\u2019s Cy Lewis, and <italic>Salomon</italic>\u2019s Jay Perry<italic> </italic>used firm capital to take the other side of large stock block OTC trades, at a single price like bonds. Since <italic>Lehman</italic> did not a trading department since splitting for <italic>Goldman</italic>, they hired most of <italic>Becker</italic>\u2019s CP staff led by Lewis Glucksman in 1962.\nAfter Eisenhower promoted Dillon under the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs to unify foreign aid policies in 1957. By 1960, Dillon helped re-negotiate GATT between EEC and developing countries, replaced the <italic>Marshall Plan</italic> with the <italic>Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development</italic> (\u201cOECD\u201d), and coordinated with IMF and EXIM to ease balance-of-payments crises in Latin America. New international financial banks included <italic>Inter-American Development Bank</italic> 1959; and <italic>Central American Bank for Economic Integration</italic> in 1961. Likewise, EEC expanded from standard of living investments in southern Italy to funding Greece and Turkey by 1962. \nMeanwhile, MMEU also helped French merchant banks compete with nationalized deposit banks. While <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, and <italic>Paribas</italic> merchant banks focused on international alliances, nationalized deposit banks like <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, had holdings within France. Since joining <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1925, Franco-Hispanic Jean Reyre became CEO in 1948. <italic>Lazard</italic> partnered with <italic>Indochine</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Suisse</italic> in 1952 to create <italic>Canadera</italic>, an investment firm in Canada. After years quietly accumulating <italic>Paribas</italic> shares for years through discreet agreements and alliances, notably with <italic>Indochine</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> became aggressive in 1954. \nWith <italic>Lazard</italic> and her ally holding a substantial portion of <italic>Paribas</italic> shares, they demanded board seats. <italic>Paribas</italic> tried to counter but failed. Soon after, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris<italic> </italic>pushed <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 two directors of <italic>Denis</italic> off the board. <italic>Lazard</italic> downplayed it, having reaffirmed their banking presence, earning profits by selling acquired shares, and developing an informal alliance formed among <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Indochine</italic>. By 1960, <italic>Paribas</italic> yielded <italic>Chinoise</italic> to <italic>Indochine</italic>. After supporting gradual colonial liberalization as Minister of Overseas France, Louis Jacquinot married Simone Goldschmidt Lazard and rose to Minister of State.\nThe first wave of investment focused domestically. After the discovery of the Parentis field in 1954 and the liberalization of petroleum regulations, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Commercial Credit of France</italic>, <italic>Parisienne</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Shell</italic>, and <italic>OIL</italic> founded FINAREP to finance oil exploration. In 1955, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Worms</italic>, and <italic>Comptoir</italic> created COFIREP as a rival venture. \nFollowing oil inflation from Egypt\u2019s closure of <italic>Suez</italic> <italic>Canal</italic> in the <italic>Panic of 1956</italic>, France accelerated domestic and African oil and mining projects. In 1957, <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris founded COFIMER to fund resource extraction in the Franc Zone, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris founded <italic>French Petroleum Investment Co</italic> to consolidate control over energy and raw material investments, and EURAFREP, controlled by <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, Indochine, BGGE, with <italic>Solvay</italic>\u2019s Ren\u00e9 Bo\u00ebl as a director, began operations in Saharan oil exploitation.\nJacques Fouchier led COFIMER in 1959. He began his career as a civil servant, serving as Inspector of Finance in 1934 and but resigned from being <italic>Ministry of Finance</italic> after Laval\u2019s speech favoring German victory and joined the Free French army in 1942. In 1946, he tapped the capital markets to found consumer and mortgage finance companies with equity from <italic>Parisienne</italic>, which he consolidated under <italic>Co Bancaire</italic> in 1959, which became <italic>Parisienne</italic>\u2019s largest borrower. His brother Louis joined <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Nord</italic>, rising from attach\u00e9 in 1964 to CEO. As Jacques become VP and President of <italic>Paribas</italic><italic> </italic>between 1967 and 1969, Louis linked <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Nord</italic> to <italic>Paribas</italic>.\nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1960</italic>, French oil companies invested in newly independent African countries to diversify supply and build political alliance with less rigid supervisions as former Vichy Chief of Police and Nazi collaborator Ren\u00e9 Bousquet rose from <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s technical advisor to Deputy General Manager in 1960 and served on colonial boards, including <italic>G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Mines</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier de la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie</italic>, and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Plantations R\u00e9unies de l</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Ouest Africain</italic>. In 1968, <italic>French Petroleum </italic>split, with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 <italic>Nord</italic> acquiring FRANCAREP<italic> </italic>with <italic>Worms</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier Industriel</italic> (\u201cSOVAC\u201d) buying EURAFREP with <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Indochine</italic>, BGGE, and <italic>Solvay</italic>.\nLikewise, <italic>Morgan </italic>interests sought to engage internationally. Despite historical ties to Paris, restrictions following incorporation in 1945 limited <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s participation in underwriting. While <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> were keen for a new bank, BOE withheld approval due to exchange control regulations. Persistence led to a revised proposal in 1962, securing permission for a 30% stake in the new <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris. \nWhile the venture clashed in Germany and Switzerland over financial autonomy with <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>\u2019s intervention and collaboration averted a crisis, and <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris thrived independently, managing numerous international MMEU debt issues. Likewise, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>, in collaboration with <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic>, provided acceptance credits and organized issuances for Irish companies, cultivating a partnership with <italic>Bank of Ireland</italic>. This collaboration led to the joint acquisition, alongside <italic>Commercial Bank of Scotland</italic> (future <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic>), of <italic>National Bank</italic>.\nSince James Byrne became <italic>Harvard</italic>\u2019s first Catholic Overseer in 1920, Congressman John Kennedy joined in 1957. While Joseph Kennedy\u2019s son John inherited some of his of <italic>Kennedy </italic>fortune<italic>,</italic> the Congressman\u2019s social network greatly enhanced by his marriage to Jacqueline Bouvier. While her maternal grandfather constructed luxury New York apartments in the 1920s before becoming a <italic>Chase</italic> NB director, her paternal grandfather Vernon Bouvier\u2014a Catholic nephew-in-law of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s partner Anthony Drexel\u2014was a prominent LIC attorney. Her father was an independent NYSE broker, but her mother divorced him to marry <italic>OIL</italic> heir and broker <italic>Auchincloss Parker Redpath</italic> founder Hugh Auchincloss by 1943. And in 1959, Jacqueline\u2019s sister married Prince Radziwill. Although few of these socialite marriages lasted, they attracted public attention. \nIn Fayette County and other majority Black rural communities in Tennessee, minority White rule had dominated government and commerce until civil rights advocates voter registration campaigns of the 1960 election to elect Black officials. Simultaneously, the White minority, pressured by Federal Court writs, staunchly opposed these efforts, leading local grocery stores, banks, and gas stations to resort to blacklists. Out of Memphis, <italic>Universal </italic>LIC and <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> employed their facilities for planning local sit-ins and offering bail funds to protesters. <italic>Harvard</italic> Business, meanwhile, considered Southern White males to be affirmative action candidates, while continuing to limit access to Blacks, Jews, and women.\nSince Nathan Straus of <italic>Macy</italic> bought WMCA in 1943, his son, Peter, was the first to have WMCA endorse a presidential candidate, supporting John F. Kennedy in 1960. Defeating Richard Nixon, Democrat John Kennedy became President in 1961. As President Kennedy appointed his brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, as the first Director of the <italic>Peace Corps</italic> and his brother, Robert, as attorney general, Peter Straus served as a campaign manager for Robert\u2019s successful 1964 Senate run in New York. Around the same time, Goodyear and Havemeyer heirs wed the children of Democrat icon FDR\u2019s son with Ethel DuPont.\nBankers heavily influenced President Kennedy\u2019s early foreign policy. When Kennedy became President in 1961, he consulted <italic>Brown Harriman</italic>\u2019s Robert Lovett, who had backed Nixon. Kennedy appointed Lovett\u2019s suggestion of Dean Rusk, President of <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic>, for Secretary of State. For Secretary of Defense, Kennedy selected Robert McNamara, President of <italic>Ford </italic><italic>Motor</italic>. McNamara\u2019s appointment was supported by <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Sidney Weinberg and <italic>Lehman</italic>, which had connections to <italic>Ford</italic>. \nDouglas Dillon, who had supported Nixon and was linked to <italic>Dillon</italic> and <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic>, became UST Secretary. McGeorge Bundy, an in-law of <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Dean Acheson affiliated with the Rockefeller-connected <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic>, was appointed National Security Adviser. Allen Dulles continued as CIA Director and played a key role in the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. \nEugene Black stayed on as President of <italic>BANK</italic> until 1962, when Rockefeller affiliated <italic>First Boston</italic>\u2019s George Woods took over. After Kennedy consolidated the various aid agencies into <italic>Agency for International Development</italic><italic> </italic>(\u201cUSAID\u201d), among the first hires<italic> </italic>were<italic> </italic><italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Rodney Wagner and Alex Vagliano. Henry Cabot Lodge, appointed Ambassador to South Vietnam in 1963, had ties to <italic>Morgan</italic>.\nFrustrated with South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem\u2019s inability to unite dissident groups against the growing communist threat, which consolidated under Ho Chi Minh as Diem refused to permit direct American military intervention, Kennedy allowed CIA to fund a coup encouraged by Ambassador Lodge. The resulting chaos led to Diem\u2019s assassination on November 2, 1963, shocking Kennedy, who was assassinated three weeks later. Under President Johnson, the American military increasingly intervened in Vietnam.\nIn late 1964, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara cited economic reasons in pulling military funds from the Brooklyn\u2019s Navy Yard and 94 other facilities. While Robert Kennedy and fellow New York Senator Jacob Javits to appeal to the President on humanitarian concerns, they shifted to the private sector. With a lack of mortgage credit for the deteriorating in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, Senator Kennedy spearheaded the development of Fulton Street shopping district in 1966. \nHe established <italic>Bed-Stuy Development & Services Corp</italic> and <italic>Bed-Stuy</italic> <italic>Renewal & Rehabilitation Corp</italic>, engaging <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Meyer and <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s George Moore. While Meyer had reservations, he played challenged Disque Deane and Felix Rohatyn to devise a solution: a $65 million mortgage pool that involved contributions from banks and LICs. Along with funding this project, <italic>Citi</italic> co-founded the <italic>Economic </italic><italic>Development Council</italic> with Mayor John Lindsay\u2014son of <italic>Speyer</italic> New York and <italic>Swiss American Corp</italic>\u2019s George Lindsay\u2014to design job opportunities for Black and Hispanic New Yorkers.\nFriendly relations with key pipelines eased <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s success. While <italic>Rockefeller</italic> and <italic>First Boston</italic> owned many of the pipes, they tipped the scale adding <italic>Shell</italic> and <italic>Dillon</italic>. Since <italic>Pearson</italic> sold his Mexican oil operations to <italic>Shell</italic> during WWI when investing in <italic>Lazard</italic> London, the latter had a large stake in <italic>Shell</italic>, while <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris was <italic>Shell</italic>\u2019s sole banker in France. Meyer had to gain favor from UST Secretary Dillon. \nAfter the pre-war banker directorates gave way to large corporations, oil-intensive companies associated with <italic>Dillon</italic> banked with <italic>New York Trust </italic>and <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic>. In 1946, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York hired Howard Kniffin, the Christian son-in-law of Ernest Stauffen, a director of <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> and Finance Committee Chair from 1950 until his death that year. \nStauffen\u2019s brother-in-law Kentucky-born Louis Stewart was a <italic>New York Trust</italic> VP and wed to a Vermilye descendant, from whose family bank <italic>Dillion</italic> formed. Of unknown relation to Charles, Texas-born Charles Stewart had transitioned from Dallas real estate to <italic>New York Trust</italic>\u2019s commercial banking in 1930, ascending to president by 1949. After failing to merge with <italic>Manufacturers Trust </italic>in 1952, Stewart became a <italic>Lazard</italic> New York partner.\nSince <italic>Anheuser</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Busch</italic>-in-law and Irish Catholic Horace Flanigan became a <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> VP in 1931, his son Peter son joined <italic>Dillion</italic> in 1947 and then took a secondment to help implement the <italic>Marshall Plan</italic> for the government in London. As he wed his daughter to Thomas Murray McDonnell in 1950, Horace Flanigan became Vice Chair of <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic>. The son of Irish Catholic <italic>McDonnell</italic> founder and the grandson of electric patentholder and <italic>Edison </italic>executive, Thomas\u2019 sisters had married Henry Ford II in 1940, Alfred Vanderbilt in 1945, and other cousins and in-laws were prominent at many other enterprises. \nWithin months, Thomas become Chair of <italic>McDonnell</italic>, managing <italic>Ford</italic>\u2019s pension assets as his brother-in-law became CEO. After Peter Flanigan returned to <italic>Dillon</italic> from his government secondment, <italic>Dillon </italic>became <italic>Anheuser-Busch</italic>\u2019s underwriter. Despite being a lay Catholic, McDonnell\u2019s became Chief Financial Adviser for New York\u2019s Archdiocese. He also cultivated the family\u2019s friendship with the fellow Irish Catholic Kennedys.\n<italic>First Boston</italic> partners also kinterlinked. After severing as a field artillery major during WWII, Paul Miller joined <italic>First Boston</italic> in 1946. In 1950, he married Adele Olyphant, a Vanderbilt descendant, and her father became Vice Chair of <italic>Guaranty </italic>NB. As Miller focused on industrial companies, cultivating strong business relationships, notably with Mellon\u2019s <italic>ALUM</italic> and various large Pittsburgh corporations, he progressed through the ranks at <italic>First Boston</italic>, overseeing its investment banking department and serving on its board.\nWhile Vanderbilts, Roosevelts, and other New York families governed <italic>Hanover Bank</italic> along with <italic>Dillon</italic>, <italic>Brown</italic>, and <italic>White Weld</italic> in the early 1930s, the investment bankers withdrew after SA1933 and the original members mostly departed by the 1940s, with their directorates were filled by executives from<italic> Chrysler</italic>, <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>, <italic>Union Carbide</italic>, and <italic>Continental Insurance</italic>. \nAfter WWII, Augustus Read, a grandson of <italic>Read</italic>\u2019s founder and former <italic>Dillion </italic>partner, returned to <italic>Hanover</italic>. In 1947, Read\u2019s son married a Joan Delano Redmon, whose father had been with <italic>US Trust Co</italic>, mother was a cousin of FDR, and sister wed a third great nephew of Thomas-Handasyd Perkins, whose uncle had been Chair of <italic>Citi</italic> until his death in 1940. \nLikewise, Southerners gained control of banking. Since John Snyder, the nephew of an Arkansas banker, attended <italic>Vanderbilt</italic> <italic>Uni</italic> and worked for banks near his home state, he became bank receiver at FDIC and RFC, and UST Secretary under President Truman from 1946 through 1953. By 1950, Tennessee-born lawyer Henry Alexander took over as the Head of <italic>Morgan </italic>NB from George Whitney and joined <italic>Vanderbilt</italic>\u2019s board alongside Harold Sterling Vanderbilt.\nSince graduating <italic>Vanderbilt </italic>in 1920, another Tennessean, Baxter Jackson, Nathaniel Baxter Jackson from <italic>Vanderbilt</italic>\u2014unrelated to President Andrew Jackson, but the great-nephew of Jere Baxter and nephew of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>\u2019s Robert Maddox\u2014became President of <italic>Chemical</italic> NB in 1946. Alongside, Kentucky-born Harold Helm had joined <italic>Chemical</italic> NB out of <italic>Princeton</italic> in 1920, rising becoming President in 1947 as Jackson became Chair. After Helm convinced Jackson to buy <italic>Corn Exchange Bank & Trust</italic> in 1954, he became Chair in 1956 upon Jackson\u2019s retirement<italic>.</italic>\nAfter President Truman, Eisenhower ascended the presidency in 1953, and replaced John Snyder with former <italic>COALH</italic> CEO George Humphrey, whose brother had married a daughter of Benjamin Strong, co-founder of <italic>Bankers Trust </italic>and former head of FRS <italic>New York</italic>. As Eisenhower appointed Winthrop Aldrich to Ambassador to Britain, <italic>Chase</italic> replaced him as Chair with Philadelphia-born John McCloy. \nGraduating from <italic>Amherst College</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law by 1921, McCloy worked for five years with <italic>Cadwalader</italic> before moving to <italic>Cravath</italic>, where he became a partner. By then, McCloy married Ellen Zinsser, whose grandfather immigrated from Baden, Germany, in 1849 and founded a chemical and dye business. Her cousin, John Zinsser, associated with <italic>Merck</italic> and presided over the Philadelphia pharmaceutical firm <italic>Sharp Dohme</italic>, married Joyce Knowlton of Brookline, Massachusetts. Joyce\u2019s brother, Hugh, worked at <italic>International Acceptance Bank </italic>and became a <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner in 1933 and married the sister of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Harold Stanley. McCloy\u2019s prominence drew the attention of Henry Stimson, leading to his appointment as Assistant Secretary of War in 1941, where he presided over the internment of Japanese descendants in detention centers. \nWhile his brother-in-law Lewis Douglas became Ambassador to Britain after WWII, McLoy secured Congressional approval for the <italic>Lend-Lease Act</italic>, he served as President of <italic>BANK</italic>\u2019s <italic>International Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> from 1947, High Commissioner for Germany from 1949. McCloy became a Partner at <italic>Milbank</italic> <italic>Tweed</italic> <italic>Hope</italic> <italic>Hadley</italic> <italic>McCloy</italic>, the law firm for the Rockefeller family and <italic>Chase</italic> NB. Along with chairing <italic>Chase</italic>, McCloy became Chair of the <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic> from 1953 and the <italic>Ford Foundation</italic> from 1958. By then Hugh Knowlton\u2019s daughter married the first cousin once removed of John Morgan\u2019s Satterlee son-in-law in 1949 and her brother joined <italic>Smith Barney </italic>in 1951.\nAfter WWII, <italic>Merck</italic> struggled with a lack of new drug innovations and intense competition. In 1953, <italic>Merck</italic> merged with <italic>Sharp Dohme</italic>, known for advancements in sulfa drugs, vaccines, and blood plasma products. This merger enhanced <italic>Merck</italic>\u2019s distribution and marketing capabilities, allowing it to market its drugs under its own name. \nFrom <italic>Sharp Dohme</italic> John Zinsser became Vice Chair of <italic>Merck</italic>. Before WWI, not closely connected to Boston Brahmins, George Perkins grew from <italic>New York</italic> LIC\u2019s Chicago branch clerk to board director while his father traded between New York and Chicago. The rouge Perkins left <italic>Morgan </italic>by 1910. Following the anti-German attitudes of WWI, the American subsidiary of German pharmaceutical <italic>Merck</italic> went public in 1919, and Perkins\u2019 son became COO as he married into that family. \nSince <italic>Morgan </italic>NB turned down a merger offer, <italic>Chase</italic> NB merged with <italic>Manhattan</italic> NB in 1955 to become the nation\u2019s third largest behind <italic>TransAmerica</italic> <italic>Bank of America </italic>NB<italic> </italic>and <italic>Citi</italic>, and soon under the leadership of <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s George Champion. Earlier in 1952, Howard Sheperd became Chair of <italic>Citi</italic>, James Stillman Rockefeller took the presidency, and George Moore became the EVP for domestic operations. By 1955, <italic>Citi</italic> bought <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>New York</italic>. While James Stillman Rockefeller soon became Chair of <italic>Citi</italic> NB, his cousin David Rockefeller became President of <italic>Chase</italic>. \nDavid\u2019s brother, Nelson, governed New York (1959-73) after Herbert Lehman (1933-42), Lehman\u2019s former appointee Thomas Dewey (1943-54), and Averell Harriman (1955-8). <italic>Harriman</italic>\u2019s Prescott Bush also represented Connecticut in the Senate. Two years after <italic>Lazard</italic> promoted Howard Kniffin to Partner in 1954, his daughter wed <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Robert Huntington, a great second-great-grandson of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Civil War era leader Moses Taylor, grandson of <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic> director, and cousin of the Astors. \nAfter acquiring the former <italic>London, Paris, and American Bank</italic> of San Francisco in 1955, <italic>Crocker</italic> NB became California\u2019s fourth largest, following <italic>TransAmerica</italic> <italic>Bank of America</italic>, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Los Angeles</italic>, and <italic>American Trust </italic>of San Francisco . While FRS forced <italic>TransAmerica</italic> to sell <italic>Bank of America</italic> under AA1914, bank regulators controlled intra-state bank mergers, and so FRS could not force <italic>TransAmerica</italic> to fully divest banks. \nSo,  required regulators to assess bank mergers for soundness and competition, banned multi-bank BHC nonbank activities, and allowed states to regulate inter-state mergers, which most forbade. By 1958, <italic>TransAmerica </italic>spun off <italic>FirstAmerica</italic>, becoming a LIC. Although one-bank BHCs could engage in nonbank activities, there were few. But against their California rival, Lehman-cousin Hellman\u2019s <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> bought <italic>American Trust</italic> in 1960 to become the nation\u2019s 11th largest bank. \nMeanwhile, since Douglas Dillon became Chair of <italic>Dillon</italic> after WWII, he left to serve in the Eisenhower Administration, first as Ambassador to France and then Under Secretary of State, reporting to family friend John Dulles. While Dulles soon resigned, financiers reorganized. As Peter Flanigan worked at <italic>Dillon</italic>, his father Horace was Vice Chair of <italic>Manufacturers Trust</italic> and sister married Thomas Murray McDonnell. \nAfter McDonnell\u2019s sister married the son of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York Catholic Partner George Murnane in 1957 (who made partner the following year), McDonnell\u2019s cousin Dan Lufkin\u2014grandson of <italic>Texaco</italic>\u2019s Chair and grandnephew of <italic>Edison</italic> executive Thomas Murray\u2014co-founded <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette </italic>as a research boutique in 1959. Within a year, Lufkin married into the owners of <italic>WR Grace</italic> HC. In 1959, Charles Stewart left <italic>Lazard</italic> New York to lead <italic>Manufacturers Trust </italic>with Flanigan, the two led a merger with <italic>Hanover Bank</italic> into <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic> in 1961, the fifth largest bank.\nAlso in 1959, <italic>Morgan </italic>NB merged with <italic>Guaranty </italic>NB, and <italic>Chemical </italic>NB acquired <italic>New York Trust</italic> in the same year to become the fourth largest bank. Henry Alexander soon recruited Thomas Gates, son of a <italic>Morgan </italic>partner from the 1920s who left to lead <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic>. Gates was a <italic>Drexel</italic> partner until the 1950s, when he left to serve Eisenhower in senior Navy roles and then Secretary of the Defense. From 1961, Gates led <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Guaranty</italic>. However, <italic>Morgan</italic> lost her kinterlink to <italic>Lehman</italic> as John Fell\u2014whose father descended from Anthony Drexel\u2014died in 1961. Shortly before, a great niece of Anthony Drexel married fellow divorcee Geoffrey Hellman, a <italic>New Yorker</italic> writer, whose a great-grandson of Joseph Seligman, first cousin twice removed of Isaias Hellman, and third cousin of Esther Hellmann Lazard.\n<italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>lost her connection to <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>New York</italic> as <italic>Citi</italic> bought shares in cash rather than equity. While George Baker II continued to be involved in the bank, his Drexel wife divorced him in 1958, and he married a British actress. His son, George Baker III, joined <italic>Citi</italic> after graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1961. Baker II remained connected to <italic>Kuhn</italic> through his brother-in-law John Schiff. In 1961, Nelson Rockefeller\u2019s daughter married William Strawbridge, his second cousin, Robert Strawbridge\u2014a descendant of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>\u2019s George Baker and the Berwinds, who had collaborated with <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> </italic>and aunt married a Harjes of the original <italic>Morgan</italic> Paris partnership\u2014graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1962 and joined <italic>Morgan Guaranty</italic>, he married a granddaughter of <italic>White Weld</italic>\u2019s founder in 1964.\nAs John Kennedy became America\u2019s first Irish Catholic President that year, he promoted Douglas Dillion to UST Secretary. With interests in <italic>Union Oil Co </italic>since the 1920s, <italic>Dillion</italic> faced a scandal for selling tankers, pipelines, and stations to that they controlled, leading <italic>Dillion</italic> President Frederick Brandi to resign from <italic>Union Oil</italic>. Still, <italic>Dillion</italic> Partner Peter Flanigan remained a partner in many oil companies and his father Horace remained a director of <italic>Union Oil Co</italic> even after resigning as head of <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic> in 1961. Despite receiving approval for the merger from the New York Superintendent of Banks and FRS, with input from the FDIC and OCC, <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic> was sued by DOJ under AA1890 and AA1914 in 1961. <italic>Simpson Thacher</italic> <italic>Bartlett</italic> represented the bank, and the court dismissed DOJ\u2019s claims in 1965.\nA cousin-once-removed of prominent <italic>Davis Polk </italic>John Davis, Cyrus Vance was General Counsel of the Department of Defense and became Secretary of the Army in 1961, later serving as Secretary of State under President Carter. His law firm, <italic>S</italic>i<italic>mpson Thacher Bartlett</italic> represented <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Manufacturers Hanover </italic><italic>Trust</italic>. Vance married into the Sloane family; his father-in-law, John Sloane, was a director of <italic>US Trust Co</italic>. In 1964, Stanley Resor, a <italic>Debevoise Plimpton</italic> law partner, succeeded Vance as Deputy Secretary of Defense. Resor\u2019s brother-in-law, Gabriel Hauge, was President of <italic>Manufacturers Hanover Trust</italic>. After Vance\u2019s return to private practice in 1965, Paul Nitze, a former <italic>Dillon</italic> partner and connected to the Rockefeller-linked Pratt family, became Deputy Secretary of Defense.\nBefore the 1961 merger, Gabriel Hauge joined <italic>Manufacturers Trust </italic>in 1958 as Chair of its finance committee, after which <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic>\u2019s board elected Hauge Vice Chair and President by 1963. The son of a Lutheran Reverend from Minnesota, Hauge studied economics at <italic>Harvard </italic>and worked at FRS <italic>New York</italic> before serving as an officer with the Navy in the Pacific during WWII. Gaining a PhD by 1947, Hauge led research at New York\u2019s banking regulator and served as Assistant Chair of the Executive Committee at <italic>McGraw-Hill Publishing</italic> before serving as Research Director for <italic>Citizens for Eisenhower</italic> in 1951. Following the election, Hauge served as Administrative Assistant and then Special Assistant for Economic Affairs until 1958. By the 1960s, Hauge served as treasurer of <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic><italic> </italic>alongside Frank Altschul.\nFrank Altschul did not speak with Andr\u00e9 Meyer after being pushed out of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in the 1940s. Since co-founding the <italic>Council on Foreign Relations</italic> in 1920, Altschul focused his attention there. Providing financial advice to <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Dulles, Altschul served as Treasurer of <italic>National Committee for Free Europe</italic>. Altschul also included <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Brand in the <italic>Council</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> British study groups in the 1950s. As Altschul retired, the <italic>Council</italic> had strong global ties that influenced policy against sanctions on apartheid regimes. \nAlong with <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic>\u2019s Gabriel Hauge, <italic>Council</italic> director and <italic>Sullivan </italic>partner Arthur Dean<italic> </italic>also sat on <italic>AMAX</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> board. Fellow <italic>AMAX</italic> directors, Harold and Walter Hochschild, descendants of Frankfurt-funded <italic>American Can</italic> from the late 19th century, supported the <italic>Council</italic> and the <italic>African American Institute</italic>. <italic>Newmont</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> board featured Andr\u00e9 Meyer, former Secretary of State James Byrnes, and Lewis Douglas, who had personal links to South Africa\u2019s leadership and Chair of <italic>Mutual</italic> LIC <italic>of New York</italic>.\nBecause AA1914 banned directors from interlocking boards of competing companies, a surge of violations led DOJ to initiate extrajudicial enforcement to compel voluntary resignations from the 1950s. Merchant bankers used to hold multiple board seats for large companies, with strong relationships, insider insight, and HC dividends. But as firms diversified bankers, bankers held fewer seats, and their relationship with companies became transactional. Andr\u00e9 Meyer gets credit for innovating retainer fees. As risky credit spurred balance sheet competition, corporate clients paid fees based on the amount of debt and equity capital they raised. With a tiny balance sheet, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York dominated fees for mergers and acquisitions and other complex financial operations. \nSince Ferdinand Eberstadt assisted <italic>United Artists</italic>\u2019 formation in the 1920s during his days with <italic>Dillion</italic>, he joined Meyer at <italic>Lazard</italic> New York to facilitate the sale of Howard Hughes\u2019 RKO film library to <italic>United Artists</italic> in the late 1950s. They maintained close relationships with <italic>United Artists</italic>\u2019 key figures, considering buying out Mary Pickford\u2019s remaining interest in the company before Robert Benjamin and Arthur Krim did so. Eberstadt led <italic>United Artists</italic> initial public offering in 1957, while Meyer handled private financings, often liaising with institutions like <italic>Prudential</italic> Insurance and <italic>STEEL</italic>\u2019s pension fund. \nMeyer also advocated an alliance for <italic>MINERAL</italic> with <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> and his friend, Charles Engelhard, the main precious metal refiner. Andr\u00e9 Meyer knew him via Jane Reis Mannheimer. Since <italic>Mendelssohn </italic>Amsterdam\u2019s Mannheimer died in 1939, his widow Jane immigrated to America with her daughter. While Jane later married Engelhard, her daughter wed a son of <italic>Remington Arms</italic>\u2019 Joseph Reed in 1960. Reed\u2019s other son was married to a daughter of <italic>White</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Weld</italic> Partner Dimitri Yassukovich. From Polish Russia, Yassukovich\u2019s granduncle was a Ukrainian industrialist who organized the turn of the century Franco-Belgian <italic>Prodamet</italic>.\nWhile mutual funds fueled NYSE, exchange funds adopted TA1954 tax-exempt transfers to allow appreciated stocks swaps tax-free for diversified mutual fund shares after 1960. <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York both launched mutual funds in 1958, but the latter did not take on enough risk or invest in sales to grow. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1960</italic>, Zeckendorf sold his properties without aid from <italic>Lazard</italic>, with<italic> Goldman DiLorenzo</italic> buying the <italic>Chrysler Building</italic> from him. \nThe same year, TA1960 granted passthrough taxation for <italic>real estate investment</italic> <italic>trusts</italic> (\u201cREITs\u201d). Investment remained modest for a decade, but among the earliest, an independent lawyer and real estate broker, Harry Helmsley, syndicated the <italic>Empire State Building</italic>. After TA1960, UST\u2019s IRS allowed exchange funds to swap stock for diversified mutual funds tax-free, they soared. Seeking liquidity, <italic>Philipp</italic> partners merged with <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s public <italic>MINERAL</italic> in 1960.\nSince serving as Managing Director of <italic>Baring</italic>, Earl Rowland Baring was appointed Governor of BOE in 1961 and opposed devaluation of the <italic>pound</italic>. However, after France rejected Britain\u2019s application to ECSC in 1963, runs from Britain\u2019s <italic>pound</italic> led FRS to hike rates again. Amidst the crisis, <italic>Warburg</italic> sold the first MMEU bond for an Italian borrower, like they did in the 1920s from Amsterdam. To bypass American regulations, American banks abroad developed offshore <italic>dollar</italic> deposits. \nSince her London operations remained intact through WWII, <italic>White Weld</italic> soon led the market, particularly after her Zurich branch partnered with <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> in 1962. By 1964, <italic>White Weld</italic> raised funds for Finnish <italic>Kesko</italic> without American involvement, but with participation from <italic>Deutsche</italic>. Having joined <italic>Citi</italic> London in 1962, Michael Clemm helped bridge networks as his father was a German baron and maternal grandfather Harry Green led <italic>International Banking Corp</italic> before acquisition by <italic>Citi</italic> and then served as VP. \nWith the rise of MMEU, American banks used the <italic>Edge Act of 1919</italic> to expand overseas by the early 1960s. <italic>Morgan </italic>NB resurrected its old international network and set up offices in Frankfurt, Rome, and Tokyo, with interests in 11 financial houses spanning from Australia to Peru to Morocco by 1962. While <italic>Chase</italic> NB branches catered to Nigerian traders and Panamanian ranchers, <italic>Bank of America</italic> expanded to Guam and Japan, and <italic>Citi</italic> to Malaysia, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, India, Lebanon, and Ecuador. With nationalization risk, banks had different strategies. While <italic>Chase</italic> entered JVs using minority investments, <italic>Citi</italic> generally expanded via wholly owned bank branches or subsidiaries.\nLikewise, <italic>Morgan </italic>engaged internationally. Following the death of his father John Carter and WWII, Bernard became Senior Partner of <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris,<italic> </italic>replacing Nelson Jay as Chair in 1955. While <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> were keen for a new bank, BOE withheld approval due to exchange control regulations. After the 1959 merger of <italic>Morgan </italic>with <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic> and the death of <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris Chair Bernard Carter in 1961, <italic>Morgan </italic>secured permission for a 30% stake in the new <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris in 1962 with minority investment from Dutch <italic>Hope</italic>, <italic>Mees</italic>, and <italic>Lissa Kann</italic>, which partnered together. While the venture clashed in Germany and Switzerland over financial autonomy with <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>\u2019s intervention and collaboration averted a crisis, and <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris thrived independently, managing numerous international MMEU debt issues. \nSince brothers Pierre and Raymond Meynial joined <italic>Morgan Paris</italic> and <italic>Worms</italic> before WWII, Raymond rose to Managing Partner of <italic>Worms</italic> by 1949 and his relative married Octave Homberg\u2019s granddaughter, while Pierre\u2019s became VP and Managing Director of <italic>Morgan Guaranty</italic> Paris in 1958. Following the Jay and Carter era, Pierre Meynial became President of <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris in 1963 and served as a director for IBM <italic>Europe</italic>, <italic>Minnesota de France</italic>, and <italic>Co Industrielle Maritime</italic>, while also being Honorary President <italic>of International Harvester France</italic>. By 1967, Pierre\u2019s brother Raymond became Chair and CEO of <italic>Worms</italic>. Likewise, French-born lawyer Jean Villechaise, the son-in-law of <italic>Drexel</italic> Senior Partner Edward Hopkinson, served as CEO of <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris from 1965, later replacing Meynial as Chair.\nSimilarly, American accountancies crossed the Atlantic. Following SA1933, accountancies expanded rapidly to meet the demand for certified public accounting services, as the act required publicly held corporations to include financial statements in registration documents and issue audited reports. By 1935, <italic>Seidman</italic> had opened offices in Bradford, Pennsylvania; Worcester, Massachusetts; Washington, DC; Memphis, Tennessee; Fitchburg, Massachusetts; and High Point, North Carolina. In 1963, <italic>Seidman</italic> formed <italic>Binder Seidman International</italic> with <italic>Binder Dijker</italic> <italic>Otte</italic> and other firms from Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, and Canada, later rebranding as BDO <italic>Seidman</italic>.\n<italic>Seidman</italic> had competition. Of unknown relation to the family of <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic>, fellow Quaker Henry Cooper Benson began articles at <italic>Cooper</italic> in London in 1926, aided by his uncle Francis Cooper, Chair of <italic>Lever</italic>. He qualified as a chartered accountant in 1932 and became a partner in 1934. Returning to <italic>Cooper</italic><italic> </italic>after WWII, he co-founded the management consultancy arm, and led its international expansion through the creation of <italic>Cooper</italic> <italic>Lybrand</italic> in 1957. While fellow <italic>Cooper</italic> Senior Partner Sidney Pears served as a director of <italic>British Bank of the Middle East</italic>, Benson\u2019s son joined <italic>Lazard</italic> London by 1967.\nEven Canada, where private cartels helped avoid the much of the 1930s, expropriated private PUs from <italic>Canada</italic> <italic>Power </italic>PUIHC and others in 1963. After Indonesia nationalized her main branch in 1962, <italic>Dutch East Indies Co </italic>successor <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> sold <italic>Chase</italic> NB her South-East Asian banks. As <italic>Hope</italic>, <italic>Mees</italic>, and <italic>Lissa Kann</italic> partnered together, <italic>Amsterdam Bank</italic> and <italic>Rotterdam Bank </italic>merged within a year into <italic>Amsterdam-Rotterdam </italic>(\u201cAMRO\u201d), <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> merged with <italic>Twentsche Bank</italic> to form <italic>Algemene Bank Nederland</italic> (\u201cABN\u201d) in 1964. \nBut as banks merged, Dutch central bank, <italic>De Nederlandsche Bank</italic>, had limited supervisory powers. Although the Court Jew bank of <italic>Teixeira </italic>was led by Protestant Jan Fehmers, <italic>De Nederlandsche Bank</italic> issued many credit warnings that went unenforced. In 1963, <italic>Mendes Gans\u2014</italic>founded by Teixeira and Cah\u00e9n cousins in Amsterdam before being aryanizied as <italic>Dutch Banking House</italic> since 1940\u2014reclaimed her former name when American <italic>Dow Chemical</italic> bought the Dutch bank to support her medium-sized customers seeking medium-term MMEU loans.\nHaving reorganized PUs since the 1940s, Bidwell became NYSE\u2019s first honorary Chair in 1961. Within months, a federal jury indictment for tax evasion forced him to resign before he was cleared in 1963. After DOJ sued GE and <italic>Westinghouse</italic> under AA1914, courts sent executives to prison and awarded TVA damages. Since steel firms raised prices without wages in 1962, Kennedy shamed them into retreat. \nUST Secretary Dillon soon pushed through pro-business solutions, empowering Kennedy to cut tariffs and pushing through leasing legislation, with some input from <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Weinberg. As long-term contracts stabilized prices as Congress allowed SBA to guarantee limited leases, TA1962 accelerated TA1954\u2019s lease depreciation and introduced investment tax credits. Likewise, New York allowed LICs to buy leases, UST allowed banks to lease, and FPC extended PU contracts. As lease shelters magnified early profits, lease yields fell below bank rates. By 1962, America\u2019s EXIM created the <italic>Foreign Credit Insurance Association</italic> of 50 insurers to promote American capital equipment export. \nSince 1950, <italic>Lazard</italic> London arranged <italic>supplier</italic> credits with ECGD guarantees. Along with her dominance in export finance, most of Britain\u2019s big contractors were her clients. Kindersley, Brand, and their partners also held multiple directorates on these, with two <italic>English Electric</italic> seats. As Britain financed capital exports, <italic>Lazard</italic> London led a consortium of 28 British insurers in April 1961. After extending credit for the purchase of the <italic>British Ford Motor</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London dominated long-term loans to purchasers of British capital equipment through the 1960s. \nIn 1962, <italic>Lazard</italic> London all but invented <italic>buyer</italic> credits to finance imports after her first international project failed. While <italic>Lazard</italic> led 39 British banks, insurers, and pensions to fund <italic>English Electric</italic> and <italic>Siemens</italic> hydro-electric PU in Peru with a German bank, Peru switched to an Italian group after site preparation. Also that year, Britain and Italy ended Europe\u2019s stock rally by taxing capital gains and dividends. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris developed real estate through banks. Since Clotilde Lazard married Edmond Alphand\u00e9ry around 1900\u2014of a family of 19th century State Jews from Bordeaux and Marseille closely related to fellow lawyer Cr\u00e9mieux\u2014Sophie Weill married Treasurer-Paymaster General Pierre Alphand\u00e9ry, and their son, Claude, joined the Ministry of Finance, where he headed the Economic Budgets Office after WWII. \nAs <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris co-founded involved <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Fran\u00e7aise de Construction</italic>, COGEFIMO, <italic>Union Immobili\u00e8re et Financi\u00e8re</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Immobili\u00e8re</italic> and other real estate ventures through her pre-WWII <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier Industriel</italic> (\u201cSOVAC\u201d) between 1958 and 1962, Alphand\u00e9ry became a Managing Director of <italic>Immobili\u00e8re-Constructions de Paris </italic>in 1962, controlled by his Lazard cousins. Promoted to Chair and CEO in 1972, he also became a Director of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme de Gestion Immobili\u00e8re</italic>. Over this time, he also served as Chair and CEO of <italic>Banque de la Construction et des Travaux</italic> <italic>Publics</italic>. \nIn Britain, peace time female labor participation reached the levels of 1861 for the first time. Between 1958 and 1960, <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Dean served as Eisenhower\u2019s chief of delegation on maritime boundaries against excessive increases by the Soviet bloc. In 1956, only 18 women worked at large New York law firms. As Barbara Lindemann graduated from <italic>Yale </italic>Law that year, <italic>Davis Polk</italic> and <italic>Cravath</italic> told her they were not hiring women. While <italic>Sullivan</italic><italic> </italic>hired her, the firm limited the prospect of a female partner by hiring, at most, one a year. Still, <italic>Sullivan</italic><italic> </italic>opened doors and Lindemann left after three years to join the Kennedy Administration. \n<italic>Cravath</italic> continued to hire connected and talented Jews. Since <italic>Petschek</italic> heir fled Czechoslovakia during WWII, Stephen Petschek graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law School, joining at <italic>Cravath </italic>in 1956 but left for <italic>Loeb</italic> in 1963, where he rose to partner.  In 1961, however, <italic>Davis Polk</italic> did name her first Jewish partner, James King, a decade before a female partner. Unlike <italic>Sullivan</italic> and <italic>Cravath</italic>, <italic>Davis Polk</italic> began permitting detours for government service, intra-office marriages, permanent places for those passed over for partnership. \nUnder President Kennedy, John McCloy resigned as Chair of <italic>Chase</italic> NB and joined<italic> Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Dean to negotiate a nuclear test ban and disarmament from 1961. However, the Cold War almost turned hot until the Soviet Union decided against keeping nuclear missiles in Cuba in October 1962. By August 1963, Dean joined Under Secretary for Political Affairs for Harriman to sign a treaty with Moscow. While Kennedy advocated for reform of immigration quotas from that year, he was assassinated. As VP Lyndon Johnson of Texas became President, he accepted advice from Meyer, Rockefeller, Osborne, and Weinberg. (Weinberg\u2019s referrals became secretaries of Commerce and UST.) Likewise, <italic>Lehman</italic> hired the former commander of American forces in Europe during WWII and leader of the Berlin airlift, General Lucius Clay, as one of four senior partners.\nEarlier, Kennedy also had consulted <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Weinberg on organizing the <italic>Communications Satellite Corp</italic> and airline executive Stanley Osborne on creating an American competitor to the British-French <italic>Concorde</italic> supersonic. He also continued relying on Andr\u00e9 Meyer as his banker. In the 1950s, French mismanagement led to the undervaluation of the <italic>Franco Wyoming Oil </italic>despite owning oil and gas fields and ranches in western America. As <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Michel Weill convinced Meyer and other partners, Meyer sought help from London and Paris to pay $55 for <italic>Franco Wyoming Oil </italic>shares, $6.5 more than the posted price. Despite <italic>Franco Wyoming Oil</italic>\u2019s counterproposals, press campaigns, and legal actions, the successful hostile takeover resulted in Osborne as CEO, establishing <italic>Lazard</italic> New York as a takeover specialist. \nWhile oil tanker magnate Daniel Ludwig bought 15% of <italic>Dillon</italic> in 1963, Stewart retired from <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic>, joining <italic>Lazard</italic>-controlled <italic>Franco Wyoming Oil</italic> as a director in 1964. By 1964, Paul Miller, son-in-law of <italic>Guarant</italic>y NB\u2019s Vice Chair\u2014became President of <italic>First Boston</italic>. After selling a minority interest to a British firm in 1960, <italic>Harriman Ripley </italic>merged with <italic>Drexel</italic> in 1965, bringing New York and Philadelphia interests into alignment. Shortly after, <italic>Dillon</italic> banker Philip Dillon Allen, a grandson of Clarence Dillon, married a daughter of <italic>Gulf Oil</italic> executive Philip Fell, a great-grandson of Anthony Drexel.\nLikewise, California interests aligned as <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> promoted McDonnell\u2019s brother-in-law Richard Cooley from branch manager to EVP in 1965, and President soon after, one of the youngest in the country. Although McDonnell\u2019s sister divorced Henry Ford II in 1964, their daughter Anne married Giancarlo Uzielli\u2014a Catholic descendant of the Pereire, Deutsch-Meurthe, and Sassoon families, with Rothschild and Gunzburg cousins\u2014and thrice divorced Greek oil tanker magnate Niarchos.\nBankers also advised <italic>BANK</italic>\u2019s <italic>International Finance Corp</italic> (\u201cIFC\u201d). By 1963, the <italic>Bankers Advisory Committee</italic> included Hermann Abs of <italic>Deutsche </italic>in Frankfurt, William Burns Harcourt of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> in London; Raffaele Mattioli of <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic> in Milan; Andr\u00e9 Meyer of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York; and Guy Rothschild of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris. <italic>BANK</italic>\u2019s IBRD\u2019s <italic>Economic Development</italic> <italic>Institute</italic> benefited from guidance provided by a <italic>Universities Advisory Committee</italic>, including Simon Kuznets and Edward Mason from <italic>Harvard</italic>, Max Millikan from MIT, Theodore Schultz from <italic>Uni of Chicago</italic>, Robert Triffin from <italic>Yale</italic>, and CA Curtis from <italic>Queens Uni</italic>.\nWhile <italic>Chase</italic> entered JVs using minority investments, <italic>Citi</italic> generally expanded via wholly owned bank branches or subsidiaries. There were also multi-national corporations. In 1964, New York Senator Jacob Javits invited George Moore, <italic>Citi</italic> President and in-law of Mexican elite, to collaborate on the \u2018<italic>Atlantic Community Development Group for Latin America</italic>\u2019 (\u201c<italic>ADELA</italic>\u201d). With legal advice from <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Allen Dulles, they started a syndicate to promote economic development and investment in Latin America. \nDespite refusal of <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>ADELA</italic> secured investments from Italy\u2019s <italic>Fiat</italic>, Belgium\u2019s <italic>Petrofina</italic>, Switzerland\u2019s <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>, a Japanese consortium, IBM and OIL. <italic>ADELA</italic> or invested approximately $200 million. Over a decade, <italic>ADELA</italic> mobilized a total investment of $2 billion, with more than half of the funding coming from local sources, and some small part from <italic>BANK</italic>\u2019s IFC, <italic>Inter-American Development Bank</italic>, and EXIM. One of <italic>ADELA</italic>\u2019s standout projects was the Brazilian mass-market shoemaker <italic>Alpargatas</italic>.\nWhile Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s fourth great-grandson Leo married a Katz-descendant Henriques Waley, his sister married a <italic>Montagu</italic> heir. After Leo joined <italic>Montagu</italic> in 1961, <italic>Montagu</italic> continued to grow. By 1963, <italic>Citi</italic> acquired a stake in <italic>Samuel</italic> to alongside Charles Clore enter Britain. \nThat year, <italic>Samuel</italic> and <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston </italic>joined <italic>Frankfurter Bank</italic> to expand Swiss <italic>International Factors</italic> expanded into Germany.  As <italic>Samuel </italic>merged with <italic>Hill Higginson</italic> <italic>Erlanger</italic>\u2014which fused in 1959 and bought a minority interest in <italic>Harriman Ripley\u2014</italic>into <italic>Hill Samuel</italic>, one of London\u2019s largest merchant banks in 1965, <italic>Citi</italic> and Clore supported the <italic>Samuel</italic> family shareholders over or control over the Hills. Although Leo Erlanger had stepped down as Vice Chair of <italic>Hill Higginson</italic> <italic>Erlanger</italic> in 1961, his aristocratic cousin\u2019s niece married PM Winston Churchill\u2019s grandson in 1964.\nLikewise, while the 19th century Jewish founded London stockbrokerages of <italic>Rosselli</italic><italic> </italic> and <italic>Jacobs</italic>\u2014the former founded by <italic>Lyonnais</italic> London\u2019s Manager of a Davidic Sephardi family and the latter by a Rothschild affiliate\u2014merged in 1961, they were taken over by older, Christian <italic>Capel</italic> by 1964. \nIn October 1964, Labour regained Britain\u2019s Parliament for the first time since 1951 under PM Wilson. As  capital and current trade deficits threatened the <italic>pound</italic>, Wilson sought devaluation, leading him to clash with BOE Governor Rowland Baring. Instead, Baring reached out to bankers in ten countries and secured $3 billion in credits to support the <italic>pound</italic>. \nAmongst other measures to conserve gold, Parliament\u2019s 1965 budget taxed Clore-type real estate lease arbitrage. By 1966, <italic>Parliament</italic> established a publicly underwritten mortgage market. To strengthen gold dealers and stimulate energy and mining investment, BOE allowed <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>\u2019s <italic>Johnson</italic> to open a bank subsidiary, JMB, in 1965. And as <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic> began drilling for oil 1965, BOE asked<italic> Kleinwort Benson</italic> to buy <italic>Sharp Pixley </italic>in 1966. \n<italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> also grew closer to <italic>Baring</italic> and BOE. In 1967, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Chair William Burns Harcourt appointed John Stevens as Chief Executive. A member of the <italic>Special Operations Executive</italic> during WWII, Stevens had been Executive Director of BOE since 1957, after serving as Director of the European Department at IMF. In 1940, he married a daughter of <italic>Westminster Bank</italic> director Chris Hely-Hutchinson. \nIn 1968, Stevens recruited his wife\u2019s cousin, Bill Mackworth-Young\u2014a descendant of Francis Baring\u2019s brother and first cousin once removed of Edward Young, Chair of <italic>Imperial Bank of Persia</italic>, which was renamed to <italic>British Bank of the Middle East</italic> in 1949\u2014who had worked at <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic>. Stevens also brought in Chris Reeves, who had joined BOE in 1958 and moved to <italic>Hill Samuel</italic> in 1963.\nSince entering America in 1960 with <italic>Paribas by Lehman</italic> in New York, <italic>Paribas</italic> collaborated with <italic>Warburg</italic> London to expanded in London in 1964 and with Harry Oppenheimer\u2019s <italic>DeBeers</italic> the same year. Oppenheimer joined <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Board in 1967. Likewise, <italic>Warburg</italic> London recruited David Scholey to establish <italic>Warburg</italic> New York in 1965. While his father was a partner at <italic>Guinness Mahon</italic> since 1923, his uncle brokered insurance at <italic>Lloyd</italic>. After <italic>Oxford</italic>, Scholey worked at <italic>Lloyd</italic> and joined <italic>Guinness Mahon</italic> in 1958. He later worked in Canada and married the daughter of George Drew, former leader of the Canadian Conservative Party.\nAfter allying with <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic>, <italic>Warburg</italic> London launched <italic>Transatlantic Bond Fund</italic> with <italic>Bank of London </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> South America</italic>, <italic>Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</italic>, and <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>, soon expanding to include AMRO, <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>. The same year, <italic>Seligman</italic> Paris merged with <italic>Louis-Hirsch</italic>, with Bronfman-in-law Alain Gunzburg becoming briefly leading <italic>Seligman</italic> <italic>Louis</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Hirsch</italic> until joining <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic><italic> </italic>bank, where he held interests. \nForming an Australian merchant bank with <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1964, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> invested in HSBC-affiliated Middle Eastern banks and in <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s old India affiliate, <italic>Yule Catto</italic>. As head of <italic>Chase International Ventures</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Meyer formed more development banks, including Greece in 1963\u2014with <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, <italic>BANK</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Lambert</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic>, and <italic>Mediobanca</italic>\u2014and French Client Ivory Coast in 1965, where Meyer was close with F\u00e9lix Houphouet-Boigny. <italic>Chase</italic> also invested in British East Asia-focused <italic>Chartered Bank</italic>. When Walter Wriston replaced George Moore as President of<italic> Citi</italic> in 1967, Andr\u00e9 Meyer failed to recruit Moore for <italic>Lazard</italic> New York.\nBy the end of the decade, <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s David Rockefeller created an international advisory committee including Agnelli in Italy and Tata in India. However, when he sought to create an international investment bank with <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Union Bank of Switzerland</italic>, <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>, <italic>Lambert</italic>, and the two <italic>Rothschild</italic> banks in 1966, the first two flatly refused. As <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>\u2019s Wallenberg backed out under pressure from <italic>Morgan</italic>, the last three followed. \nA prominent Philipson of the time, G\u00f6ran, grandson of industrialist Carl, was a metallurgy and plastics executive and, for a decade from 1962, held board seats in Sweden\u2019s general export association, industrial association, and <italic>Board of Governors for Economic Defense</italic>.\nWallenberg\u2019s industrial holdings saw significant growth as a share of Swedish labor, going from 4% in 1924 to 11% in 1945 and 23% by 1969. Continuing to marry Swedish aristocracy, the family directorates included telephony giant <italic>Erickson</italic> and <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic>.<italic> </italic>By 1972, <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> merged with <italic>Skandinaviska Kredit</italic>, Sweden\u2019s second-largest commercial bank, into <italic>Skandinaviska Enskilda </italic>under Marcus Wallenberg and his son, Marcus Jr, to compete with global giants.\nWhen UST bond yields surpassed MMFR, small banks profited by borrowing from squeezed large banks. To stabilize banks and quell the outflow of gold, FRS raised <italic>Reg Q</italic> ceilings and deregulated MMFR with UST. After <italic>Morgan </italic>broke the stigma for cheap credit, banks pushed MMFR rates over FRS\u2019 discount and bought tax-exempt municipal bonds. To promote domestic production in 1964, Congress privatized nuclear energy and AEC banned PUs from using foreign uranium. As <italic>Westinghouse</italic>, <italic>Gulf Oil</italic>, and PUs cartelized American uranium mines to bundle technology and fuel, they dominated global nuclear PU sales.\nSince 1959, Japan reentered the international finance markets after 28 years, raising $30 million in New York from a syndicate led by <italic>First Boston</italic> for a hydroelectric project. As booming American markets attracted foreign issuers, decreasing America\u2019s balance of payments, thus inflating the <italic>dollar</italic>. As TA1964 taxed overseas borrowing to discourage heavy capital to the difference between American and world interest rates in order outflows that were putting pressure on the dollar at the time and cut income and corporate taxes (leaving capital gains unchanged), investors ran from stocks to MMEU.<italic> </italic>While <italic>Goldman</italic> and others turned to foreign branches to help clients, <italic>Sullivan</italic><italic> </italic>did not and suffered a sharp business curtailment.\nWhile <italic>Vneshtorg</italic> handled transactions with capitalist countries, the Soviet Union established the <italic>International Bank for Economic Cooperation</italic> (\u201cIBWZ\u201d) in Moscow in 1963 to facilitate settlement and finance trade among state-owned banks in East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Mongolia. IBWZ processed settlements, granting credits, and accepted gold and convertible currencies deposits. Amidst postwar nationalization, Poland\u2019s <italic>Handlowy</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> remained an exception until the government took full control. <italic>Handlowy</italic>\u2019s pivotal role in foreign trade allowed it to survive, gaining a monopoly in 1964, yet limiting its domestic financial services despite an expanding international presence. \nBut as Japan\u2019s balance of payments worsened, BOJ raised reserve requirements in late 1963. By January, Japan\u2019s large banks and securities firms formed a securities price-support institution, which BOJ supported. By May, TA1964 forced Japan to float a $100 million bond in London, compared with the $60 million raised there the previous year by public and private borrowers. As <italic>pound</italic> forward discounts narrowed, investors moved money from New York to London. FRS increased the discount by buying spot <italic>pounds</italic> and selling forwards, but the <italic>pound</italic> suffered as FRS sold the maturing contracts. So, America, Europe, Japan, and BIS braced the <italic>pound</italic> with a $3 billion fund at yearend. \nSince <italic>Safra</italic> and others fled Syria, Brazil\u2019s central bank doubled her gold reserves to 90%. As Marxist entered government in 1963, inflation and economic instability led to a military coup. By 1964, Brazil stabilized finances by linking electricity rates to oil prices and privatizing key industries, such as the sale of iron mines <italic>COALH</italic>. During this period, the government also invested heavily in infrastructure projects and industrialization, leading to increased foreign investment and trade. \nAmerican race reforms and Indian caste reforms primarily interacted through the exchange of ideas and strategies. Indian concepts, particularly Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s philosophy of nonviolent civil disobedience, greatly influenced the American Civil Rights Movement, with leaders like Reverend Martin King Jr, the son of an influential Baptist minister, deriving inspiration from Gandhi\u2019s strategies and principles. Additionally, Indian and American activists exchanged ideas and strategies, contributing to a global dialogue on civil rights and social justice.\nIncorporating America\u2019s 14th Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause into India\u2019s Article 14 endorsed affirmative action, both employing the rational basis test to assess the constitutionality of legislation. Unlike America, India did not adopt strict scrutiny standards, focusing on combatting social discrimination rather than state-sponsored discrimination. Initially, the Hindu Arya Samaj movement influenced Untouchable Dalit shoemakers of Agra pursued Sanskritization and Kshatriya status claims. \nAs India\u2019s Independence movement gained momentum in the 1930s, the heir of Dalits made wealthy by generations of military service to EIC, BR Ambedkar, received economics doctorates from <italic>Columbia</italic> and <italic>London School of Economics</italic>, and drew inspiration from American ideals of equality and affirmative action. Converting to Buddhism to identify as a \u2018Scheduled\u2019 caste, he co-founded the Republican Party of Agra in 1958, as a platform for \u2018new Buddhists\u2019 striving for Dalit political power instead of supporting the caste system with Sanskritization.\nIn America, civil rights leaders in Memphis actively pursued desegregation. Lucius Burch Jr, a White attorney, and Jesse Turner, an accountant who had joined the Black-owned <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> in 1949, established a social club in 1961 for young professionals to foster interracial understanding. Marvin Ratner, a Jewish partner at the prestigious <italic>Heiskell</italic> law firm, and Russell Sugarmon, a prominent Black attorney, joined in 1963. Transcending racial barriers, their friendship blossomed through frequent visits and political collaboration.\nLikewise, in Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1964, Jewish Adam Stein and Black Julius Chambers established the state\u2019s first integrated law firm. Earlier, Chambers had studied at <italic>North Carolina College for Negroes</italic> under Moritz Manasse, a Greek philosophy expert expelled by Nazi Germany in the 1930s and was discriminated by elite White universities due to antisemitism and anti-immigrant sentiments. \nChambers and Stein collaborated with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund to shape federal civil rights law more than any other law firm. And Abraham Heschel advocated for social justice and peace, marching alongside Martin King Jr in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, and actively protesting the Vietnam War. Born to a Hasidic family and a Katz descendant in Warsaw, Heschel earned his PhD in philosophy from <italic>Uni of Berlin</italic> in 1933. Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1938, he arrived in the America by 1940, where he taught and published.\nBy 1963, Soviet ideals spread to America through Africa. Malcolm X closely observed the spread of Marxism and decolonization, and he called on African Americans not to align themselves solely with White liberals. As Black grassroots organizers planned a radical protest in DC, the Kennedy Administration sought to moderate it. Working with <italic>Taconic Foundation</italic>\u2014led by Andrew Mellon\u2019s granddaughter, her Warburg-related Prue husband, and their attorney founder of <italic>Paul Weiss</italic>\u2014directed funds to NAACP, Urban League, and  other civil rights groups willing to coordinate with federal officials, leading Malcolm X to accuse them of emasculation.\nInstead, he urged them to identify with other oppressed people. Malcolm believed in elevating the struggle for Black freedom to an international level, aligning with movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America against \u2018American neocolonialism.\u2019 In addition to advocating for a rejection of capitalism, Malcolm X converted to Islam and drew attention to the plight of \u201cPalestinians\u201d starting in the late 1950s. He visited Gaza refugee camps months before his assassination in 1965.\nDespite the Court\u2019s 1954 decision for equal protection, Southern Black economic opportunities did not grow until the <italic>Civil Rights Act of 1964</italic> formed <italic>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</italic> (\u201cEEOC\u201d) to enforce civil rights law for women and racial minorities, including desegregation and raise living standards. Outlawing voting discrimination the following year, Johnson appointed <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Dean to co-Chair compliance oversight and FDR\u2019s son as the first Chair. Through affirmative action, EEOC upgraded WEB DuBois\u2019 vision of fostering a Black elite, the \u2018talented tenth,\u2019 from private interests of the <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic> to a federally funded national scale. \nAlso in 1964, President Johnson appointed the first woman to lead FTC. Since 1953, <italic>Jones Beach</italic>-heiress Mary Gardiner Jones was a trial lawyer in DOJ\u2019s antitrust division. At FTC, Jones expanded the FTC\u2019s purview to ensure the safety, affordability, and truthfulness of advertising. She was a vocal opponent of cigarette advertising, which was banned in 1970. Likewise, she helped break up alleged cereal and garment monopolies. In 1966, Johnson named Andrew Brimmer the first Black Governor of FRS\u2019 Board. \nBorn in Louisiana, Brimmer earned a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree in economics from <italic>Uni of Washington</italic> by 1951. He received a PhD in economics from <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1957. He worked as an economist at FRS <italic>New York</italic> from 1955 to 1958 and advised the Sudanese government on establishing a central bank in 1956-7. Brimmer joined <italic>Wharton</italic> in 1961 and became Deputy Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs at Department<italic> </italic>of Commerce in 1963.\nIn 1965, big New York law firms employed three Black associates, two of whom were women without client contact. By the time <italic>McKinsey</italic> hired her first Black associate in 1968 her earliest female associates hired in 1963 and 1964 published a book and headed an insurance engagement. \nLikewise, the <italic>Voting Rights Act of 1965</italic> expanded Black political power. But with low Black migration reversal to the South, Northern cities needed low-income housing. While \u2018slum\u2019 clearance per the <italic>Housing Act of 1949</italic> relocated minorities through the 1960s, and\u2014as inflation grew\u2014urban tax collection fell as Whites cartelized low-tax suburbia using federal loans, where redlining segregated by race. Through various waves, New York City\u2019s Jewish population expanded to a third of the population from the 1930s to the 1960s joining other \u2018White\u2019 flight to the suburbs, and accelerating after the 1970s. High taxes, crime, and other urban blights similarly drove affluent Blacks to suburbs with quality education and housing near cities, including majority-black areas like Atlanta and Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, outside of DC.\nThe same year, President Johnson removed the national origins quotas of the 1920s with the <italic>Immigration Act of 1965</italic>. While the restrictive <italic>Immigration Act of 1924 </italic>reduced immigration and inequality, creating opportunities for Black Americans during the Great Migration to take industrial jobs, the influx of foreign-born workers contributed to rising inequality once again. As this legislation interacted with global laws\u2014such as Indian PM Indira Nehru\u2019s nationalization of banks to expand rural credit in 1969\u2014\u2019bookish\u2019 Hindu Brahmins and other elites suppressed by local socialism, affirmative action, and Islamic nationalism shifted marriage criteria from land lording to education, employment, and investment in America, Switzerland, and other countries by the 1970s. Along with policy, technology destabilized Indian serfdom. \nWhile around a third of Dalits were serfs bonded to the land in 1970, the ratio fell as tractor rentals by upper castes replaced human and cattle labor. Despite decades of affirmative action, the American Black Panthers inspired the Dalit Panther, opposing oppression and assimilation through confrontation from the 1970s. Aside from race, the Panthers aligned with Marxists. \nAlong with Johnson\u2019s domestic welfare programs, expenditures for the <italic>Vietnam War</italic> grew UST deficits and inflated the <italic>dollar</italic>. With gold flowing out, Congress eliminated FRS member banks\u2019 gold reserve ratio against FRS deposits, which exacerbated devaluation concerns. As WWI-era UST bond interest rate caps limited UST borrowing, Congress eased them in 1965. To protect the <italic>dollar</italic> in 1965, Congress extended TA1964 long-term foreign securities taxes to all long-term foreign bank loans. Likewise, the <italic>Commerce</italic> <italic>Department </italic>started voluntary commercial capital controls, which increasing MMEU demand. Moreover, FRS traded UST debt in \u2018Operation Twist\u2019 to increase short-term rates and decrease long-term interest rates. \nAs MMEU bonds issues surged, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, lacking a European office, sought to engage in this business. Despite negotiations about potential share acquisitions in <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris<italic> </italic>through early 1966, nothing materialized. But as American authorities imposed restrictions on <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris, citing the <italic>Trust Indenture Act of 1939</italic>, negotiations resulted in <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> acquiring control. To head off inflation, FRS restricted the discount window and raised <italic>Reg Q</italic> ceilings. As credit tightened, New York sought to tax NYSE\u2014like Britain in 1962\u2014but failed as corporations feared chaos. Amidst the crisis, BOJ rescued a large Japanese securities firm. <italic>Narodny</italic> London helped ease the crisis by selling large amounts of gold. \nSince TA1960, exchange funds\u2014which offered investors diversification and tax deferral\u2014were worth over three times the total raised by REITs. However, UST and Congress revoked IRS\u2019 1960 exemption for exchange funds in 1966. As FRS limited discounting, businesses sought credit. So, banks hiked CD rates to fund them, but depositors ran from S&Ls and disrupted housing. \nSince MMFR credit rationing did not work, FRS used <italic>Reg Q</italic> to make it more difficult for banks to sell CDs and CP by capping rates below the market and raising required reserves. While FRS segregated rates by CD maturities, they requested Congressional approval to segregate by size. As brokers financed themselves with CD repos, they lost liquidity and stopped bond market making. Banks, however, fire sold municipal bonds as corporate demand grew. New York\u2019s Governor Rockefeller threatened his brother\u2019s <italic>Chase</italic> would cut off financing unless Moses released TBTA to subsidize MTA.\nWhile FRS opened the discount window to banks that decreased loans instead of selling bonds to fend off the crisis, Congress amended BA1938 to decrease the priority of Federal taxes three years after they were due. Amidst a bankruptcy record and large bank failures, FA1966 empowered FRS to segregate <italic>Reg Q</italic> ceilings and shutter banks for cause. So, FRS directed depositors to S&Ls and CDs over $100 K with higher ceilings than for time deposits and CDs under $100 K. \nAs FRS adopted FA1933\u2019s<italic> Reg Q</italic> as a policy tool, banks opened CD-issuing foreign branches to tap MMEU and converted into one-bank BHCs to issue CP without reserve requirements. Dividing <italic>Reg Q</italic>, FRS capped short-term and retail CDs but hiked long-term, large CDs rates for broker liquidity. Since only large companies could issue long-term debt after the <italic>Panic of 1966</italic>, companies incorporated to issue OTC stock for buyouts. Like with pre-1966 exchange funds, stockholders traded in appreciated, illiquid shares for long-term conglomerate stakes to defer gains taxes.\nSince the Dutch <italic>Hope</italic>, <italic>Mees</italic>, and <italic>Lissa Kann</italic> partnership of 1962 and the ABN and AMRO mergers of 1964 restructured Dutch finance, <italic>Teixeira </italic>experienced liquidity problems in May during the <italic>Panic of 1966</italic>. As <italic>De Nederlandsche Bank</italic> refused Director Jan Fehmers\u2019 calls for aid following years of warnings, <italic>Teixeira </italic>suspended, squeezing depositors. However, the incident garnered newspaper attention, Fehmers was imprisoned, and parliament debated the role of <italic>De Nederlandsche Bank</italic> until reforming supervision in 1978. While ABN acquired the South America-focused <italic>Hollandsche Bank </italic>in 1967, Fehmers\u2019 cousin, Onno Ruding, earned a PhD, and became a director of AMRO.<italic> </italic>ABN acquired <italic>Hope</italic> <italic>Mees </italic><italic>Lissa Kann </italic>of Amsterdam and the Hague, <italic>LaSalle Bank</italic> of Chicago, and <italic>Neuflize</italic> <italic>Schlumberger</italic> <italic>Mallet </italic>of Paris in 1977.\nPer Swiss invitation to compete with Britain, <italic>Narodny</italic> Zurich opened in 1966, allowing the Soviets to buy gold from Switzerland instead of through <italic>Samuel</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Montagu</italic> in London. Having also established a Tehran branch, <italic>Narodny</italic> sought to open a Tokyo branch. Having ended preferential rates for export credits in 1956, Germany hiked rates as monetary policy amidst 1966\u2019s inflation, like other regimes. \nWith few ECGD guarantees\u2014unlike Britain and France\u2014German banks risked interest rates in rolling-over short-term MMEU loans. Karl Blessing, President of <italic>German Bundesbank</italic> (\u201cGBB\u201d) since Germany regained monetary policy powers after the Allies dissolved GRB in 1945, had been dismissed by the Nazis during WWII for his refusal to infiltrate <italic>Unilever</italic>\u2019s international operations. Continuing his anti-cyclical policies that put him at odds with Bonn politicians, Blessing protected the <italic>mark</italic> even as Chancellor Ludwig Erhard\u2019s government fell.\nAs <italic>Krupp</italic> sought an export credit from a bank consortium-led trade facility for the delivery of industrial plants to Marxist Europe, the <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>-led credit committee refused to grant <italic>Krupp</italic> the loan on full liability. So, the German federal government stepped in and provided guarantees for the loan, allowing <italic>Krupp</italic> to proceed with the deal. As a condition of the guarantee, <italic>Krupp</italic> incorporated, ending five generations of family rule. By 1967, Germany abolished bank retail interest rate cartel to spur credit competition. The same year, Abs turned 65 and so retired per <italic>Deutsche</italic> policy.\nSo, the <italic>Panic of 1966</italic> spurred cross-border bank alliances. Since <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, Dutch <italic>Pierson</italic>, and Belgian <italic>Lambert</italic> formed New York-based <italic>Amsterdam Overseas</italic>\u2014Gustav Fleck and John Birkelund\u2014in 1956, they spun off the investment arm (soon acquired by <italic>Aetna</italic> LIC) in 1967 and formed <italic>New Court Securities</italic>, which invested in <italic>Bank of</italic> <italic>California</italic> NB soon after. By 1968, four major banks\u2014British <italic>Midland Bank</italic>, German <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, Belgian SG <italic>Belge</italic>, and Dutch AMRO\u2014established <italic>European-American Bank & Trust</italic> in New York City to facilitate transatlantic investments.\nWhile <italic>Berenberg Gossler </italic>of Hamburg gained investment from <italic>Philadelphia</italic> NB and <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> in 1967, 19th century private banks <italic>Hengst</italic> of Frankfurt and <italic>Schr\u00f6der </italic>and <italic>Munchmeyer</italic> of Hamburg merged in 1969 Back in 1967, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne added a securities division and acquired <italic>Kirchholtes</italic>\u2014the aryanized <italic>Sulzbach</italic> Frankfurt\u2014into a branch. Offices followed in D\u00fcsseldorf (1971) and Munich (1977). \nIn the late 1960s, <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, <italic>Brinckmann Wirtz</italic>\u2014affiliated with the aryanization of <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg\u2014, and <italic>Trinkaus</italic>\u2014led by Johannes Zahn, who had led the Nazi sequestered <italic>Lambert</italic>\u2014created <italic>Allgemeiner Anlagedienst</italic> to distribute American funds. In 1970, the bank acquired a stake in <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Zurich bank. When <italic>Trinkaus</italic> merged with <italic>Burckhardt</italic>\u2014the aryanized <italic>Hirschland</italic>\u2014three years later, <italic>Oppenheim </italic>formed <italic>Oppenheim </italic><italic>Pierson</italic> in Luxembourg with <italic>Pierson</italic>. AMRO acquired <italic>Pierson</italic> by 1975.\nAs PUs and other energy users shifted from spot oil to long-term coal contracts, liquid coal became more attractive. In 1966, America\u2019s <italic>Continental Oil</italic> bought <italic>COALH</italic>,  reinforcing energy links as <italic>Continental Oil\u2019</italic>s <italic>Mellon</italic> had connected to the Rockefellers via <italic>First Boston</italic> and <italic>OIL</italic> interests long worked with <italic>Brown Harriman</italic>. Since <italic>Brown Harriman</italic> linked with <italic>COALH</italic> by hiring Robert Ireland\u2014a grandnephew of Mark Hanna and a brother-in-law of George Humphrey\u2019s son\u2014in 1960, <italic>Brown Harriman</italic> hired UST Under-Secretary for Monetary Affairs Robert Roosa in 1965, adding federal cover. \nThe same year, <italic>Dynamics\u2014</italic>a<italic> </italic>vertically integrating conglomerate\u2014invested in a minority coal stake for full control. As DOJ sued to undo the <italic>Dynamics</italic> deal, Congressmen urged FTC to stop the <italic>COALH </italic>deal. However, reform resumed In Britain and France.\nAlthough merchant bankers had led BOE for well over a century\u2014infused with aristocratic-cousins Cobbold and Baring after WWII\u2014quarrels with BOE Governor Baring and the rise of Keynesian technocrats led PM Wilson to appoint BOE-lifer Irishman Leslie O\u2019Brien in 1966 to apply economics to stabilize the <italic>pound</italic>. The same year, Wilson\u2019s Parliament created <italic>Industrial Reorg Corp</italic> based on Italy\u2019s IRI. \nAt the time, the British iron and steel industry was among the least concentrated in the industrialized world, struggling to remain competitive with obsolete equipment and excess capacity. In 1967, <italic>Industrial Reorg </italic>nationalized the industry and fused fourteen HCs into <italic>British Steel</italic>, the world\u2019s second-largest steel producer after America\u2019s <italic>STEEL</italic>. \nThe same year, <italic>Industrial Reorg</italic> funded<italic> </italic>GEC\u2019s acquisition of AEI. But AEI\u2019s profit forecast controversy led to mandatory accounting standards in Britain. Within a year, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Poole and Kindersley convinced <italic>English Electric</italic> to merge with GEC AEI. When <italic>AMAX</italic> began producing aluminum in America in 1962, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York masterminded negotiations that led French aluminum producer<italic> Pechiney</italic> to buy <italic>Howmet</italic>, an American manufacturer of aluminum castings for aircraft. \nWithin a year, <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris syndicated public debt for ECSC. <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais</italic> was initially excluded from the syndicate but joined another for loans intended for insurance companies. By 1964, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais</italic> led the ECSC loan. \nIn late 1966, <italic>Lyonnais</italic> informed its partners that it was in a better position to act on the Paris market. <italic>Pechiney</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> decision to hire <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York as the lead lenders for a loan in 1966 outraged <italic>Lyonnais</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic>. <italic>Lyonnais</italic> described the decision as a deep wound, while <italic>Paribas</italic> expressed indignation. So, <italic>Pechiney</italic> reinstated <italic>Lyonnais</italic> as a co-leader and included <italic>Paribas</italic> in a special bracket. \nAlong with strict lending ceilings to shrink the money supply, MOF abolished FA1933-like deposit-merchant bank division and concentrated the financial sector, merging <italic>Comptoir</italic> and <italic>Nationale</italic> into <italic>National Bank of Paris</italic> (\u201cBNP\u201d). Since Maurice Schlumberger\u2019s <italic>Schlumberger</italic> bank of 1919 merged with cousins to <italic>Neuflize</italic> create <italic>Neuflize</italic> <italic>Schlumberger</italic> in 1945,<italic> Neuflize</italic> <italic>Schlumberger </italic>merged with fellow Huguenot descendants <italic>Mallet</italic><italic> </italic>in 1966 and <italic>Andr\u00e9</italic> in 1969.\nAlready France\u2019s largest investment bank in 1966, <italic>Paribas</italic> dominated bonds and stocks underwriting in the country and international borrowings in Europe. That year, <italic>Paribas</italic> participated in a group seeking control of<italic> </italic>America\u2019s <italic>Columbia Pictures Corp</italic> but settled for existing management after being thwarted by <italic>Federal Communications Commission</italic> (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulation. <italic>Paribas</italic> also formed a new banking group with <italic>Credit Industriel</italic>, established a Luxembourg HC with <italic>Bank of America</italic> to enter America as <italic>Banque Ameribas</italic>, and entered various sectors like housing, construction, management consulting, and mutual funds. \nMeanwhile, international development banks followed, including <italic>African Development Bank</italic> in 1964, <italic>Asian Development Bank</italic> in 1966, and <italic>East African Development Bank</italic> in 1967.As Nigeria collapsed into Civil War in May 1967, the Soviets aided Egypt, Syria, and Jordan with support from Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia to invade Israel in the <italic>Six Day War</italic> in June. \nAfter Israel won, Egypt closed <italic>Suez Canal</italic> and Arab oil exporters embargoed America, Britain, and West Germany for nearly a decade. With plummeting oil imports, Britain was desperate to maintain supplies, Britain supported a \u2018One Nigeria\u2019 solution. But as TRC raised production limits (unlike in 1957), American oil prices did not spike. \nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1966</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London continued to lead the gold fixing in London with prices in <italic>dollars</italic>. Having bought <italic>Shell</italic> co-founder\u2019s British merchant bank <italic>Samuel</italic> in 1963, <italic>Citi</italic> sold her shares and, alongside <italic>Lloyd </italic>Bank, acquired a large stake <italic>Grindlay</italic>, which bought 51 <italic>TURK</italic> branches across the Middle East and North Africa. Authorizing JMB to deal FX, BOE oversaw<italic> Midland</italic>\u2019s purchase of gold trader <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic>. Within a month, BOE devalued her <italic>pound</italic> to stem gold losses. \nTo expand in Britain, <italic>McKinsey</italic> appointed Alcon Copisarow her first non-American director in 1966. Lancashire-born Alcon was the son of Maurice, a Jewish chemist who fled Russia for Britain in 1908. Maurice was taken under the mentorship of chemist Chaim Weizmann, later Israel\u2019s first President. Alcon studied at <italic>Uni of Manchester </italic>and <italic>Imperial College</italic> before serving in the Royal Navy during WWII, where he worked on radar development. Transitioning into the Civil Service after the war, he was Chief Scientific Officer at the Ministry of Technology. In 1953, he married Diana Castello, Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s fourth great-granddaughter and <italic>Samuel</italic>\u2019s Samuel Montagu\u2019s second great niece.\nAt the invitation of BOE Governor Leslie O\u2019Brien in August 1968, Alcon Copisarow led <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s review of BOE from 1969 through February 1970. <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s recommendations included establishing a Policy Committee, enhancing budgetary controls, and creating a Management Services Department. These changes also involved setting up a new department for management services and computer developments and improving the Economic Intelligence Department. Concurrently, the Select Committee on Nationalized Industries conducted an inquiry from April 1969 to March 1970. \nTo bolster BOE lifer O\u2019Brien relationship with merchant banks, PM Wilson added <italic>Schr\u00f6der </italic><italic>Wagg</italic> Chair Gordon Richardson as Director. As Clore and other <italic>secondaries</italic> merged, <italic>Westminster Bank</italic> and <italic>National Provincial Bank </italic>fused into <italic>National Westminster Bank</italic> (\u201c<italic>NatWest</italic>\u201d) in 1968, which cartelized credit with other clearing banks without BOE control. \nSince <italic>McKinsey</italic> implemented a multidivisional structure for <italic>Citi</italic> in 1967,<italic>NatWest</italic>,<italic> Grindlay</italic>, and<italic> Midland</italic> sought <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s advice to adopt the multidivisional structure, while <italic>Barclay </italic>retained <italic>Urwick Orr</italic>. Likewise, John McDonald, a junior partner in <italic>McKinsey</italic> London, established the firm\u2019s German operations in 1967, forging important connections with Hermann Abs of <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> and Herbert Rohrer of <italic>Feldm\u00fchle</italic>. \nLikewise, Britain\u2019s <italic>Gas Council</italic>, overseeing twelve decentralized geographic <italic>Gas Boards</italic> appointed by the Minister, hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 1967 to restructure her organizational assignments. With cheap American energy, after <italic>Pechiney</italic> and <italic>AMAX</italic> built an aluminum reduction plant on the West Coast and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York arranged financing for <italic>Pechiney</italic> and <italic>Howmet</italic> to build a second plant in the East by 1968. \nFor a gatekeeper, <italic>McKinsey</italic> London hired Brigadier Henry Langstaff in 1966. Born in India into a family long connected with EIC, Langstaff descended from Emperor Charlemagne, the Nobel Prize winner for identifying the mosquito as the carrier of malaria, and in-laws of <italic>Niger Co</italic>\u2019s Chair from the turn of the century. Elected Partner in 1971, Langstaff led consultant training for decades in London and New York.\n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of 1970 & 1974</italic>\nSince FA1933 forbid bank-like deposit-taking, securities firms stratified into a range from business models, including advisory and dealmaking, capital markets, and high-volume retail brokerage. Although there was overlap, the former focused on high-touch service, while the latter two were capital and labor intensive. Like <italic>Lazard</italic> New York maintained a small and advisory-focused structure, <italic>Lehman</italic> operated without trading. \nAt the other extreme, <italic>Merrill</italic>, <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>, and <italic>McDonnell</italic> high-volume brokerage required numerous branch offices to cater to a retail clientele. In between, <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>Salomon</italic>, and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> provided capital markets services ranging from underwriting to trading. While the Court rejected DOJ\u2019s 1947 securities broker cartel case in 1953, competition soon increased.\nSince helping found <italic>First Boston</italic> London, Robert Boothby\u2014a son of a <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic> director, grand-nephew of former BOE Governor Cunliffe, and a second cousin of a Baring\u2014maintained a publicly heterosexual identity, navigating gay social circles with political caution while denying physical involvement. In 1954, amidst a growing concern over homosexuality and prostitution in British cities, a committee led by Sir John Wolfenden was formed to review the existing laws on these matters. \nMiriam Rothschild assembled a group of biologists and zoologists to submit a report on homosexuality and genetics. This report, though omitting her name, advocated against criminalizing private homosexual acts between consenting adults and highlighted the predominant genetic component. Despite its modest recommendations, including setting the age of consent at 21, these ideas eventually contributed to the 1967 decriminalization of homosexual behavior in Britain. Miriam\u2019s efforts were motivated by a desire to end the threat of blackmail against gay men, reflecting her own experiences as an openly bisexual woman in a homophobic society.\nIn America, meanwhile, Congress appointed a subcommittee that recommended firing homosexuals from government jobs and directing FBI and police to identify them. By 1953, moral purity became prerequisites for government employment. Not even privilege allowed gay bankers to acknowledging their truth publicly. \nBorn to an North Carolina insurance salesman, Richard Jenrette served as sergeant with the National Guard before enrolled in <italic>Harvard</italic> Business as an affirmative action candidate as a Southerner and then became a portfolio manager at<italic> </italic><italic>Brown Harriman</italic>. He soon met William Donaldson, who studied at <italic>Yale</italic> and served as a Marine Corps lieutenant before attending <italic>Harvard</italic> Business and becoming head of <italic>Walker</italic>\u2019s buying department. \nAlong with <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business classmate Dan Lufkin\u2014a grandson of <italic>Texaco</italic>\u2019s Chair, grandnephew of <italic>Edison</italic> executive Thomas Murray, and cousin of Irish Catholic broker <italic>McDonnell</italic>\u2019s Thomas McDonnell\u2014they became independent stock researching analysts. Buying a NYSE seat, they formed <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic> as a research boutique in 1959. Within a year, Lufkin wed a <italic>WR Grace</italic> conglomerate heiress. While Jenrette met William Thompson in 1965 and developing a 45-year relationship, he concealed it, introducing Thompson as the house manager and relegating him to the back stairwell when entertaining guests.\nIn 1958, <italic>Loeb</italic> funded Eddie Gilbert, unrelated to <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Seymour Gilbert but heir to a private New York lumber business, to take over <italic>Bruce</italic>, a Memphis hardwood manufacturer, in the first short squeeze stock corner since 1922. As Gilbert launched a takeover of <italic>Celotex</italic>, an insulation producer, with unorthodox methods in 1961, <italic>Loeb</italic> cut off Gilbert\u2019s credit. So, Gilbert sold <italic>Bruce</italic> convertible bonds to Andr\u00e9 Meyer to buy <italic>Celotex</italic> on margin. While Meyer pulled credit as the pair as <italic>Celotex</italic> prices grew, Gilbert was left illiquid when NYSE fell in 1962 and fled to Brazil. While Gilbert eventually returned to serve prison time, Meyer completed the deal.\nMore than Jews, <italic>Loeb</italic> focused on political elites while crafting businesses. In 1962, <italic>Loeb</italic> hired radio executive Lloyd Taft, a grandson President Taft and son of Senator Taft. Back in 1948, <italic>Loeb</italic> invested $0.8 million in <italic>Texas Natural Gas Co</italic> and $10 million in <italic>Union Sulphur Co</italic> in 1954. In 1960, these companies merged into <italic>Union Texas Natural Gas Co</italic>. <italic>Loeb</italic> then facilitated the split and liquidation of <italic>Anderson-Prichard Oil Corp</italic>, selling its producing properties to <italic>Union Texas</italic> and forming <italic>Apco Oil Corp</italic>. In 1962, <italic>Allied Chemical</italic> acquired <italic>Union Texas</italic>. Although Eugene Meyer founded <italic>Allied Chemical</italic> in 1920, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> was her investment banker through the 1950s. Later, during a bond issue meeting for <italic>Allied Chemical</italic>, <italic>Loeb</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York successfully negotiated a joint management role with <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. Along with Andr\u00e9 Meyer,<italic> Allied Chemical</italic>\u2019s board included <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Richard Perkins.\nSince FA1933 virtually eliminated Jews from commercial banks, insurers, and large companies until the deregulation of the 1980s, when Protestant <italic>Morgan </italic>NB and other banks, securities firms, and law firms began hiring Jews and other minorities. In 1951, before the Civil Rights movement, the number of Blacks in high-trust positions ranging from banks managers to board directors, particularly in New York City and Los Angeles, grew to nearly 500, with over half in Manhattan and sixteen in <italic>TransAmerica</italic> on the West Coast. \nAlthough Jews accounted for 8% of college-educated populace in 1960, executive roles in leading American corporations saw Jewish graduates outnumbered by over 30 to 1. In major banks, only 4% of 844 top executives were Jewish. About 1% of executives in six major Philadelphia banks were Jewish, despite Jews comprising 15% of the city\u2019s population. \nSimilarly, in Washington, DC, and New York, Jewish representation in banking leadership roles was low, with Jews occupying less than 1% of senior and middle management positions, despite sizable Jewish populations in both areas. This pattern persisted in the top 50 commercial banks nationwide, where Jewish individuals held less than 2% of executive roles. The same situation existed in FRS, which had no Jewish Chairs since the 1930s until Arthur Burns in the 1970s. Likewise, no Jew chaired FDIC until <italic>Seidman</italic>\u2019s William Seidman in 1985.\nWhile some Jews earned over $10,000, they mostly held sales or technical roles where talent counts more than \u2018appearance.\u2019 Only talent-driven sectors like Wall Street offered Jews advancement. Lewis Bernard was <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s first Jewish partner, albeit at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. Lewis\u2019 father Herbert had been president of <italic>Shuttleworth Carton Co</italic> and helped build a national association to limit competition in the paper industry by 1962. As Lewis graduated <italic>Princeton</italic> and LSE, he joined <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> in 1963, becoming the firm\u2019s youngest partner in 1973.\nBoris Berkovitch became one of the first Jews to hold a top executive position at <italic>Morgan </italic>by working with Protestant Oren Root as a banking regulator and lawyer. Root, a Pomeroy cousin and great-nephew of former President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s Secretary of State Elihu Root, helped organize Wendell Willkie\u2019s Republican presidential campaign in 1940. \nAfter serving in the Navy during WWII, he co-founded the law firm <italic>Root</italic> <italic>Barrett Cohen Knapp Smith</italic> in 1946. Root joined Governor Nelson Rockefeller\u2019s administration in 1959 and served as New York State Superintendent of Banks from 1961 to 1964. During his tenure, New York allowed BHCs to expand across the state. Root oversaw mergers between New York City banks and those in Nassau and Westchester counties, though some of these mergers were later vetoed by FRS.\nBerkovitch, Root\u2019s First Deputy Superintendent, assisted in managing these mergers and navigating regulatory challenges. Both men dealt with issues such as \u201chome office protection,\u201d which restricted branch openings in certain communities. Berkovitch immigrated to America as a child with his Jewish parents in the 1920s when his father represented the first Soviet-American trading company. \nGraduating <italic>New York Uni</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic> Law, Berkovitch served in the military WWII, where he attained the rank of Captain. Although he was considered a potential successor, both he and Root resigned from the Banking Department in 1964 to join Root\u2019s law firm. Root later joined <italic>Irving Trust</italic> as Counsel in 1965, while Berkovitch joined <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Guaranty</italic> in 1966 as Senior Vice President and General Counsel.\nEli Blachowitz \u201cBlack\u201d born in Lublin, Poland, came from a long line of rabbis. His father was the first in the family to leave post-WWI Poland to New York in 1920s. Black graduated from <italic>Yeshiva Uni</italic> in 1940 and became a rabbi in Long Island. Discontent with his role, he transitioned into business, joining <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1946 and later <italic>American Securities Corp</italic>. In 1954, he became Chair and CEO of <italic>American Seal-Kap</italic>. By 1970, he merged with <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s client <italic>United Fruit Co</italic>, transforming it into <italic>United Brands Co</italic>. He improved labor conditions and wages in Central America reforming the company\u2019s image as a \u2018Yankee exploiter.\u2019 Notably, Black negotiated personally with Cesar Chavez\u2019s <italic>United Farm Workers Union</italic>, being the first major lettuce grower to sign with the union.\nFrom the post-WWII boom, several Jews significantly impacted New York City\u2019s real estate sector. Harry Uris played a key role in city development. Julius Tishman was involved in 13% of the city\u2019s new office buildings during this period. Samuel LeFrak and William Zeckendorf were prominent in real estate promotion. Born in Poland, Eugene Horbach survived a German forced labor camp during WWII and immigrated to Washington state in 1950. Turning to real estate, his business began to grow steadily in the 1960s and boomed after. \nLikewise, the sons of Russian Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn, Bob and Larry Tisch expanded their parent\u2019s hotel investments. Their pinnacle achievement came in 1956 with the construction of the $17 million <italic>Americana Hotel</italic> in Florida. So when a DOJ antitrust suit forced MGM to divest <italic>Loew</italic> theaters in 1959, the Tisches bought it for real estate holdings, swiftly liquidating 50 theaters. This was just the beginning of the move and entertainment industry reorganization.\nMeanwhile, Jews partnered with fellow Catholic minorities. In real estate, the son of a Brooklyn grocer, Sol Goldman\u2014unrelated to <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2014built a real estate empire with <italic>Brooklyn College </italic>Law graduate Alex DiLorenzo, the son of a local real estate and mortgage office. Since forming in 1951, <italic>Goldman DiLorenzo</italic> began buying properties in Manhattan from 1955, and acquiring the <italic>Chrysler Building</italic> from William Zeckendorf during the <italic>Panic of 1960</italic>. \nThe same year, <italic>Carter Berlind Potoma Weill</italic> registered with NYSE under Potoma, the only non-Jewish partner. Sanford Weill became the most prominent of the partners. He had begun as a runner for <italic>Bear </italic>before joining <italic>Burnham</italic>. While Jewish Kentucky distiller and New York clothing merchant heirs founded <italic>Bear</italic> after WWI,<italic> </italic>the grandson of a Jewish Kentucky bourbon distiller (and extended cousin of Cincinnati clothing merchants)<italic> </italic>started <italic>Burnham</italic> in 1935.\nNot closely related to <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Weill family, Sanford\u2019s maternal grandfather fled Russian Poland after the 1905 pogroms and became a successful dressmaker for funerals in New York City, where his daughter married into the rabbinical Weill family. However, post-WWII price gouging investigation forced the venture to close. Still, <italic>Loeb</italic> refused to clear for them. \nBut no longer did bankers have to be privileged. Amidst the trans-Atlantic securities taxes of the 1960s, <italic>Arnhold</italic><italic> Bleichr\u00f6der </italic>of New York hired Jewish Hungarian refugee George Soros to sell offshore hedge fund services to foreigners interested in American securities. Before leaving to start <italic>Soros</italic>, he presciently bought REITs in 1969, BHC stocks in 1971, and oil and food in 1972.\nNor did securities financiers have to be men. Likewise, Isabel Benham, born to a Presbyterian Reverend in Buffalo, New York, graduated <italic>Bryn Mawr</italic> and trained at <italic>Guaranty Trust</italic>\u2019s bond school in 1931, but sold magazines until joining RFC. After Congress sterilized the politicized RFC in 1932, Benham transitioned to an analyst role at <italic>Pressprich</italic>. Heading of <italic>Pressprich</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> railroad research department from 1940, she advised railroads on mergers. By 1948, she became president of New York\u2019s <italic>Women</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Bond Club</italic>. Heading of <italic>Pressprich</italic>\u2019s railroad research department from 1940, Isabel Benham devised innovative financial strategies for rail carriers and proposed ideas for railway mergers. Along with securing a government loan for <italic>Chicago & Eastern</italic> <italic>Illinois</italic> RR, she advised <italic>Seaboard Airline</italic> RR\u2019s merger with <italic>Western Pacific</italic> RR. \nFemale NYSE brokers also reappeared for the first time since the 1870s. After Partner of <italic>AM</italic> <italic>Kidder</italic> (not related to <italic>Kidder Peabody</italic>), oil-tycoon, and CIA-co-founder Charles Bay died in 1956, his widow Josephine chaired <italic>AM</italic> <italic>Kidder </italic>until her death in 1962, when her second husband took over the firm and closed it in 1963. \nDiscrimination also led minority entrepreneurs to start their own firms. From 1971, <italic>Lumbee Guaranty Bank</italic> of Pembroke, North Carolina became the first, and for a long time largest, Native American owned bank. Since Chow Chan founded <italic>Cathay Bank</italic> in 1962 as Southern California\u2019s first (and for a decade only) Asian-American commercial bank after experiencing bank and regulator discrimination, they founded <italic>East-West </italic>S&L, the Asian community\u2019s first S&L by 1973. And in 1974, another Chinese immigrant established America\u2019s first Asian-American-owned federally chartered bank, <italic>Far East</italic> NB in Los Angeles\u2019 Chinatown. After <italic>International Bank of Commerce</italic> (\u201cIBC\u201d) started in 1966 in Laredo, Texas, IBC soon grew to become America\u2019s largest minority-owned BHC.\nWhile there were no big Jewish law firms through 1950, continuing hiring discrimination led Jewish firms to grow at twice the rate of traditional Protestant firms to account for six of the twenty largest law firms by 1965. Black law firms gradually emerged, with the first \u2018real\u2019 Black firm dedicated to serving business clients established in Cleveland in the 1940s. Despite these efforts, Black lawyers still represented only a small proportion of associates and partners in large law firms. The son of a Black Postal Service employee in Baltimore, Reginald Lewis played football at <italic>Virginia State Uni</italic>, and was recruited by <italic>Harvard </italic>Law<italic> </italic>as part of the country\u2019s first big affirmative action program in 1965 before practicing corporate law at <italic>Paul Weiss</italic>, the Jewish big law firm. \nSimilarly, Black-owned LICs saw a 25% increase as LICs grew volumes 164% in the 1960s. <italic>Supreme</italic> LIC was one of the stars. In the early 1950s, Earl Dickerson became more involved in management. He initiated significant changes, rising to CEO by 1955. Dickerson revamped the administrative structure, establishing a modern profit and expense control system. He replaced Gibson as president and, in 1956, renovated the headquarters and made acquisitions, including <italic>Domestic</italic> LIC of Louisville in 1961, leading to record profits. Likewise, since Maceo Walker inherited the presidency of <italic>Universal</italic> LIC of Memphis in 1952, he joined President Eisenhower\u2019s <italic>Person to Person Committee</italic> in 1956. As <italic>Universal </italic>LIC and <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> employed their facilities for planning local sit-ins and offering bail funds for protesters.\nGenerally easier entry allowed Bernard Madoff used<italic> </italic>savings from lifeguarding to start BLMIS broker in 1960. Developing computer systems for automated trading system, Madoff helped lead the small broker union, NASD. As America\u2019s Court allowed off-the-floor-trades in 1962, competition felled brokers. Since brokers could not make markets if they segregated customer funds, BA1938\u2019s \u00a760(e) lowered customer priority. This issue soon became important.\nThe Salad Oil Scandal of 1963 began with Anthony DeAngelis\u2019 <italic>Allied Crude</italic> buying soybean oil futures in anticipation of a Spanish government deal, which fell through. Attempting to offset losses, <italic>Allied Crude</italic> acquired cottonseed and soybean oil futures. As oil prices fell, <italic>Allied Crude</italic> went bankrupt leading to the suspension of <italic>Williston Beane</italic> and the large Jewish-owned <italic>Haupt</italic> brokers by NYSE. The depressed commodity prices may also have felled Britain\u2019s <italic>Knowles Foster</italic> private bank. While SA1933\u2019s draft included exchange-listed securities, the final act only exempted municipal, small firm, and OTC from registration. As SEC reaffirmed small firms, SA1964 extended SA1933 to large OTC. Because of \u00a760(e) following the failure of <italic>Haupt</italic> in 1963, NYSE created a <italic>Trust Fund</italic> with NYSE receivers to wind down brokers. \nOn the West Coast, Boyd Jefferies founded <italic>Jefferies</italic> in Los Angeles in 1962, initially in a telephone booth at <italic>Pacific Coast Stock Exchange</italic>. In its early years, the firm specialized in trading listed stocks in the emerging \u2018<italic>third market</italic>\u2019, where stocks were traded outside traditional exchanges to prioritize privacy and negotiated commissions for institutional clients. They innovatively introduced split commissions in 1964, enabling them to serve clients and share commissions with other brokerage firms. By 1965, <italic>Jefferies</italic> expanded and joined various stock exchanges, including Detroit, Midwest, Boston, and Philadelphia.\nAs WWII Allies\u2014America, Sweden, Britain, and the\u2014de-industrialized from coal manufacturing to financial services, Japan and Italy (and Germany, to a lesser extent) rebuilt with re-industrialization. Since WWII, Japan particularly benefited from cheap Iranian oil. Like Poland for East Europe, Germany supplied ECSC coal. De-industrialization replaced coal mining with low-cost overseas oil and coal imports from the 1960s. Cheap oil promoted car manufactures, with America, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan leading production.\nAlthough the 1951 <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> that created ECSC primarily focused on regulating the steel industry against German concentration, it allowed oligopoly. In 1957, the <italic>Treaty of Rome</italic> extended the common competition rules to other industries, reducing barriers to trade and increasing competition. By 1960, France opposed <italic>Thyssen</italic>\u2019s merger with another German steel company, citing concerns about reconcentration. As a result, ECSC\u2019s High Authority imposed stringent conditions on the merger, prompting <italic>Thyssen</italic> to withdraw its request. In 1962, ECSC agreed to competition laws that required notifications of existing and future cartels, but without an independent authority. France and Germany continued to control steel and agricultural prices through cartels, production coordination, bilateral agreements, and subsidies, despite the <italic>High Authority</italic>\u2019s enforcement powers. \nECSC member states pursued their own national strategic policies without European coordination, often favoring market concentration and price stabilization. EC banned parallel automobile trade between France and Germany due to vertical restraints in 1964. The following year, EC granted block exemptions for bilateral exclusive dealing, including vertical cartels in distribution agreements related to the automobile industry, which reduced inter-brand competition. The same year, a group of steelmakers sought permission from the ECSC to cartelize steel subject to regulation by the <italic>High Authority</italic>, but rumors of the <italic>High Authority</italic> suggesting a \u2018crisis cartel\u2019 to stabilize prices drew complaints from the Dutch press in 1966, ensuring continued competition. \nWhile <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> continued to dominate British engineering, <italic>Kuhn</italic> had banked IT&T after the founder retired. To conglomerate under new leadership from 1959, IT&T hired <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Felix Rohatyn. <italic>Kuhn</italic> also hired extended Rothschild cousin and Anglo-French banker Andr\u00e9 Istel as he resigned from his <italic>Schlumberger</italic>-affiliated <italic>Istel </italic>securities firm. However, France continued protecting strategic industries from foreign control. As <italic>Kuhn-</italic>banked <italic>Westinghouse</italic> bought a Brussels-based engineer and eyed British firms, France prohibited her and IT&T from buying firms and abolished FA1933-like deposit-merchant bank division by 1966. \nItaly, however, was up for grabs. After WWII, IRI leader Alberto Beneduce tasked his son-in-law, Enrico Cuccia, with founding <italic>MedioBanca</italic> to bank northern Italian industry in 1946. <italic>MedioBanca</italic> and similar institutes made medium-term loans in small and medium-sized enterprises. In 1953, Italy promoted southern industry with regional development banks. To protect <italic>MedioBanca</italic> from interference, Cuccia went to New York to talk to Rockefeller, who referred Cuccia to Meyer as FA1933 forbid <italic>Chase</italic> from investing. By 1955, Meyer and <italic>Lehman</italic> invested in <italic>MedioBanca</italic> with state-owned banks and industrial families. By 1957, Italy allowed <italic>MedioBanca</italic> and other development banks to lend to the south. \nFor SEC in America, <italic>Lehman</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> New York used their partnership with <italic>MedioBanca </italic>to set a precedent in an international capital syndicate for <italic>Fiat</italic>. Born into a noble landowning family that was involved in founding <italic>Martini Rossi</italic>, Giovanni Agnelli married the daughter of an admiral and started <italic>Fiat</italic> in 1899. His son Edward married the daughter of a Tuscan nobleman, but young, leading Giovanni to turn to Vittorio Valletta, who turned <italic>Fiat</italic> into Italy\u2019s largest car manufacturer from 1921. \nAfter WWII, Edward\u2019s children married into nobility. Clara Agnelli married Prince Tassilo F\u00fcrstenberg, Gianni married Neapolitan princess Marella Caracciolo, whose brother soon founded newspaper group <italic>L</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Espresso-La Repubblica</italic>, and Umberto married the daughter of a Roman princess and Enrico Piaggio, who owned <italic>Vespa</italic> scooter company<italic> Piaggio</italic>. \nMeyer also advised the Agnelli family\u2019s other interests, such as the sale of a photographic materials company to American 3M in 1963. After Enrico Piaggio died in 1965, Umberto Agnelli took over <italic>Piaggio</italic>. The following year, Valletta died after running the company for 21 years and Gianni succeeded him. Increasingly Gianni worked with Meyer. When France refused to approve <italic>Fiat</italic>\u2019s takeover of <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> from <italic>Michelin</italic> in 1968,<italic> Lazard</italic> Paris collaborated with <italic>Lazard</italic> New York as intermediaries between <italic>Fiat</italic> and <italic>Michelin</italic>, and Meyer negotiated a minority interest and distribution agreement with the PM.\nAs America de-industrialized, railroad, coal, and labor cartels competed with oil and gas. For passenger roads, Congress allowed ICC to discontinue insolvent routes and guarantee debt in 1958. But few roads applied. For freight, ICC forbade bulk discounts, so energy used pipes, trucks, and wires. While <italic>Pressprich</italic> helped coal roads from Alabama to West Virginia merge in the 1950s, pressure on Eastern roads grew as collective bargaining and strikes blocked cost rationalization. Even FDR\u2019s union law drafter, Richberg, published a book on how labor unions attracted Marxism in 1957. \nWhile some countries instituted compulsory arbitration\u2014along with New York and Pennsylvania PUs\u2014most labor disputes settled unilaterally. By 1962, President Kennedy supported federal unions representation by executive order for employees, and states passed laws to guide public work demands into collective bargaining. While President Kennedy averted a railroad strike by creating the Emergency Board in 1963, it dissolved after his assassination. From then, President Johnson\u2019s Congress intervened numerous times to address rail labor and management disputes with temporary arbitration measures.\nMeanwhile, corporations acquired NOCs. By buying startups, mature companies grew prospects with lower risk. Acquirers\u2019 shareholders gained lower tax rates than if they sold to reinvest dividends into companies with NOCs. So, they traded in appreciated and illiquid shares for long-term stakes in diverse conglomerates that could be used as collateral while deferring taxes using the <italic>General Utilities</italic> <italic>Doctrine</italic> (\u201cGUD\u201d). As firms increasingly conglomerated, the Court supported DOJ under AA1950 to block asset purchase mergers in vertically and horizontally related industries in 1962. \nAmerica continued importing oil. Local gas investment fell as the Court allowed DOJ to block asset mergers in related industries under AA1950. Moreover, despite the Court rulings, states continued protectionist oil and gas production controls. So, <italic>Hunt</italic> and other non-integrated American oil companies grew oil imports. Hoping to promote oil imports from less risky North America since the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> <italic>Crisis </italic>of 1956, Congress set import quotas on overseas oil in 1959, subsidizing independent refiners at the cost of integrated majors. Saudi Arabia reacted by forming a producer cartel, <italic>Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</italic> (\u201cOPEC\u201d). \nAlong with overseas energy competition, Congress privatized nuclear energy in 1964, retaining caps on nuclear tort liabilities since 1954. Energy competition did not bode well for America\u2019s unionized coal industry. America\u2019s ICC oversaw railroad securities, not SEC. To assist insolvent roads, ICC forced mergers. As the <italic>Hudson </italic>filed for bankruptcy in 1962, ICC approved <italic>Port Authority</italic>\u2019s<italic> World Trade Center</italic> after they bought <italic>Hudson</italic>. Likewise, coal-heavy <italic>PENN</italic> petitioned to buy <italic>Central</italic> to form <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic><italic> </italic>from 1962. That year, <italic>PENN</italic> heiress Mary Roberts Clark and Governor Nelson  Rockefeller divorced since marrying in 1930.\nSince law and <italic>Morgan</italic> NB director Thomas Perkins\u2014of unknown relation to others of that name\u2014joined <italic>PENN</italic>\u2019s board in 1959, <italic>PENN</italic><italic> </italic>recruited <italic>Norfolk & Western</italic> RR\u2019s President Stuart Saunders as Chair and CEO in 1963. That same year, he was elected a director of <italic>Chase</italic>. Instead of furloughing workers without severance as was commonly done, <italic>PENN</italic> bought out contracts to avert strikes<italic>,</italic> acquired non-railroads, and sold insolvent <italic>Long Island RR</italic> to New York\u2019s new <italic>Metro Transportation Authority</italic> (\u201cMTA\u201d) with the endorsement of Governor Rockefeller. As ICC linked the approval for forming <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic> to the purchase of a bankrupt road, competitors sued against the merger in 1966.\nThat winter, snow shuttered insolvent New York City for a week. But as PUs and other energy users shifted from spot oil to long-term coal contracts, liquid coal became more attractive. In 1966, <italic>Continental Oil</italic> bought <italic>COALH</italic> and <italic>Dynamics\u2014</italic>a<italic> </italic>vertically integrating conglomerate\u2014invested in a minority coal stake for full control. As DOJ sued to undo the <italic>Dynamics</italic> deal, Congressmen urged FTC to stop the <italic>COALH </italic>deal. \nMeanwhile, as <italic>Carter Berlind Potoma Weill</italic>\u2019s Potoma\u2019s drinking habits came close to violating NYSE\u2019s rules, his Jewish partners bought him out. By 1965, the firm became <italic>Carter Berlind Weill Levitt</italic> (\u201cCBWL\u201d) by adding Arthur Levitt. (Levitt\u2019s father was elected New York Comptroller with Governor Averell Harriman\u2019s support in 1955, serving a record tenure after being reelected five times until 1978. \nWhile he unsuccessfully ran for mayor in 1961, he chaired the Democratic state convention in 1965 and acted the state\u2019s national convention delegate after.) As Sanford Weill became Chair, he made the first of his many acquisitions by integrating <italic>Bernstein Macauley</italic> two years later. By 1968, Sanford hired Frank Zarb from <italic>Goodyear</italic> to manage the multiplying accumulation paper recording stock settlements in the back office.\nBefore his assassination in 1963, President Kennedy appointed his brother-in-law Sargent Shriver first Director of <italic>Peace Corps</italic> and his brother as attorney general. By 1967, Congress passed a law to prevent family members from being hired by federal officials to agencies they oversee. Potential loopholes exist, like using unofficial roles, such as \u2018consultant\u2019, to bypass the law. \nSince his radio station WMCA promoted Kennedy in 1960, Peter Straus of <italic>Macy</italic>\u2019s served as a campaign manager for Robert Kennedy\u2019s successful 1964 Senate run in New York. While President Johnson appointed Straus in charge of African affairs of <italic>Agency for International Development</italic> (\u201cUSAID\u201d) and Shriver as first Director of EEOC following the<italic> Rights Act of 1964</italic>, with <italic>Jones Beach</italic><italic></italic><italic></italic>-heiress Mary Gardiner Jones as FTC\u2019s first female commissioner. \nJones never married or had children. Like widows, single female bankers chose work over marriage. In 1964, <italic>Pressprich</italic> promoted railroad analyst Isabel Benham as the firm\u2019s first female partner, making her the first female partner at a major broker. Of her many clients, the management of L&N was one of the few to still avoid women on analyst trips. Only in 1967, did Jewish Muriel Siebert form NYSE\u2019s first female broker, banked by <italic>Chase</italic>. Researching stocks since the 1950s, Siebert remained the only woman to hold a NYSE seat for a decade. Like Benham, Siebert lived to 2013 without marrying or having children. While Benham left <italic>Pressprich</italic> to join <italic>Shearson</italic> as VP and established a railroad department in 1968, she never married or had children. \nOther female investment bankers married without committing to a firm. In 1966, <italic>Kuhn</italic> hired Phyllis Ross as an international finance associate after she graduated <italic>Stanford</italic> Business. She left in 1970 after marriage and spent several years with <italic>Trans World Airlines</italic>, joining <italic>Lazard</italic> New York as an M&A associate in 1976 for three years. After a year as <italic>American Can</italic>\u2019s M&A Director, she became an M&A VP at <italic>Bear</italic> until going independent with <italic>Ross</italic> in 1985. By 1967, two years after giving birth, Polish-immigrant and former-model Martha Kostrya Stewart followed her father-in-law to become a broker at <italic>Pearlberg Monness Williams Sidel</italic>. She left in 1973 to start a catering business. One reason they left was that banking became less profitable after the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>. \nAt <italic>Citi</italic> NB in 1967, only 50 women became officers in the previous 10 years, with an average of five promotions annually. <italic>Citi</italic> CEO Walter Wriston faced challenges promoting women, and in 1963, he managed to elevate Zelda Wakeman, his <italic>Fletcher School</italic> classmate, to the rank of Assistant Cashier by withholding her gender from the Board. It took until late 1971 for <italic>Citi</italic> to appoint its first female VP, again being Zelda Wakeman. Wriston consistently urged his top officers to improve their efforts in promoting women, foreigners, and minorities to top positions. Still in 1974, he expressed disappointment that out of 163 top positions, only six were occupied by foreign nationals, and none were held by Blacks or women.\nSince <italic>Harvard</italic> only accepted men, closely associated <italic>Radcliffe</italic> College educated women in Cambridge. The granddaughter of Boston Brahmin Adams, Helen Homans had married Carl Gilbert. Gilbert was the brother of deceased <italic>Morgan </italic>partner Seymour Gilbert, whose widow married <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Harold Stanley, kinterlinking <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. \nBy 1950, Helen joined <italic>Radcliffe</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s board of trustees and served on the board until 1976 and chaired it from 1955 to 1972, while her husband became CEO of <italic>Gillette</italic>. During her tenure, she oversaw presidential searches, led capital campaigns, acted as interim president, and helped merge with <italic>Harvard </italic>College in 1963, as the latter first accepting women. By 1970, she was elected the first woman and non-<italic>Harvard</italic> alumna to serve as Overseer from 1970 and Chair in 1975 before <italic>Radcliffe</italic> fully integrated with <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1977.\nLikewise, Seymour\u2019s son, Seymour Parker Jr, marred an <italic>OIL</italic> heiress Auchincloss and began his career at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> in 1960, making partner by 1969. Meanwhile, Harold Stanley\u2019s brother-in-law, Hugh Knowlton remained a <italic>Kuhn</italic> partner, whose son, Hugh Stanley Knowlton, became President and CEO of <italic>Smith Barney</italic> in 1968. The same year, <italic>Smith Barney</italic> hired John Adams Morgan\u2014John Morgan\u2019s great-grandson, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> co-founder Henry Morgan\u2019s son, and Helen Homans\u2019 first cousin once removed\u2014from Chicago investment bank <italic>Dominick</italic> as a VP and promoted him to Vice Chair by 1977.\nAs <italic>Kuhn</italic> marked her centennial in 1967, leadership was held by John Schiff and Frederick Warburg, third-generation descendants of the firm\u2019s founders. They were supported by an operating committee led by Nathaniel Samuels. A Chicago-born <italic>Harvard</italic> graduate, Samuels practiced international law, and worked at BGGE before joining <italic>Kuhn</italic> in 1955. He became a partner in 1959 and expanded the firm\u2019s international business, working with Malaysia, Peru, and Mexico\u2019s first American bond sale in 50 years. Elected Managing Partner in 1966, Samuels served as Deputy Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs from 1969 to 1972.\nThe committee also included Bernard Einhorn, Alvin Friedman, Kenneth Hall, Henry Necarsulmer, and Morris Wright. During this period, new partners included former New York Governor Thomas Dewey\u2019s son Thomas Dewey Jr and Jerome Katzin, both with SEC experience. Anthony Lund, connected to the British military and the CIA network of Russian aristocracy, and Yves-Andres Istel, son of the late partner and Samson Wertheim\u2019s descendant Andr\u00e9 Istel, also joined, focusing on international finance. \nAlongside these outside partners, heirs joined the firm, with John Schiff\u2019s son David becoming the first of the fifth generation in the family to enter the partnership. Limited partner Gilbert Kahn, son of Otto Kahn, represented the fourth generation, while his nephew John Ryan III, great-grandson of founding partner Abraham Wolff and grandson of Otto Kahn and Thomas Ryan, joined in 1957, became a general partner in 1969, and led the trading department. As in the 1930s, over half of the partners were not Jewish, including the Schiff and Kahn heirs, Knowlton, Dewey, Lund, Hall, and Wright. While <italic>Lehman</italic> hired George Baker III\u2014a <italic>First NB of New York</italic> heir and John Schiff\u2019s nephew\u2014in the 1960s, he left to start a firm.\nAs a Mormon, Morris Wright tapped into a powerful minority middleman network. In banking, former FRS Chair Marriner Stoddard Eccles\u2019 family led and their Stoddard cousins expanded <italic>Michigan</italic> NB, David Kennedy was Chair of <italic>Continental Illinois</italic>, and Anthony Eyring was President of <italic>Washington Mutual Savings Bank</italic>. In industry, Jay Parkinson was President of <italic>Anaconda</italic>, Robert Bradford chaired <italic>American Smelting & Refining</italic>, and Isaac Stewart was VP at <italic>Union Carbide</italic>. In other sectors, Oakley Evans was VP at <italic>JC Penney</italic>, Lew Callaway was publisher of <italic>Newsweek</italic>, John McLean Clifford was President of <italic>Curtis Publishing</italic>, and the Marriott family owned a large hotel empire. \nA cousin-in-law of Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith, Eccles, and Marriott, George Romney started at automobile manufacturer <italic>Nash </italic>in 1948. <italic>Nash</italic> merged with <italic>Hudson Motor </italic>in 1952 to create <italic>American Motor</italic> George became CEO. In 1962, George left to become a three-term Governor of Michigan and ran for the 1968 Republican Presidential nomination, though he lost to Richard Nixon.\nAmidst the endogenous marriage partnerships, Wall Street firms remained divided by religion. However, during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a shift. While <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>Lehman</italic>, and <italic>Kuhn</italic> had senior Jewish executives, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, <italic>First Boston</italic>, <italic>Dillon</italic>, <italic>Harriman Ripley</italic>, and <italic>Kidder Peabody </italic>primarily hired Anglican Protestants. <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> hired her first Jewish director in 1963, <italic>Morgan </italic>NB did not have a high-ranking Jewish officer until the 1980s. \n<italic>Kidder</italic>\u2019s corporate finance department did not hire a Jew until 1971. <italic>Merrill </italic>was a \u2018Catholic\u2019 firm for a time. Despite continuing claims that Jews controlled banking in the early 1970s, America\u2019s 25 largest banks had only one Jew among 377 senior managers, 38 among 3,027 middle managers, and 26 Jews among 491 officers. Since FA1933 virtually eliminated Jews from banks, insurers, and large companies until the 1980s, when <italic>Morgan </italic>and other Protestant banks, securities firms, and law firms began hiring Jews and other minorities.\nThat lone senior Jews in commercial banking was likely Richard Rosenberg. Rosenberg grew up in near poverty when his haberdasher father was evicted during the <italic>Great Depression</italic>. Instead, he committed to service. After serving in the <italic>Korean War</italic> and spending 12 years in Naval Reserves, Rosenberg joined <italic>Crocker</italic> NB selling payroll services in 1959. While using his GI Bill to earn an MBA and LLB at <italic>Golden Gate Uni</italic> parttime, he spent 22 years at the long-Jewish <italic>Wells Fargo</italic>, moving up in marketing and advertising positions to the finance side, becoming EVP in 1975 and Vice Chair in 1980.\nThe largest Catholic broker, <italic>McDonnel</italic><italic>,</italic> had offices in 26 American cities, including 3 in New York, and one in Paris, Thomas Murray McDonnell began modernizing the firm with computers by 1962. However, despite their aristocratic-like marriages, divorces accelerated as Thomas\u2019 sisters split from Alfred Vanderbilt in 1956 and <italic>Ford</italic> CEO Henry Ford II in 1964. In less than year, Henry Ford II remarried, and his daughters with Annie McDonnell wed Giancarlo Uzielli and thrice divorced Niarchos, who divorced again in 1967. \nWhile McDonnell\u2019s brother-in-law Cooley became President of <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> in 1966, they divorced soon after. Since divorcing Aristotle Onassis in 1960, Athina Livanos married Duke of Marlborough John Vanderbilt Spencer-Churchill and then Niarchos in 1971. By then Onassis married President Kennedy\u2019s widow, Jacqueline, in 1968 until his death in 1975. (Still, it was Andr\u00e9 Meyer who multiplied Jacqueline\u2019s trust into a fortune.)\nSecond tier firms were more flexible. One of <italic>Shearson</italic>\u2019s top financiers was Greek Orthodox Theodore Dimon. Like his father before him, Dimon built a clientele among fellow Greek-Americans. The elder Dimon was born Panos Papademetriou and was a banker in Smyrna and married a relative of the Mostra family, which included Spyridon Mostra, a senior official at <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, as well as other senior military and political leaders. \nImmigrating to New York in 1921, Panos changed his surname and worked at a recently opened <italic>Bank of Athens</italic> New York, which was owned by <italic>Parisienne</italic> and Chiot shipping manganates, until joining <italic>Shearson</italic> in 1949. Likewise, <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic> Rome hired Minos Zombanakis from <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic> as her Near and Middle East representative in 1958. On the other hand, overcoming religious obstacles, Catholic banker Kenneth Langone grew<italic> Pressprich</italic>, he refocused from railroads as Congress promoted insurer and lease financing. \nWhile IBM only leased computers until 1956, DOJ forced her to sell to processor lessors. So, Ross Perot started <italic>Electronic Data Systems</italic> (\u201cEDS\u201d) and<italic> </italic>Saul Cohen Steinberg set up<italic> Leasco</italic> by 1962. As PA1935 limited HC bonds and financial director interlocks, PUHCs relied on bank loans and LIC private debt. (Directors of New York\u2019s <italic>Consolidated Edison</italic> in 1962 were mostly from firms related to <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Otis</italic> <italic>Elevator</italic>. While <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> syndicated most of <italic>Consolidated</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> debt, they competed with <italic>First Boston</italic> to issue stock.) So, SEC eased SA1933 CP rules with SA1964. \nBy 1965, insurance regulators allowed LICs to hold dividend non-paying stocks and parent HC debt. UST allowed banks to hold leases and TA1962 reduced depreciable lives and added investment tax credits, but investment collapsed when Congress briefly suspended credits. Following states, FPC mandated accelerated PU depreciation in 1966. After SBA trialed small business lease guarantees in 1961, Congress adopted it in 1968. \nLikewise, leasing spread overseas. Between 1960 and 1962, American leasing companies expanded into Europe and the Far East, establishing <italic>Mercantile Leasing</italic> in Britain, <italic>Deutsche Leasing</italic> in Germany, and <italic>Orient Leasing</italic> in Japan. Legislative approval in France in 1966 legitimized leasing transactions previously challenged by the Court of Cassation. Within a year, <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic>, <italic>Barclay</italic>, <italic>Bank of Scotland</italic>, and fifteen other partners, formed <italic>Airlease International</italic> to lease aircraft. By the late 1960s, American leasing companies, in conjunction with their European counterparts, played a pivotal role in expanding leasing activities abroad.\nMergers and hostile takeovers boomed after courts liberalized tax-free spin-offs in 1965. As LICs floated mutual funds, mutual funds sold insurance. Buying shares since 1962, Warren Buffet took <italic>Berkshire </italic>over to buy insurers. So did Maurice Greenberg after taking <italic>American International Group</italic> (\u201cAIG\u201d) public, Tech-focused <italic>Teledyne</italic>, and <italic>Citi NB</italic>, which became a one-bank BHC. <italic>Citi</italic> withdrew as DOJ investigated. Having bought a LIC in the 1920s, <italic>Bank of New York </italic>incorporated in 1968, and absorbed six subsidiaries while buying more banks. Along with <italic>LTV</italic>\u2019s steel purchase, <italic>Lehman</italic> advised insurer and bank sales. While <italic>Pressprich</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Langone took Ross Perot\u2019s EDS public, <italic>Lehman</italic> took Steinberg\u2019s <italic>Leasco</italic> public.\nAll three<italic> Lazard </italic>banks, separately or in unison, were particularly active. Andr\u00e9 Meyer gets credit for innovating retainer fees. As risky credit spurred balance sheet competition, corporate clients paid fees based on the amount of debt and equity capital they raised. With a tiny balance sheet, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York dominated fees for mergers and acquisitions, leveraged buyout (\u201cLBO\u201d), and other complex financial operations.\nAlthough FRS forced her to divest banks in the 1950s, <italic>TransAmerica </italic>became a LIC. After acquiring <italic>United Artists </italic>with <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s advice in 1967, <italic>TransAmerica</italic> LIC bought <italic>Trans International Airlines</italic> and <italic>Budget Rent-a-Car</italic> in 1968. Since the Tisch brothers began acquiring control of one of Long Island\u2019s largest banks, <italic>Franklin</italic> NB, in 1968, they incorporated <italic>Loew</italic> as an HC in 1969, and bought the <italic>Lorillard</italic> tobacco conglomerate with <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s advice. \n<italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Rohatyn advised IT&T to buy <italic>Hartford</italic> insurer in a record LBO, and both <italic>Lazard</italic> London and New York organized <italic>Lockheed</italic>\u2019s trans-Atlantic venture with British <italic>Rolls Royce</italic>. To shield against takeovers and capital gains, insurers bought back shares and made GUD in-kind payments.<italic></italic> \nWhile the Meinertzhagen brothers of <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Cazenove</italic> took <italic>Pearson</italic> public, <italic>Lazard</italic> London initially consultated on <italic>Rolls Royce</italic>\u2019s funding needs and exerted insider influence from 1968. <italic>Lazard</italic> pressured <italic>Rolls Royce</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s management to form an executive committee with the power to make fast decisions in response to urgent issues. <italic>Lazard</italic> also demanded management changes and information access, which they achieved by garnering support from clearing banks and BOE. In September 1970, <italic>Midland</italic> <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> and <italic>Lloyd</italic> banks agreed to lend to <italic>Rolls Royce</italic> in exchange for board seats and disclosures. \nLikewise, since <italic>Lazard</italic> London helped form <italic>Unilever</italic>, <italic>Unilever </italic>retained <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in 1972 for takeovers. By 1977, Rohatyn advised on <italic>Unilever</italic>\u2019s purchase <italic>National Starch</italic>, with selling advice from <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Robert Greenhill. By 1983, <italic>Lazard</italic> London initiated <italic>Unilever</italic>\u2019s acquisition of <italic>Brooke </italic>to bolster global tea market leadership and British foods. Rohatyn also advised <italic>Allied Chemical</italic> and <italic>United Technologies</italic>. \nUntil Charles Gaulle came to power in 1958, Andr\u00e9 Meyer was skeptical about French economic prospects and so about <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 involvement in foreign oil exploration and in the insurance business, which he wanted to sell to IT&T. Under Gaulle, liberalized laws and inflation from Egypt\u2019s closure of the <italic>Suez</italic> <italic>Canal</italic> in the <italic>Panic of 1956</italic> led<italic> Lazard</italic> Paris to co-found<italic> French Petroleum Investment Co </italic>with<italic> Rothschild</italic> Paris in 1957 and lead <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Immobili\u00e8re Fran\u00e7aise de Construction</italic>, COGEFIMO, and other real estate ventures through her pre-WWII <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier Industriel</italic> (\u201cSOVAC\u201d). \nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1966</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris took control of <italic>Immobili\u00e8re </italic>in 1967 and <italic>French Petroleum </italic>split in 1968. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 <italic>Nord</italic> acquired FRANCAREP, SOVAC acquired EURAFREP with co-investment from her allies, <italic>Worms</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Indochine</italic>, BGGE, and <italic>Solvay</italic>. Through EURAFREP, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris invested in <italic>Works of Marseille</italic> PUHC. \nSince Lazard and Weill cousin Claude Alphand\u00e9ry became a Managing Director of <italic>Immobili\u00e8re-Constructions de Paris</italic> in the early 1960s, he was promoted to Chair and CEO in 1972, he also became a Director of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme de Gestion Immobili\u00e8re</italic>. Over this time, he also served as Chair and CEO of <italic>Banque de la Construction et des Travaux</italic> <italic>Publics</italic>. Along with buying one of France\u2019s largest real-estate corporates, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris launched closed-end investment company COCEPI and created LOCATEL, France\u2019s largest television set rental outfit.\nLikewise, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris expanded into the insurance sector by acquiring significant stakes in key companies. In 1967, <italic>Lazard</italic> became the main shareholder of <italic>La France</italic>, which took control of <italic>Equit\u00e9 lard</italic> and <italic>Equit\u00e9 Vie </italic>in 1973. Later that year, <italic>Lazard</italic> purchased <italic>Generali</italic> shares, effectively controlling nearly 12% of its capital through a partnership with <italic>MedioBanca</italic>. <italic>Generali</italic>\u2019s French subsidiary, <italic>La Concorde</italic>, was among the top 20 insurance companies in France with technical links with <italic>La France</italic>.  \nWhile Lazard cousin-in-laws built <italic>Galeries Lafayette</italic> into one of Europe\u2019s five largest department stores, <italic>Galeries</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic>long-time competitor, <italic>Printemps</italic> diversified. Back in the 1950s, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris offered the required funds and managed the risk, securing capital during the <italic>Korean War</italic>. In 1962, <italic>Au Printemps-Nation</italic> was established, followed by the creation of <italic>Uniprintemps</italic> in 1965, a HC controlling 16 companies. <italic>Paribas</italic> acquired a 4.58% stake in <italic>Uniprintemps</italic> and gained representation on her board with <italic>Lazard</italic>.\nAfter <italic>Parisienne</italic> and <italic>Petrofina</italic> director Eduard Cahen-Fuzier\u2014whose father\u2019s first wife, Rodrigues, was a cousin-in-law of the Cerf, Aron, Alphand\u00e9ry, and Lazard family, and a second cousin once removed of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>\u2019s Jacob Pereire\u2014died in 1948, his nephew-in-law married a Christian descendant of Pereire, <italic>Worms</italic>, LaRoche, and Rhon\u00e9. By then, Cahen-Fuzier\u2019s son-in-law Jean Paisy\u2014who descended from a pre-Revolutionary French stockbroker\u2014was part of <italic>Paris Stock Exchange</italic>, assisting the regulatory <italic>Syndicat des Bourses de Paris</italic> in 1946 and Deputy from 1954. Paisy\u2019s sons-in-law Pierre DuPont became Deputy Director of the Ministry of Finance in 1943, and served as Head of Service at the Ministry of Economic Affairs from 1949 to 1954, when he became Director of Economic Coordination and Nationalized Enterprises until 1958. He then served as Government Commissioner at <italic>Indochine</italic> from 1961 to 1967 and at <italic>Worms</italic> from 1972.\nBack in the 1920s, David Weil\u2019s cousin once removed and Gaston Gunzburg Fould Gradis\u2019 brother married siblings of Magdeleine Go\u00fcin\u2014a great granddaughter of rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> founder Ernest Go\u00fcin and Pereire and Fould cousin Anna Rodrigues\u2014who herself married a brother of Jacques Ganay, an aristocratic Haber descendant and a nephew of a Schneider. Ganay\u2019s sister-in-law married Charles-Albert Boissieu. Since Charles-Albert became Deputy Director of <italic>Schneider</italic><italic> </italic>in 1937, his fourth cousin once removed, Michel, married a descendant of Isaac Orchel in 1940. \nFollowing WWII, Boissieu\u2019s third cousin married a daughter of General Charles Gaulle in 1946. Boissieu then became Managing Partner of <italic>Hottinguer</italic> from 1954, Chair and CEO of <italic>Creusot</italic> in 1960, when he became Manager of <italic>Schneider</italic>, and Administrator soon after, and then Chair of <italic>Commercial Bank of Paris</italic>. Michel, meanwhile, became Secretary-General of <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya </italic>from 1955 and then Director at <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris from 1963. While Charles-Albert\u2019s son Antoine banked in Saigon (1948\u201350), Casablanca (1952\u201354), and became a director at <italic>Commercial Bank of Paris </italic>from 1965, Michel\u2019s daughter married a son of Jean-Marc Pelletier, who had power of attorney at <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1954 and rose up at <italic>Suez</italic> after becoming a director in 1966.\nAnother set of <italic>Lazard</italic>-cousin-in-laws, the Goldets, also restructured their businesses. Before WWI, Henri Goldschmidt married an oil refining Halphen Deutsch-Meurthe heiress, and their children adopted the \u201cGoldet\u201d surname. While Nelly married Huguenot bank <italic>Vernes</italic> heir F\u00e9lix Mallet Vernes in 1923, brother Andr\u00e9 married Andr\u00e9 Lazard\u2019s Goldschmidt niece-in-law in 1924 and became VP of <italic>Electrochemistry, Electrometallurgy, & Electric Steelworks Co of Ugine</italic> (\u201cUgine\u201d) in 1949, and brother Roger revived <italic>Pinaud</italic> perfumery and wed Huguenot bank <italic>Andr\u00e9</italic> heiress in 1942. \nWhile the family restored their <italic>Jupiter</italic> oil refinery with <italic>Shell</italic> after WWI, they sold their oil assets to <italic>Shell</italic> and converted <italic>Jupiter</italic> into an asset manager in 1969. As F\u00e9lix Vernes became Censor of <italic>Parisienne</italic> in 1967, Director of <italic>Vernes</italic> in 1970, and involved in other companies, including <italic>Fonci\u00e8re de France</italic> and <italic>Hydro-energy</italic>, the Goldets, along with their in-laws, led <italic>Shell</italic> France and <italic>Ugine</italic>.\nHenri Goldet\u2019s second cousin once removed, James Goldschmidt, born in Paris before WWII to a hotelier, was a descendant of Frankfurt banker Benedict Goldschmidt. In 1967, he purchased <italic>Union de Transport et de Participations</italic>, renaming it <italic>Union des Participations</italic>, and expanded his holdings with the acquisition of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Fonci\u00e9re</italic>. Two months later, he, along with partners from<italic> Union Bank of Los Angeles</italic> and <italic>Central</italic> NB <italic>of Cleveland</italic>, transformed these assets into <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Occidentale</italic> and <italic>Banque Occidentale</italic>. By 1973, he bought an international food trust from the Rothschilds. Throughout the 1970s, Goldschmidt\u2019s bankers included <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Hambro</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Meyer.\nWhen Goldschmidt bought <italic>Union de Transport</italic>, banker Gilberte Lovisi Beaux sold the assets and later became his business advisor. Born in Paris to aristocrats and a cousin-in-law of the Mallets, Gilberte began her banking career at 16 with <italic>Seligman</italic> Paris in 1945. By 1952, she earned a banking diploma and became an officer at <italic>Seligman</italic> and then Director of <italic>Union Financi\u00e8re de Paris. </italic>After directing <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Fonci\u00e8re</italic> until 1970, she led several companies until becoming President of <italic>Banque Occidentale </italic>in 1975. Andr\u00e9 Meyer is said to have referred to Beaux as the best banker in France.\nAs Belgian PUHCs avoided nationalization. It was one of the few countries where Britain\u2019s <italic>Imperial Continental Gas Association</italic> (\u201cICGA\u201d) from 1824 continued operating. With <italic>Lazard\u2019s</italic> Meyer as director since 1929, Dannie Heineman led BGGE in Brussels. After the WWII, Heineman hired Nathaniel Samuels. Chicago-born Samuels practiced law in his hometown before promotion to Army First Lieutenant. He spent his last year of service at America\u2019s embassy in London and joined BGGE by 1946. After Samuels became a BGGE Director in 1949, he joined <italic>Kuhn</italic> in 1955, becoming Managing Partner in 1966. \nSince 1948, Spanish dictator Francisco Franco\u2019s banker Juan March sought to gain control of BGGE\u2019s <italic>Barcelona Traction</italic>. As Meyer convinced <italic>Rockefeller</italic> to protect BGGE from Spanish exportation by hiring <italic>Sullivan</italic> in 1960, while Belgian King Baudouin to Spain's Fabiola Aragon in 1961, litigation continuing for a decade. Meanwhile, Belgium\u2019s central bank held BGGE shares until deciding to sell in the early 1950s. While Meyer hoped to buy the shares, but lost out to <italic>Lambert</italic>. Angry, Meyer ultimately severed his long-standing relationship with Heineman. \nL\u00e9on Lambert also renewed relations with the cousinhood, recruiting his third cousin once removed via the Rothschilds, Jacques Rothschild Thierry. Since his uncle was an executive at <italic>French & Colonial </italic>HC and other banks, Thierry had joined <italic>Nationale</italic> in 1947 and moved to <italic>Union Bank of Switzerland</italic> in Zurich in 1949 before leading <italic>Lambert</italic> Switzerland in 1953. He became Managing Partner of <italic>Lambert</italic> in 1960 and VP in 1966. \nAs <italic>Lambert</italic> bought stakes in Belgian industrial group<italic> </italic><italic>Empain</italic>\u2019s electric assets in 1950 and <italic>Banque Industrielle Belge</italic> in 1961,<italic> </italic><italic>Empain</italic> defensively acquired the Boissieu-run <italic>Schneider</italic> with <italic>Indochine</italic> as financial guarantor and additional investment from<italic> </italic>Michel Bollor\u00e9. An heir of paper factory <italic>Papeteries Bollor\u00e9</italic> and classmate of <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Antoine Bernheim, Bollor\u00e9 had married Monique Goldschmidt Follot\u2014a second cousin once removed of both Henri and James Goldschmdit\u2014during WWII. Along with running <italic>Papeteries</italic>, he gained directorships across <italic>Schneider</italic><italic>, Union Europ\u00e9enne Industrielle</italic>, and other banks.<italic> </italic><italic>Empain</italic> <italic>Schneider</italic> soon took over <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic>.\nLikewise, <italic>Lambert</italic> sold BGGE shares to SG<italic> Belge</italic>, <italic>MedioBanca</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic>. Through Murnane, Meyer banked <italic>Solvay</italic>, which invested alongside the Belgian royal family in SG<italic> Belge</italic> with cross-holdings of <italic>Electrobel</italic>. As Italy nationalized PU and other industry in 1962, <italic>MedioBanca</italic> reorged industrial family groups. After working uneasily with a Sicilian tax lawyer, Michele Sindona in 1964, Cuccia and Meyer fused <italic>Montecatini</italic> and <italic>Edison</italic> Italy into <italic>Montedison</italic>, Italy\u2019s largest chemical and electric complex. \nMeanwhile, American businesses also evolved. Despite long dominating retail, <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Lehman</italic> faced competition. Born in Oklahoma, Presbyterian Samuel Walton was the first child of rural banker Thomas Walton. After graduating <italic>Uni of Missouri</italic>, he worked at a <italic>JC Penney</italic> in Des Moines, and served as Army captain during WWII. Having married the daughter of an Oklahoma banker, he acquired an Arkansas <italic>Ben Franklin</italic> franchise in 1945 with a loan from his father-in-law. \nBy 1962, Walton and his brother possessed sixteen <italic>Ben Franklin</italic> franchises. But when <italic>Ben Franklin</italic> executives in Chicago rejected his proposal to establish larger stores in rural areas with discount prices and narrower profit margins, he commenced the development of <italic>Wal-Mart</italic>. Despite buying a bank in Arkansas and developing a relationship with <italic>Republic Bank</italic> in Dallas, Walton continued needing financing. By 1969, <italic>White Weld</italic> and <italic>Stephens</italic> of Arkansas took <italic>Wal-Mart </italic>public, along with Scottish investors.\nSince <italic>Lehman</italic> took <italic>Leasco</italic> public, IBM introduced a new line and made <italic>Leasco</italic>\u2019s machines obsolete, crashing <italic>Leasco</italic>\u2019s stock price. After <italic>Lehman</italic> and CBWL helped <italic>Leasco </italic>buy <italic>Reliance Insurance</italic> in 1968, Steinberg attempted to takeover <italic>Chemical NB</italic>. However, the attempt drew attention and opposition. <italic>Chemical </italic>successfully resisted the takeover, utilizing various defensive measures and seeking support from <italic>Lehman</italic>, Governor Rockefeller, Congress, DOJ, FRS, and other regulators sought to ban hostile bank takeovers. Instead, DOJ refocused on her attention on IBM, which hired <italic>Cravath</italic> for over a decade of antitrust litigation.\nBut antitrust law could not breach marriage. Since <italic>Ford</italic> and <italic>Firestone</italic> heirs married while in college in 1946, they solidified car and tire production bonds without the need for corporate action. Similarly, as <italic>Pillsbury</italic> of Minneapolis bought <italic>Burger King</italic> in 1967,<italic> </italic>heir Donaldson Pillsbury married Marian Stuart, whose father presided over <italic>Quaker Oats</italic> in Chicago. Since his great-grandfather and grandfather helped establish <italic>Quaker Oats </italic>in 1901, Robert Stuart became President in 1962. Under his leadership, <italic>Quaker Oats </italic>acquired toy maker <italic>Fisher-Price</italic> in 1969, the company\u2019s first significant acquisition outside her core food business.\nIn 1968, BOE and <italic>London Stock Exchange </italic>jointly created the <italic>Panel on Takeovers & Mergers</italic> to represent shareholder interests. BOE\u2019s Governor seconded Ian Fraser to direct the new <italic>Panel</italic>. Not related to the oil Frasers, he was paternal grandson of the Scot Lord of Lovat (also an ancestor of <italic>Jardine Matheson</italic>\u2019s James Matheson), maternal grandson of the Earl of Verulam, and cousin-in-law of <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s William Keswick. \nAfter earning the <italic>Military Cross</italic> in 1945, Fraser joined <italic>Reuters</italic> as a journalist, he scooped Captain Robert Maxwell using his Occupation status to smuggle gold out of Europe. Unable to publish due to Maxwell\u2019s threat of libel in 1956, Fraser left journalism for <italic>Warburg</italic>. By 1958, Fraser married a Spencer, Baring, and Grey descendant, and led takeovers for African <italic>Lonrho</italic>.\nMaxwell was born as Ludvik Hoch in Czechoslovakia. His family lived in one room in the house of Ludvik\u2019s grandfather, who had supplied meat to the Hungarian army before WWI. Ludvik attended rabbinical academies but abandoned religious study in Bratislava. He left Czechoslovakia before WWII, joined Czech forces that reached France, and arrived in Liverpool in 1940 under evacuation arrangements. He served in the British Army, soon marrying a Huguenot and changing his name.\nIn one of the <italic>Panel</italic>\u2019s first deals to come under his scrutiny, Steinberg\u2019s <italic>Leasco</italic>, sought to pull out of buying <italic>Pergamon Press</italic> from Maxwell after accounting irregularities emerged. Despite Maxwell\u2019s threatened rival amidst emotional outbursts, the full <italic>Panel </italic>backed Fraser\u2019s that <italic>Leasco</italic> should be allowed to withdraw. Having solidified the <italic>Panel</italic>\u2019s authority, Fraser tightened other <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> rules to avoid federal oversight. \nSo, Maxwell made <italic>Pergamon</italic> the base of his takeovers. When Maxwell launched a hostile takeover of London\u2019s <italic>News of the World</italic> in 1969, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Stephen Catto guided the sellers to sell to Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch, and became his board member. Among those who refused to lend to Maxwell were <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s John Ashton, whose father descended from cotton brokers and earned a barony and mother was a cousin once removed of <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Brand. \nAshton was heavily involved in integrating <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s purchase of <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic>-<italic>Martin</italic> as the Government opposed a merger involving <italic>Barclay</italic> and <italic>Lloyd</italic>. The impetus had come from the mergers of Clore and other <italic>secondaries</italic> and the fusion of <italic>Westminster Bank</italic> and <italic>National Provincial Bank </italic>into <italic>National Westminster Bank</italic> (\u201c<italic>NatWest</italic>\u201d) in 1968, which cartelized credit with other clearing banks with less BOE control. Since <italic>McKinsey</italic> implemented a multidivisional structure for <italic>Citi</italic> in 1967,<italic>NatWest</italic>,<italic> Grindlay</italic>, and<italic> Midland</italic> sought <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s advice to adopt the multidivisional structure, while <italic>Barclay </italic>retained <italic>Urwick Orr</italic>.\nBut as the <italic>Vietnam War</italic> escalated, the Soviets aided Egypt to invade Israel in 1967. When Egypt closed the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> and embargoed oil, TRC raised production limits (unlike in 1957). With coal and oil substitution, coal-heavy TVA hiked rates for the first time and led PUs to invest in nuclear energy. Amidst PU union strikes, FPC hesitated rate hikes. As PA1935 forbade vertical integrated cost passthroughs, PU profits squeezed relative to FPC\u2019s quantity-capped fuels. \nAfter the Court allowed <italic>PENN</italic> to buy <italic>Central</italic>, ICC lobbied Congress to amend BA1938 for <italic>PENN</italic> to monetize NOCs. While advisory-focused <italic>Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> had low overhead, <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Lehman</italic> grew large and shifted CP from trade to industry since SA1964. To pay dividends and retain NYSE access, ICC allowed<italic> PENN</italic> to issue CP using <italic>Goldman</italic> in 1968 (with the only CP ratings agency giving her highest rating.) As <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s client, <italic>Mill Factors</italic>, defaulted on CP by yearend, holders sued <italic>Goldman</italic>.\nSince France abolished FA1933-like deposit-merchant bank division by 1966, the French Rothschilds reorganized and modernized their far-flung interests, including the bank, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, under a new HC, <italic>Co du Nord</italic>, to branch into Italy and elsewhere in early 1967. <italic>Nord</italic> holdings included French railroads, <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>, <italic>Nickel</italic>, oil, insurance, rail equipment and shipbuilding. \nHaving leased <italic>Royal Mint Refinery</italic> since 1852, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London sold the lease to <italic>Engelhard</italic> in 1967, which, along with <italic>Johnson</italic>, monopolized British precious metal refining. Late that year, <italic>MINERAL</italic> and <italic>Engelhard</italic> merged, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York sold her shares to the Engelhard family. As <italic>Lehman</italic> banker Philip Isles\u2014a Lehman heir whose father converted and changed his Ickelheimer name\u2014married a daughter of Cornelia Rensselaer Thayer and German aristocrat Count Moltke, his sister married <italic>Engelhard</italic> employee John Barney, of unknown relation to other Barneys.\nMeanwhile, American labor strikes continued growing. Teacher walkouts spiked with 33 in 1966 alone. Public employee strikes grew in 1967, and in the following year, Florida educators held a state-wide stoppage. Unions also spread across party lines, as blue-collar workers from Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan supported George Wallace\u2019s racist campaigns in 1964 and 1968. While Wallace lost, entrenched union laborers parlayed their profits into local elections to protect their interests. In one case in 1973, Illinois set up roadblocks to enforce certification and protect overpaid drivers from mostly Black entrepreneurs. \nAfter studying sociology at <italic>Tufts Uni</italic>, Irish-Catholic Daniel Patrick Moynihan worked in Robert Wagner\u2019s mayoral campaign in 1953, wrote speeches for Averell Harriman\u2019s 1954 gubernatorial campaign, after which he became Harriman\u2019s chief aide. In 1961, he joined the Kennedy Labor Department and remained when Lyndon Johnson took over. As President Johnson declared war on poverty in 1964, Moynihan authored a report on Black families in 1965.\nShocked that increasingly (mostly Black) single mothers used<italic> Social Security</italic> grants from 1935 meant for widows, Moynihan blamed slavery and racism for growing out-of-wedlock births among Blacks, arguing that equality required federal intervention. While his report faced criticism from both liberal and conservative quarters, President Johnson soon adopted it. \nAfter naming Andrew Brimmer the first Black Governor of FRS\u2019 Board in 1966, Johnson appointed Thurgood Marshall as the first Black Court Justice in 1967. Likewise, Congress outlawed racial discrimination in housing with the <italic>Civil Rights Act of 1968</italic>, chartered the <italic>Housing & Urban Development Act </italic>(\u201cHUD\u201d), and to cap off his <italic>Great Society</italic> initiative in a war on poverty, expanded <italic>Social Security</italic> grants to single mothers.\nIn late 1968, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York hired CR Smith, Frederick Deming, and Peter Lewis as partners. CR Smith, former Chair and CEO of <italic>American Airlines</italic>, was Secretary of Commerce since the spring. Frederick Deming left his position as Under Secretary of UST, which he has held since 1965. Deming previously President of FRS <italic>Minneapolis</italic>. Peter Lewis worked at <italic>Lazard</italic> from 1958 before serving as HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary from 1965 and OMB Assistant Director from 1968. \nReal estate developer <italic>Trump</italic> also benefited from the legislation. Following in the footsteps of his father, Fred Trump completed the <italic>Trump Village</italic> low-income apartment complex in Brooklyn in 1965. By 1968, his son Donald graduated from <italic>Wharton</italic> and joined the family business.\nAmidst the crisis, protest of the <italic>Vietnam War</italic> turned violent at the <italic>Democratic National Convention</italic> in 1968. As <italic>Sullivan</italic>\u2019s Dean counselled Johnson not to seek reelection, <italic>Akin Gump</italic>\u2019s Strauss stepped in as supporters deserted. Hubert Humphrey gained the Democratic nomination\u2014and funding from <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Weinberg, but lost to Richard Nixon. During the winter and spring of 1968, activists in Memphis sustained the union\u2019s momentum among garbage men, uniting their labor rights with the civil rights movement and drawing Reverend Martin King Jr, the son of an influential Baptist minister, who urged Memphis Blacks to deposit their money in <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> and other Black-owned banks before being assassinated. That year, work stoppages reached a 15-year high.\nSince FRS delayed tightening monetary policy until TA1968 raised taxes to fund the <italic>Vietnam War</italic> and <italic>Great Society</italic>. While imposing <italic>Reg Q</italic> caps on large CDs, FRS increased the discount rate. As one-bank BHCs issued CP, banks with foreign branches tapped MMEU, or utilized security repos. FRS required repo and MMEU reserves but could not stem BHC CP. But as soaring MMFR rates sparked a recession, Congress allowed S&Ls and foreign banks to lend in MMFR.\nAs the <italic>London Gold Pool</italic> inflated convertible currencies, France withdrew from the pool and took possession of over half a billion dollars in gold from America. While other countries sought to emulate France, President Johnson assigned former UST Secretary Dillon and Andr\u00e9 Meyer to move away from only using gold to back currencies to <italic>Special Drawing Rights</italic> (\u201cSDRs\u201d), which allow central banks to back currencies with a basket of currencies administered by IMF. \nAs trade balance deteriorated, Britain devalued her <italic>pound</italic> in, UST extended and mandated 1965\u2019s voluntary domestic capital controls in 1968 to protect <italic>dollars</italic>. But the controls boosted MMEU instead. By March, four major banks\u2014British <italic>Midland Bank</italic>, German <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, Belgian SG <italic>Belge</italic>, and Dutch AMRO\u2014established <italic>European-American Bank & Trust</italic> in New York City to facilitate transatlantic investments. <italic>Loeb</italic> hired a SG <italic>Belge</italic> heir soon after to lead her new Brussels branch.\nLikewise, UST eliminated FRS\u2019 gold reserve ratio to protect the dollar. As investors ran to the $35 per ounce gold, the <italic>Pool</italic> lost 400 tons. Per UST and FRS, Johnson asked BOE to suspend the <italic>London Gold Pool</italic>. While central banks adopted SDRs, a Swiss bank cartel replaced London as the gold trade center. \n<italic>Rothschild</italic> London continued to lead the gold fixing in London with prices in <italic>dollars</italic>. While authorized JMB to deal FX, BOE oversaw<italic> Midland</italic><italic> Bank</italic>\u2019s purchase of <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> by September 1968. In November, however, BOE devalued her <italic>pound</italic> to stem broker losses on gold. To bolster BOE lifer O\u2019Brien relationship with merchant banks, PM Wilson added <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> Chair Gordon Richardson as a non-executive director. Within months, Bruno Schr\u00f6der kinterlinked with <italic>Cazenove</italic> and so, through the Meinertzhagen family, <italic>Lazard</italic> London.\nWith the emergence of a free gold market, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> bought <italic>Valcambi</italic> refinery in Ticino to become a major gold trading house from 1968. Likewise, <italic>Citi</italic> sold her British <italic>Samuel</italic> shares 1963 from and, alongside <italic>Lloyd </italic>Bank, acquired a large stake <italic>Grindlay </italic>in 1968, which bought fifty-one Anglo-French colonial <italic>TURK</italic> branches across the Middle East and North Africa. While <italic>Engelhard</italic>\u2019s Swiss-based global <italic>Philipp</italic> division remained dominant, Engelhard inspired Ian Fleming\u2019s Auric Goldfinger character. UAE\u2019s Dubai imported half of the entire free world production of gold for that year. \nBut Engelhard faced competition. Before Earl of Airlie David Ogilvy\u2019s brother, Angus, married Princess Alexandra in 1963, he hired Roland Rowland to manage <italic>Lonrho</italic> his modest Rhodesian ranching company by buying Rowland\u2019s company in a stock-for-stock swap in 1961. Working with <italic>Warburg</italic> London\u2019s Ian Fraser, Rowland expanded <italic>Lonrho</italic>\u2019s reach through takeovers of various businesses across Africa, including newspapers, breweries, mills, automobile franchises, plantations, and construction firms. In 1968, <italic>Lonrho</italic> bought Ghana\u2019s<italic> Ashanti</italic> <italic>Goldfields</italic> in a stock-for-stock swap, solidifying the company\u2019s position in finance. \nFrom 1969 until Engelhard\u2019s death in 1971, the Engelhard family sold <italic>MINERAL</italic> shares to <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>. But <italic>Philipp</italic> oil<italic> </italic>drove profits since <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>\u2019s Oppenheimer did not actively manage to produce the synergies Meyer envisioned. Since American-born Ferdinand Eberstadt partnered with Meyer for <italic>MINERAL</italic> in 1952, he died in 1969. So Meyer hired his cousin Walter Eberstadt. \nBorn in 1921, Walter fled Germany for Britain in before serving in the Infantry during WWII and getting wounded in Normandy. Afterward, he immigrated to America in 1951, he soon joined <italic>Lehman</italic> and worked with fellow refugee, Leo Model, as a financier for <italic>Model Roland</italic> over 17 years. While Walter married a Katz-descendant of the Brodsky and Dreyfu\u00df families in 1964 and innovated closed-end mutual funds, Model served as a director with <italic>Dreyfu</italic><italic>\u00df</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>. After <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic> invested in <italic>Model Roland</italic><italic> </italic>in 1969, Walter joined <italic>Lazard</italic> New York and was responsible for institutional foreign business by 1972. \nCommodity traders like <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic>, <italic>Cargill</italic>, <italic>Continental Grain</italic>, and <italic>Tate Lyle</italic>, controlled a significant portion of international trade during the commodity boom of 1970s. <italic>Philipp</italic> alone traded over 150 different commodities. While <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>loyalists remained on <italic>MINERAL</italic>.\u2019s board, the generations shifted. Since <italic>Lazard </italic>New York\u2019s Catholic George Murnane hired his son, George Jr, in 1951, the latter wed Thomas Murray McDonnell\u2019s sister and made partner in 1958, and then headed the bond department from 1965 to 1970. \nAfter the elder Murnane died in 1969, his son retired from <italic>Lazard</italic> in 1972, while remaining a director on the boards of <italic>MINERAL</italic>, <italic>Trinova Corp</italic>, the former <italic>Libby-Owens-Ford Glass Corp</italic>, and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s American operations, <italic>Swiss American Corp</italic>. The Murnanes worked closely with Rainer Gut. Born in Switzerland to a Catholic <italic>Zuger Kantonalbank</italic> executive, Gut became a general partner at <italic>Lazard</italic> New York from 1968 until transitioning to Chair and CEO of <italic>Swiss American Corp</italic> in New York in 1971. More lastingly, Andr\u00e9 Meyer\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Felix Rohatyn joined <italic>MINERAL</italic>\u2019s board to invest in America. \nAfter Ogilvy\u2019s<italic> Lonrho</italic> bought Ghana\u2019s <italic>Ashanti Goldfields</italic> in 1968, Rowland\u2019s direct dealings with African government officials and bypassing London officials made him enemies, leading several countries to impose currency restrictions. While Rowland secured a British Court injunction and support from shareholders. By 1972, Ghana\u2019s negotiations with <italic>Lonrho</italic> financially benefited the government but failed to break the corporation\u2019s control. While Angus Ogilvy distanced himself from Rowland and <italic>Lonrho </italic>to focus on philanthropy, he faced accusations that were later cleared.\nSince Britain\u2019s Africa-focused <italic>Standard</italic> acquired <italic>Bank of British West Africa</italic> in 1965, HSBC\u2019s great rival East Asia-focused <italic>Chartered Bank</italic> broke her Africa-sharing contract with <italic>Chase, </italic>merging with <italic>Standard</italic> in 1969, and gold broker <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic> from <italic>Hambro</italic> in May 1973. \nAmidst the slew of international financial banks, <italic>Asian Development Bank</italic> started in 1966. But as Hong Kong refused to reduce withholding taxes, so <italic>Bank of America, Chase,</italic> and <italic>Narodny</italic> ran to Singapore when she lowered taxes in 1968 and the Muslim Religious Council absorbed waqf (charitable Islamic trusts) decision-making powers. Hong Kong invested in MMEA to bank East Asia. \nWhile DOJ refocused antitrust to small firm acquisitions from 1968, Congress dissuaded rushed hostile takeovers with the <italic>Williams Act</italic>. Hostiles waned, but mergers and spin-offs soared. FRS further tightened credit in mid-1969 and SEC required conglomerates to register spin-offs as securities, DOJ sued to stop her 1968 purchase of the nation\u2019s 6th largest steel firm, <italic>LTV</italic>\u2019s counsel, <italic>Arnold Porter</italic>\u2014whose partner Fortas had joined the Court in 1965\u2014obtained a court order permitting <italic>LTV</italic> to buy and hold the firm until the antitrust case is resolved. <italic>LTV</italic> eventually settled the case by selling off two companies. \nThe IT&T-<italic>Hartford</italic> deal was almost finalized when IRS ordered a share sale for tax-free completion. To comply, Andr\u00e9 Meyer sold <italic>Hartford</italic> shares to <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s associates <italic>MedioBanca</italic> and <italic>Fiat</italic>\u2019s Agnelli. While the sale satisfied IRS was, DOJ investigated the antitrust aspects of the deal, and Congress probed <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s </italic>role in conglomerate mergers. Connecticut\u2019s insurance commissioner also intervened. Meyer suggested adding a well-connected Protestant to IT&T\u2019s board, but IT&T\u2019s new Jewish CEO chose to add Rohatyn instead.\nMeanwhile Middle Eastern nationalizations and coups continued. Although the Iran-Iraq relationship was strained by 1966, defeat in the <italic>Six Day War</italic> of 1967 led Saddam Hussein\u2019s <italic>Baath Party</italic> to seize control in Iraq in 1968 and expel thousands of Iranian Shia. By April 1969, Iran abrogated her treaty with Iraq regarding the shared Shatt Arab River. Amidst the conflict, Minos Zombanakis formed <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic> London with minority investment from <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and organized a $80 million syndicated loan to Iran, establishing the use of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLibor\u201d) for MMEU transactions.\nThe <italic>Six Day War</italic> loss also grew Nasserist sentiment in Libya, spurring violence against Jews until the government proclaimed a state of emergency and curfew. By September 1969, Muammar Qaddafi overthrew King Idris in a military coup. Despite concerns of oil nationalization, <italic>Occidental</italic> beat out rival Bunker Hunt in negotiating a new agreement in 1970. Since Syrian military purges of 1966 left the country ill-prepared for war, public discontent with <italic>Baath</italic> grew. As Jadid\u2019s faction opposed compromise with Israel, rejecting UN Resolution 242 and disapproved of American peace initiatives, Assad consolidated power and sidelined Jadid as he centralized government by 1970. \nLikewise, Bolivian General Candia nationalized <italic>Gulf Oil</italic>\u2019s holdings, offering compensation from the future profits of the nationalized firm in 1969. As Chile elected Marxist Salvador Allende as President, <italic>Caribbean Development Bank</italic> (\u201cCDB\u201d) started in 1970 to diversify industry, and IT&T funded CIA to create chaos and a coup to block Allende from coming to power. \nAs IT&T negotiated with the Nixon Administration, Rohatyn warned DOJ that the loss of access to <italic>Hartford</italic>\u2019s float would bankrupt IT&T. Consequently, DOJ allowed the merger but ordered the divestment of other assets. As IT&T\u2019s political wrangling became public, Congress opted to investigate after the 1972 Presidential election. CIA\u2019s Director from 1966 to 1973, Richard Helms was the grandson of Gates McGarrah, who built <italic>Chase</italic> NB into a German financier in the 1920s and then became President of <italic>Bank for International Settlements</italic> (\u201cBIS\u201d) in 1930, working closely with <italic>Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Andr\u00e9 Meyer, and other bankers.\nAs costs squeezed small brokers, <italic>Burnham</italic> acquired Philadelphia brokerage <italic>Gerstle Sunstein</italic>. Still, NYSE was only 11% off its peak but collapsed as FRS required banks to hold repo reserves. Congress restored presidential authority to control speculative credit and with  limited GUD to stock redemption gains and M&A tax-deduction to equity. TA1969 accelerated depreciation to promote leases but eliminated investment tax credits (squeezing capital spending) and spurred divestment with NOC incentives. Although the <italic>Accounting Principles Board </italic>(\u201cAPB\u201d) limited hybrid securities\u2019 earnings benefits, firms paid lower taxes. Divestments replaced acquisitions as SEC forced APB to revise terms.\nMeanwhile, labor strike continued. After a coalition of unions protested GE in 1969, autoworkers struck against <italic>General </italic><italic>Motor</italic> in 1970. And as federal postal workers struck that year, construction workers clashed with antiwar demonstrators. So, Nixon\u2019s Republican Administration extended affordable housing and minority rights.\nFor the former, TA1969 accelerated real estate depreciation for residential renting with extra benefits for low-income housing projects. As TA1969 increased capital gains taxes, <italic>Lazard</italic> and other securities firms syndicated housing investments tax shelters. Reversing TA1942, TA1969 changed banks\u2019 debt gains from capital gains to ordinary income. Although banks could still structure as one-bank BHCs free from <italic>Reg Q</italic>, they organized REITs to participate in real estate construction and development (\u201cC&D\u201d) through equity-like capital gains rather than higher-taxed debt. By 1970, <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Lehman </italic>underwrote <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s REIT. While <italic>Pressprich</italic>\u2019s Langone took a firm public in February, shorts soon overtook the market.\nAlong with expanded housing, President Nixon aided minorities. In 1970, created the <italic>Office of Minority Business Enterprises</italic> within the <italic>Commerce Department</italic> through an executive order. As part of this effort, <italic>Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Corps</italic> (\u201cMESBICs\u201d) were established to encourage corporations and banks to support minority-owned businesses. Private companies and foundations were encouraged to create pools of capital, which SBA would multiply by investing or lending $3 for every $1 that the MESBIC put into the deal. By June 30, 1970, 100 corporations and foundations signed up to participate. \nAfter working for two years at <italic>Paul Weiss</italic>, Reginald Lewis started his own law firm to specialize in MESBIC. Serving the growing business needs of the city\u2019s Black community, Lewis became the outside general counsel for <italic>American MESBIC</italic> <italic>Association </italic>soon after. As the Black-owned inter-state <italic>Supreme</italic> LIC recorded a large loss in 1970, majority stockholder John Johnson replaced Earl Dickerson in 1971. As Johnson\u2019s diversified into entertainment, <italic>Supreme</italic> remained the oldest Black LIC, but outrun by other Black LICs.  \nBy 1968, <italic>PENN</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Central</italic> railroads merged. Since the divorce of <italic>PENN</italic> heiress Mary Roberts Clark and Governor Nelson Rockefeller in 1962, Mary\u2019s cousin, Secretary of <italic>PENN</italic> Bayard Roberts, participated in the merger with <italic>Central</italic>, and his daughter married a son of <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s David Rockefeller. Likewise, <italic>PENN</italic><italic> Central</italic> was led by a <italic>Chase</italic> director and her board included a <italic>Morgan</italic> director, her board added the President of <italic>Campbell Soup</italic>\u2014also a <italic>Morgan</italic> director\u2014, the Chair of <italic>Marine Midland</italic>, <italic>COALH</italic>\u2019s President, and <italic>Cabot</italic> petrochemical\u2019s Louis Cabot by 1969. \nWhile TA1969 aided coal roads with leases and limited oil depreciation, SEC curbed accounting acquisitions. Congress did not amend BA1938<italic> </italic>for <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic>, but followed up 1969 coal health and safety inspection laws by regulating high-sulfur Eastern coal with CA1970. By 1969, <italic>AMAX</italic> began mining Western coal. With low-sulfur coal exports continuing to grow, PUs ran from Eastern coal.\nWithout UST or FRS aid, <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central </italic>defaulted on CP. (Having advised on management before, <italic>Lazard</italic> led <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic>\u2019s bankruptcy with <italic>Kuhn</italic>.) With CP collapsing, FRS suspended <italic>Reg Q</italic> ceilings on short-maturity large CDs and encouraged banks to discount CP. <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic>\u2019s bankruptcy hounded <italic>Goldman</italic> for years, made worse by Sidney Weinberg\u2019s death months earlier, and the ascension of relatively unconnected Gustave Levy as Senior Partner. (Still, Sidney Weinberg\u2019s son and other relatives inherited his clients and other roles at <italic>Goldman</italic>.) \nAs investors ran from <italic>Chrysler</italic>\u2019s stock and CP, lead banker, <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic> NB extended a bank loan to avoid default. But the crisis squeezed Northeast PU-creditors. While PA1935 limited PUHC bond issuance. While FPC trapped gas in the Southwest, they exempted small producers in 1971. Amidst coal shortages, TVA urged FTC to investigate cartels. Congress\u2019 commission later blamed chaotic inter-state bankruptcy preferences, difficult involuntary filing, and divided charges for the consumer, business, and railroad crises. Congress did little to alter these. So, while states subsidized <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic> roads from 1971, bankruptcies grew. \nHaving linked most stock exchanges to the <italic>third market</italic>, <italic>Jefferies</italic> joined NYSE in 1967. As <italic>third market</italic> trading volume soared 40% that year and <italic>Jefferies</italic> become the seventh-largest NYSE firm, members of NYSE campaigned to ban <italic>Jefferies</italic> for disrupting fair competition and fragmenting the market. In 1969, former FRS Chair Martin led a study and recommended eliminating the <italic>third market</italic>. At the same time, <italic>Jefferies</italic> sold an interest to <italic>Investors Diversified Services</italic> (\u201cIDS\u201d) to bypass NYSE restrictions and expand her institutional business. Because IDS didn\u2019t make at least 50% of its income from broker-dealer operations, <italic>Jefferies</italic> had to leave the NYSE under Exchange Rule 318, allowing her to trade in the <italic>third market</italic> unconstrained by NYSE.\nAccelerating stock trading and minimum commissions multiplied profits, spurring new brokers. But as clearing squeezed brokers that had not invested in computers, NYSE centralized clearing in 1968. As trades and inventory deflated, NYSE\u2019s central clearing worsened runs from brokers with junior priority until Congress amended \u00a760(e). \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>, Rohatyn joined NYSE\u2019s <italic>Crisis Committee</italic>. By the Spring, <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>, which had grown national offices from 9 to 82 between 1959 and 1970, faced capital withdrawals and operational failures. With messy back-office systems were a mess, and retiring partners withdrawing capital exacerbated losses, risking a loan default from Oklahoma clients and inability to account for $7 million in securities. Leading efforts to find a buyer, Rohatyn approached CBWL\u2019s Sandy Weill due to his firm\u2019s clearing capabilities. CBWL acquired <italic>Hayden Stone</italic>\u2019s assets and name with Frank Zarb\u2019s back-office expertise while NYSE contributed $7.6 million and assumed $10 million in liabilities. Likewise, broker <italic>DuPont</italic><italic> </italic>bought <italic>Forgan</italic> and <italic>Hirsch</italic>  \nAfter a large loss in 1969, Thomas Murray McDonnell could no longer turn to his former brother-in-law Ford since the divorce and sought a loan from his cousin at <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic>. Despite closing 23 out of 26 offices, <italic>McDonnell</italic> shuttered as the loan failed to materialize. Although SEC barred him from brokering, <italic>Allen</italic> hired McDonnell for foreign business. As more brokers failed, NYSE elected Rohatyn to her board. As NYSE and Ross Perot<italic> </italic>bought <italic>DuPont</italic><italic> </italic>brokerage<italic> </italic>six months after her shot-gun acquisitions, <italic>Merrill</italic> acquired <italic>Goodbody</italic>, the fifth largest broker. But as NYSE refused to extend loans to several brokers, creditors filed the first involuntary broker bankruptcy since the 1930s. \nSo, Congress federalized NYSE\u2019s <italic>Fund</italic> with FDIC-like broker insurance and liquidation (\u201cSIPA\u201d), except for brokers that deal exclusively in mutual funds or municipal or UST securities. At the last minute, Congress ended private broker cartels by floating commissions and relaxing NYSE\u2019s incorporation ban. So, securities partnerships and closely held private corporations went public in waves (often saving taxes). \nHaving lobbied to overturn NYSE\u2019s old rule preventing securities firms from going public, <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic>, <italic>Merrill</italic>, <italic>Reynolds</italic>, and <italic>Bache</italic> became the first securities firms to IPO in between 1970 and 1971, raising permanent capital for national and product diversification, and ending the longstanding family partnership model that limited risk taking. Still, NYSE convinced SEC to allow fixed stock block trade commissions. \nThe same day, Congress tightened the <italic>Williams Act</italic>, and equalized BHC regulation with  to separate <italic>commerce</italic> and <italic>finance</italic>. One BHC received an exception. Due to historical factors and Massachusetts trust law,<italic> Boston Co</italic> and her <italic>Boston Safe Deposit & Trust </italic>subsidiary, America\u2019s largest nonbank. Still, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> organized as a BHC and spread across New England. Following BHCA1970, FRS allowed BHCs to lease real and personal property starting in 1971, with provisions for automobile leasing introduced in 1974.  resumed the investment trade credit TA1969 repealed, made leases tradable, accelerated depreciation. \nSo, Steinberg formed <italic>Reliance</italic> as an insurance HC under <italic>Leasco</italic> in 1971 later rebranding as <italic>Reliance</italic>. As <italic>Morgan </italic>sought to sponsor a leveraged net lease REIT, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Disque Deane established <italic>Corporate Property Investors</italic> (\u201cCPI\u201d). <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> real estate arm, <italic>Peerage Properties</italic>, which held<italic> Roosevelt Field </italic>and other leases, advised CPI\u2019s investments, and developed middle-income housing. \nWhile CPI <italic>Lazard</italic> partners sheltered income through real estate transactions, other investors included the Agnelli family of Italy, <italic>Ford Foundation</italic>, and the pensions of GE and <italic>STEEL</italic>. Before reaching thirty thousand subsidized apartments Andr\u00e9 Meyer and Deane developed the <italic>Starrett City</italic> housing complex in Brooklyn along with <italic>Trump</italic> by 1972. \nTA1971 also eliminated pollution upgrade tax-exempt debt caps. As <italic>dollars</italic> inflated, G10 agreed to stop BIS and Western central banks from investing FX in MMEU in the Spring of 1971. But when FRS eased rates to avoid recession, Nixon floated the <italic>dollar</italic> from gold. As his <italic>Federal Energy Administration</italic> (\u201cFEA\u201d) controlled oil, drilling slowed. Instead, 1959\u2019s oil quota grew imports. \nAfter the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> <italic>Crisis</italic> Western oil companies developed Libyan oil. Hammer\u2019s <italic>Occidental</italic> negotiated with Libya\u2019s King Idris in the 1960s and early 1970s to secure control over the country\u2019s natural resources. In 1966, <italic>Occidental </italic>discovered a billion-barrel oilfield in Libya and became one of the largest petroleum companies in the world. The Revolutionary Command Council replaced Idris in 1969, soon headed by Muammar Qaddafi. Hammer beat out rival Bunker Hunt by negotiating a new agreement by 1971. \nWhile European and American firms developed Libyan oil after the <italic>Suez Canal Crisis</italic> and <italic>Sinai War </italic>of 1956, they switched to Nigeria after Libyan boycott during the <italic>Six Day War</italic> of 1967. Having become wealthy by brokering oil leases for Black landowners in Oklahoma and Texas, slave descendant Jake Simmons increasingly did so for Africa. By 1972, another bad Soviet harvest led <italic>Narodny</italic> London to buy record grain with gold via MMEU, with plans to open a Canadian branch. \nSince Congress confirmed the first Black Court justice in 1967, women\u2019s advocacy groups pushed for female candidates. Unsuccessful under Johnson, the <italic>National Women</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Political Caucus</italic> compiled a list of qualified female candidates for Nixon to consider as potential Court justices. However, Nixon\u2019s nominees were deemed unqualified. \nAlthough American only had White female Treasurers since 1949, Nixon appointed Romana Ba\u00f1uelos as the first non-White woman to hold a high government post in 1971. As a child, she was deported from America to Mexico in the 1930s, but returned as an 18-year-old single mother, and founded a food company that eventually became a large enterprise. She later established California\u2019s first Hispanic-owned bank. \nThat same year, Governor Rockefeller appointed Carmel Marr to lead New York\u2019s PU regulator. The first Black and first woman to do so, Marr immigrated from Barbados and advised the American mission at the <italic>United Nations</italic> since 1953. However, <italic>Sullivan </italic>hired only two female associates, bringing their total to four, which was the same number that John Dulles had hired in 1930. \nFollowing a three-year sexual discrimination lawsuit, <italic>Sullivan</italic> agreed to submit recruitment records to New York City\u2019s <italic>Commission on Human Rights</italic>. While <italic>Davis Polk</italic> named her first female partner\u2014an observant Jew and the mother of four\u2014in 1971 and developed a liberal policy on maternity leave with part-time work during early childhood, <italic>Paul Hastings </italic>hired their first woman by 1973, New Mexico-born Patricia Diaz, a UCLA and <italic>Loyola Uni</italic> Law graduate, who represented <italic>Pacific Lighting</italic> and ABC management in labor disputes.\nIn June 1972, SEC charged IT&T, <italic>MedioBanca</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic> for not registering the <italic>Hartford</italic> shares \u2018sold\u2019 to <italic>MedioBanca</italic> per SA1933. While they settled out of court, shareholder lawsuits continued, including concerns regarding possible tax consequences for investors exchanging <italic>Hartford</italic> shares for IT&T shares. Despite SEC staff recommending a fraud charge against IT&T and <italic>Lazard</italic>, SEC commissioner William Casey intervened and overturned the recommendation after receiving a call from Senator Edward Kennedy on behalf of his family. Ultimately, both IT&T and <italic>Lazard</italic> were exonerated.\nAs NASD used Madoff\u2019s BLMIS technology for OTC corporate market making in 1971, NASDAQ attracted the profitable orders. (OTC stocks also boomed as insurance regulators allowed LICs to hold them.) After expanding operations to Texas in 1971,<italic> Jefferies</italic> filing an antitrust lawsuit against NYSE for Exchange Rule 318 arguing that exclusion amounted to an illegal monopoly. In 1973, the presiding judge decided to rule in <italic>Jefferies</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> favor, allowing brokerage firms owned by different types of companies to join NYSE as long as 80% of their business was with the public. As Jefferies reentered NYSE, Boyd Jefferies repurchased his firm from IDS.\nAfter selling a minority interest to a British firm in 1960, <italic>Harriman Ripley </italic>merged with <italic>Drexel</italic> in 1965. After the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>, George Baker III\u2014whose father George Baker II had sold <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> to <italic>Citi</italic> and whose mother was <italic>Drexel</italic> heiress Frances Paul Munn married a grandniece of Anthony Drexel Biddle in 1971. While <italic>Drexel Harriman Ripley</italic> raised cash from her client <italic>Firestone</italic>, she continued ailing despite her \u2018white shoe\u2019 image. And despite venturing into investment banking, Sanford Weill\u2019s old employer<italic> Burnham</italic> was still lacking the clout to underwrite stocks and bonds independently. So, the \u2018sub-major\u2019 <italic>Burnham</italic> merged with the \u2018major\u2019 <italic>Drexel Firestone</italic> to create <italic>Drexel Burnham</italic> in 1973. \nSince the brokerage of <italic>OIL</italic> heir and Kennedy-in-law Hugh Auchincloss merged with <italic>Thomson McKinnon </italic>in 1970, the entity fused <italic>Halle Stieglitz</italic><italic> </italic>in June 1973, and, a month later, with <italic>Kohlmeyer</italic> of the South and Southeast.Also that year <italic>Bache</italic> bought <italic>Stuart</italic> and <italic>White Weld</italic> bought <italic>Walker</italic> soon after as brokers and NYSE continued deflating, leading Kenneth Langone to leave <italic>Pressprich</italic> to invest on his own in 1974, soon founding <italic>Home Depot</italic>. Likewise, <italic>CBWL-Hayden Stone</italic>\u2019s Sanford Weill made his largest acquisition, <italic>Shearson</italic>, to become <italic>Shearson Hayden</italic>. \nSince Tisch transformed <italic>Loew</italic> into an HC and acquired <italic>Franklin</italic> NB in 1969, they bought the large insurer <italic>CNA</italic> in 1974. Similarly, after going public and becoming an HC, <italic>Merrill </italic>bought <italic>Brown Shipley</italic> of London and a LIC in Seattle. To guarantee trades without correspondent brokers, <italic>Merrill </italic>lobbied for a national market. So, trading accelerated at SA1975 ended broker commissions. BLMIS built the automation of the first computerized exchange and dominated OTC corporate market making. With SA1975 removing fixed commission rates, the allure of the <italic>third market</italic> grew for institutions, and <italic>Jefferies</italic>\u2019 operations. Starting with back-office, computers reshaped financial services labor operations and structure. \nSince the Court ordered <italic>Morgan</italic>-AT&T to divest <italic>Western Union </italic>in 1914, financial control shifted among <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Harriman Ripley</italic>, and <italic>Rockefeller</italic>. After cutting jobs from 38,000 to 26,500 between 1955 and 1965, <italic>Western Union</italic> created the new \u2018mailgram\u2019 service in 1970 and centralized call centers for incoming telegrams in 1971. As employees refused the cost savings, they struck for 104-days. Telegraph revenues never recovered. In 1972, as <italic>Western Union</italic> laid off more unionized employees, the severance offered nearly matched the 1973 profit. \nIn February 1973, <italic>Kuhn</italic> sought to issue debt for <italic>Western Union</italic>. But as the transaction failed, <italic>Kuhn</italic> realized her first negative annual profit since the 1930s. After seeking approval from <italic>Federal Communications Commission</italic> (\u201cFCC\u201d) to double per-word rates and increase rates for every 100-word mailgram in April, <italic>Western Union</italic> offered cash to unconvertible bondholders and fewer nonconvertible bonds at higher interest rates in June. By August, <italic>Western Union</italic> agreed to union demands to increase wages and benefits by over 5% annually until 1975, along with additional cost-of-living provisions. After <italic>Western Union</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> employee count fell to 13,000 in 1976, pensioners exceeded employees by 1981. \nAlso in 1972, the Court\u2019s decision expanded FTC\u2019s authority, allowing consideration of broader public values in determining fairness. Since <italic>Jones Beach</italic><italic></italic><italic></italic>-heiress, Mary Gardiner Jones became the first woman to serve on FTC in 1964, she left in 1973. By 1975, she became the VP for Consumer Affairs at <italic>Western Union</italic>, a position earmarked for a woman, which she saw as an opportunity rather than tokenism. \nIn 1976, a landmark decision against <italic>Merrill </italic>eliminated discriminatory entrance exams, exemplified by questions like, \u201c<italic>When you fight with your spouse, who usually wins?</italic>\u201d and \u201c<italic>When you meet a woman, what interests you the most about her?</italic>\u201d (<italic>\u201c</italic><italic>H</italic><italic>er beauty</italic>\u201d garnered the most points, followed by \u201c<italic>her intelligence\u201d</italic>), as demonstrated by Helen O\u2019Bannon\u2019s successful lawsuit, which highlighted the challenge of proving subtle forms of discrimination, while also recognizing that employers can justify practices as essential for building business.\nWhen Jones left FTC, the female seat continued. Having campaigned for Kennedy-Johnson, Elizabeth Hanford graduated from <italic>Harvard </italic>Law in 1965, and served in key positions for President Johnson\u2019s consumer office, including as the associate director of legislative affairs. She eventually and became executive director of President Nixon\u2019s Commission on Consumer Interests. After replacing Mary Jones in 1973 on the female seat for FTC Commissioner, Elizabeth switched to being a Republican, and remained under Presidents Ford and Carter until 1979. While Patricia Bailey took the female seat at FTC until 1988, Elizabeth became the first female Secretary of Transportation and married North Carolina Senator Bob Dole.\nMoreover, Carter supported the women-heavy unions that elected him. Since the Democratic Party shifting primary voting to mass participation in 1968, Carter won with support from the decentralized teacher voting bloc, particularly <italic>National Education Association</italic> (\u201cNEA\u201d). As President, Carter strengthened the NEA\u2019s influence by elevating education policy to a cabinet-level priority in the Education Department.\nBack in 1969, <italic>Kuhn</italic> Partner Nathaniel Samuels left to serve in the State Department during the Nixon Administration. As Deputy Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, he filled a position vacant since Dillion. Robert Lehman, meanwhile, hired the State Department\u2019s George Ball and Harold Fitzgibbons. \nAlong with involvement in WWII prince controls, Fitzgibbons\u2019 father ran a leather manufacturing firm in Massachusetts and sat on boards of <italic>Brockton</italic> NB and  his maternal grandfather and uncle dominated <italic>Rockland Trust</italic>, <italic>Rockland Savings</italic>, and coal and leather shoe businesses. After Lehman died in 1969, his cousin-in-law Fred Ehrman became the Chair of <italic>Lehman</italic>. While Commerce Secretary Peter Peterson chose Rohatyn to manage his blind trust, Peterson joined <italic>Lehman</italic> by 1972. \nLikewise, <italic>Lehman</italic> hired Roger Altman, a working-class Catholic Bostonian and politically active <italic>Uni of Chicago </italic>business student, who became the youngest partner in the firm\u2019s history and continued Democrat fundraising. As Theodore Roosevelt IV left the State Department for <italic>Lehman</italic>, Nathaniel Samuels resigned from the State Department and returned to <italic>Kuhn</italic>, as a general partner in 1972. By 1975, Samuels was elected Chair of Paris-based grain shipper <italic>Dreyfus.</italic> While a limited partner at <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Dreyfus </italic>expanded into the global gas and petroleum markets, positioning itself as a major player in the energy sector. \nAmidst the <italic>Vietnam War</italic> and inflation, Conservatives regained Parliament and PM Heath invited <italic>Rothschild</italic> London to privatize his predecessor\u2019s <italic>Industrial Reorg Corp</italic> by 1970. As <italic>Rolls Royce</italic> fell into receivership, <italic>Rothschild</italic> tried to organize an IPO, but low bids and labor strikes put that plan on hold. Since de-cartelizing banks, BOE allowed them to buy lessors, and lend to <italic>secondaries</italic> by 1971. Joining <italic>NatWest</italic>\u2019s Board in 1972, Robin Leigh-Pemberton\u2014a descendant of King Charles II, <italic>Touche</italic> of Dublin, and the founding family of aristocratic Scottish bank <italic>Drummond</italic>\u2014became Deputy Chair in 1975, and Chair in 1977.\nIn 1971, <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s Harold Fitzgibbons married Ruth Huggins, the daughter of a former Governor of Jamaica, whose marriage to a Smyth descendant ended in divorce. While Fitzgibbons joined <italic>Hambro</italic> the following year,  Ruth\u2019s sister married Smyth descendant Charles Cobbold Hambro, Chair of <italic>Hambro</italic>, in 1976.\nIn 1972, <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> Chair and BOE non-executive director Gordon Richardson\u2014who began his career at the <italic>Lazard</italic> London-promoted <italic>Industrial & Commercial Finance Corp</italic> and had been a director of <italic>Imperial Chemical Industries</italic> (\u201cICI\u201d) and <italic>Rolls Royce</italic>\u2014became Chair of the newly-created <italic>Industrial Development Advisory Board</italic> to promote government investment in industry. The same year, the receiver reorged <italic>Rolls Royce</italic>\u2019s profitable car business and hired Fraser from the <italic>Panel on Takeovers & Mergers</italic> as Chair. Likewise, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Poole hired Fraser. As Head of <italic>Pearson</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> London, Oliver Poole attempted to bridge the gap between <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s British and American factions. Aiming to align with Andr\u00e9 Meyer, Poole pursued aggressive and deal-making. \nPoole\u2019s other 1972 hires include David Verey\u2014son of <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic>\u2019s Chair Michael Verey\u2014, Gordon Richardson, and Marcus Agius. Lacking a pedigree, Richardson had married the daughter of Britain\u2019s most notable Anglican parish priest, Reverend Sheppard, and joined <italic>Industrial & Commercial Finance Corp</italic>. Agius joined <italic>Vickers</italic> in 1968, until marrying Kate Rothschild, a Katz-cousin descended from Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, in 1971. Becoming a cousin-in-law of the Huths through the Rothschilds, Agius moved to <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1972. \nAgius descended from Anglo-Maltese dynasties. After Giuseppe Coen revealed a conspiracy by Turkish slaves to Grand Master of Malta in 1749, Coen\u2019s son married into the Tagliaferro family in 1774. In 1806, Napoleon\u2019s Blockade turned Malta into a center for contraband trade and later Britain\u2019s Mediterranean military headquarters. In 1809, William Higgins founded <italic>Anglo Maltese Bank</italic> with Maltese John Vella for the first Manager. As <italic>Banco di Malta</italic> started after the blockade in 1812, Biagio Tagliaferro established <italic>Tagliaferro</italic>, focusing on shipping and venture capital. By 1851, Biagio Tagliaferro joined Matla\u2019s Currency Board, and in 1854, helped manage Malta\u2019s commercial quays and lighthouses. In 1872, Vella descendant Edward Agius established a Mediterranean trade empire in London and his son married a Coen Tagliaferro descendant. After WWII, <italic>Anglo Maltese Bank</italic> and <italic>Banco di Malta</italic> merged into <italic>National Bank of Malta</italic> in 1946. By 1969, <italic>Tagliaferro</italic> acquired <italic>National Bank of Malta</italic>. \nMeanwhile, Far East shipper <italic>Peninsular & Oriental</italic> <italic>Shipping</italic> (\u201cP&O\u201d) engaged <italic>McKinsey</italic> to consolidate their ventures into a vessel operating company in 1971, Donald Anderson retired as Chair, and his cousin Ford Geddes took over. Donald\u2019s daughter married David Loehnis, a fifth great nephew of <italic>Coutt</italic><italic>s</italic> founder James Coutts, who started with the British Diplomatic Service in the 1960s until joining <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> in 1967. Since Ford\u2019s cousin Reay Geddes, worked at BOE, married a granddaughter of gold refiner <italic>Johnson</italic>\u2019s first Chair Matthey in 1938, and joined <italic>Dunlop</italic>, where his father had previously been Chair. <italic>Dunlop</italic> soon found herself in need of <italic>Lazard </italic>London\u2019s services. \nBy 1970, French <italic>Michelin</italic> surpassed <italic>Pirelli</italic> in tire innovation with the launch of steel-belted radial tires. Seven years prior to Italian <italic>Pirelli</italic>, <italic>Michelin</italic> entered the American cable market. Amid criticism of focusing more on calendars than tires, <italic>Michelin</italic> responded by forming a strategic R&D alliance with British <italic>Dunlop</italic>, led by Reay Geddes and advised by <italic>Lazard</italic> London. The company faced difficulties in the rubber tire market and merged with <italic>Pirelli</italic> in 1971. As <italic>Pirelli</italic> ran out of cash within a year, <italic>Dunlop</italic>\u2019s finances destabilized. Despite Geddes claiming <italic>Lazard </italic>had endorsed the merger, this was contested. After consulting with key directors like Archie Sinclair of <italic>Midland Bank</italic> and John Read of EMI, <italic>Lazard </italic>London asked Reay Geddes to resign. Geddes refused and dismissed <italic>Lazard </italic>London as <italic>Dunlop</italic>\u2019s advisers the following day.\nIn May 1972, Poole and several other <italic>Lazard</italic> London partners joined the board of P&O. Around then <italic>Warburg</italic> engineered the take-over of <italic>Royal Mail </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> by property company <italic>Trafalgar House</italic>. <italic>Trafalgar</italic>\u2019s success prompted property company <italic>Bovis</italic> to hire <italic>Lazard</italic> London to advise on buying P&O in August, which Poole saw as an opportunity to diversify P&O. Despite not having a direct client, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> opposed <italic>Bovis</italic>\u2019 bid on behalf of P&O shareholders.\nFounded by descendants of James Mackay to house their interests, <italic>Inachape</italic>\u2019s claim to P&O dated back to 1914 and partnership with<italic> Mackinnon Mackenzie</italic>. <italic>Inchcape</italic> hired <italic>Jardine</italic>-affiliated <italic>Fleming</italic> to bid for P&O. Exhausted, Poole appointed Fraser to negotiate. As <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> petitioned P&O that they would serve their interests as financial advisors better than <italic>Lazard</italic> London, P&O retained <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> without board seats to provide expertise without control. \nWhile P&O rejected <italic>Inchcape</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>higher bid, media and shareholders drove Ford Geddes and<italic> Lazard</italic> London directors to resign from P&O\u2019s board, and <italic>Inchcape</italic> gained their seats by 1973. The P&O disaster put clients in a panic and spurred them to run. <italic>Woolworth</italic>, <italic>Chloride</italic>, <italic>Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance</italic>, and <italic>Standard Chartered Bank</italic> left <italic>Lazard</italic> London within weeks as other threatened. When Poole returned, he delegated <italic>British Petroleum</italic>, <italic>Unilever</italic>, and <italic>Dunlop</italic> to Fraser.\nWhile Poole tried to merge <italic>Lazard</italic> London with British securities firm <italic>Slater</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Walker</italic>, Meyer intervened to halt the merger, distancing <italic>Lazard</italic> London from <italic>SlaterWalker</italic>\u2019s subsequent failure. As Poole suffered a stroke, leading Daniel Meinertzhagen\u2014a Smyth and Rothschild cousin-in-law\u2014and Nigel Fraser replaced him as Chair and CEO<italic> </italic>of<italic> Lazard</italic> London, respectively. \nWith a tarnished reputation and lower risk appetite, Fraser returned <italic>Lazard</italic> London to its traditional \u2018sleepy\u2019 role of facilitating and defending takeover bids, disappointing Meyer\u2019s hopes for building relationship-based ventures. The same year, Daniel Meinertzhagen\u2019s brother Peter became General Manager of <italic>Commonwealth Development Corp</italic>, Britain\u2019s international development arm. Since 1971, their brother Lucas led <italic>Cazenove</italic>, Britain\u2019s premier merchant bank for corporate finance. Daniel\u2019s son Peter joined <italic>Hoare</italic>\u2014a peer broker of <italic>Cazenove</italic> and <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic>\u2014in 1965 as a postal clerk, becoming partner in 1973, and continuing to ascend from there. Together the family linked corporate and development merchant banking.\nDespite the Dutch discovering a vast natural gas field in the North Sea in 1959, it was not until 1969 that Britain and Norway began drilling. By 1972, Parliament replaced both the <italic>Gas Council</italic> and <italic>Gas Boards</italic> with the <italic>British Gas Corp</italic> in 1973 that the complete replacement of coal-based energy with natural gas occurred. In America, Congress allowed oil producers to raise prices but extended the 1971 crude controls to all petroleum and taxed large oil refineries to finance nuclear research. \nAs oil imports grew, BHCs hedged FX risk with MMEU and, as BHCA1970 regulated CP, floated CP-issuing C&D REITs. <italic>Lazard</italic> New York<italic> </italic>merged <italic>Peerage </italic>into CPI. Amidst defaults and scandals, Congress paused HUD subsidies in January 1973, and investors ran from C&D. And as Congress did not ease railroad merger NOCs, coalers struck, and <italic>PENN</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s bankruptcy judge moved to liquidate. With depositors running from banks, Nixon floated the <italic>dollar</italic> from gold, quelling <italic>dollar</italic> inflation and ending <italic>Bretton Woods</italic>. FRS suspended <italic>Reg Q </italic>for large CDs. \nIn April, Nixon replaced 1959\u2019s oil import quotas\u2014that led to OPEC\u2014with tariffs for domestic production. Soon after, he appointed Henry Wallich to FRS to focus on price stability. A second grandnephew of Count Joseph Cah\u00e9n, grandson of a converted <italic>Deutsche</italic> partners, and son of the Lutheran Paul Wallich who was a former co-owner of <italic>Berliner </italic>and <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt before committing suicide in 1938, Henry moved from Berlin to New York in 1935, working at <italic>Chemical</italic> NB and later <italic>Hackney Hopkinson Sutphen</italic>. However, he left banking after earning a PhD from <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1944 and joined FRS <italic>New York</italic> in 1941, where he remained through his life. Also in 1970, <italic>Berliner </italic>fused with <italic>Frankfurter</italic> into <italic>Berliner Frankfurter Bank</italic>.\nDespite American efforts, Chile\u2019s Marxist Salvador Allende became president and began nationalizing industries. In late June 1971, America abstained on <italic>BANK</italic> loans to Bolivia and Guyana due to expropriation disputes. A month later, Guyana nationalized aluminum. While America denied ECGD credits to Chile to buy <italic>Boeing</italic> jets as a response to expropriation, <italic>Lazard</italic> London the British ECGD provided a line of credit for Chile\u2019s steel industry. Meanwhile, <italic>Anaconda</italic> and <italic>Kennecott</italic> copper miners dominated Chilean exports. By 1972, Allende nationalized the copper industry in Chile with the active cooperation of copper companies and America to prevent the Socialist Party from exploiting the issue in the elections.\nOne of those French President Charles Gaulle selected for his administration was Fran\u00e7ois Missoffe. While his Vice Admiral father and uncle were associated with <italic>Unilever</italic>, Missoffe wed a Wendel Vitry descended from Thellusson whose cousin married a Laborde Seilli\u00e8re. His sister wed <italic>Paribas</italic> Director Maurice Rambuteau in 1954, a son of Count of Rambuteau, who died for France in deportation, and a daughter of French Princess Marguerite d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. \nMissoffe\u2019s brother married Louis Tronc, President of <italic>Nationale</italic> from 1947 until he became a senator in 1957. Another Wendel Vitry sister married Jean Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet, whose roles ranged from Chair of can-maker <italic>Carnaud</italic> to the French Secretary General in 1976. While Jean\u2019s brother married a Hottinguer in 1958, brother Michel joined <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1961 after <italic>Harvard</italic> Business. From an executive assistant, he soon became deputy director, and continued rising. By 1972, Michel married Swiss private banker Pictet. Soon after, their nephew\u2019s brother-in-law married a daughter of Jacques Rothschild Thierry, an executive at<italic> </italic><italic>Lambert</italic> and then <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>.\nMeanwhile, as international competition crowded out family firms, merchant bankers\u2014with former senior civil servants as partners\u2014restructured industrial finance, accelerated under <italic>Rothschild</italic> alum President Georges Pompidou. After <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Pierre Weill Andr\u00e9 and Meyer advised Antoine Riboud\u2019s BSN failed to takeover glass maker <italic>Saint-Gobain </italic>in 1968, shareholders <italic>Neuflize Schlumberger Mallet </italic>and <italic>Suez</italic> merged <italic>Saint-Gobain</italic> with construction firm <italic>Pont-\u00e0-Mousson</italic> in 1969 and merged with fellow Huguenot banks <italic>Andr\u00e9</italic> and <italic>Vernes</italic> by 1970 and, the following year, <italic>Commercial Bank of Paris</italic>. \nSecuring control of <italic>Industriel</italic> in a battle against <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1971, <italic>Suez</italic> then sought to gain control of <italic>Indochine</italic>. To gain<italic> Indochine</italic> shares from <italic>Paternelle Assurances</italic>, <italic>Suez</italic> split their insurance JV, enabling <italic>Paribas</italic> to take control of insurer <italic>LaProvidence</italic>. Since Jacques Fouchier founded what became <italic>Co Bancaire</italic> with backing from <italic>Parisienne</italic> in the 1950s, his brother Louis joined <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Nord</italic>, rising from attach\u00e9 in 1964 to CEO. In 1968, he linked the bank to <italic>Paribas</italic>, where Jacques had become President. Growing closer to <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Co Bancaire</italic> was <italic>Parisienne</italic>\u2019s largest borrower. After Jacques integrated <italic>Co Bancaire</italic> into <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1973, Louis merged <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Nord</italic> with <italic>Parisienne</italic> in 1974.\nWhile <italic>Suez</italic> allied internationally with <italic>Insurance Co of North America</italic> engage in MMEU and MMEA, <italic>Paribas</italic> allied with <italic>Bank of America</italic>, <italic>Banca Commerciale</italic> <italic>Italiana</italic>, <italic>Vereins-Bank</italic>, and <italic>Warburg</italic> London. While <italic>Paribas</italic> allied with <italic>Warburg</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, and <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic><italic> </italic>since 1967, <italic>Warburg</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> formed <italic>Paribas</italic> <italic>Warburg</italic><italic> </italic>in 1973, each holding 50%. The new entity acquired 25% of <italic>Paribas</italic> and 20% of her Belgian, Dutch, and Swiss subsidiaries, giving <italic>Warburg</italic> a 12.5% stake in <italic>Paribas</italic> and 10% in each subsidiary. <italic>Paribas</italic> took 25% of <italic>Warburg</italic>. Ending family control that month, <italic>Warburg Continuation</italic> merged into <italic>Mercury Securities</italic>.\nLike <italic>Paribas</italic> restructured steel firm <italic>Usinor</italic> and merged <italic>Ch\u00e2tillon-Commentry</italic> and <italic>Br\u00e2che</italic> in 1969, <italic>Suez</italic> merged <italic>Sidelor</italic> with <italic>Wendel </italic>in 1970 to create <italic>Wendel Sidelor</italic>. In 1973, <italic>Suez</italic> merged <italic>Wendel Sidelor</italic> with <italic>Marine Firminy</italic><italic> </italic>into <italic>Sacilor</italic>. After buying uranium and aluminum miner <italic>Mokta</italic> from <italic>Suez</italic>, the Rothschilds consolidated management in their <italic>Nickel</italic>, <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic>, and other metal and mining operations into what became <italic>Imetal</italic>. The following year, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris advised <italic>Pechiney</italic> to merge with <italic>Ugine</italic> into PUK, which contracted steel, aluminum, and nuclear supplies with the Soviet Union and India. \nSince Jules Aubrun left <italic>Schneider</italic>\u2019s <italic>Creusot</italic> to join <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in 1929, he served as <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s steel representative, including on the boards of <italic>Batignolles</italic> from the 1930s, and <italic>Paribas</italic> from 1945 until his death in 1959, his grandchild\u2019s father-in-law, Louis Dherse, became Chair of <italic>Wendel Sidelor</italic> and then <italic>Wendel </italic><italic>Sacilor</italic>. Likewise, Dherse\u2019s son was Executive Vice President of <italic>Pechiney</italic> from 1968 to 1970, and Director PUK from 1972.\nAnother of PUK\u2019s directors was Ren\u00e9 Fillon, Guy Rothschild\u2019s former tutor and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 Attorney-in-Fact during WWII. Leaving in 1954 to be a senator in French Sudan, Fillon returned to be President of <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise de Minerais d\u2019Uranium</italic> in 1957. He also became President of <italic>d\u2019Investissements Fran\u00e7ais Immobiliers</italic> and VP of <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya</italic> from 1966, Administrator of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris from 1968, and Chair and CEO of <italic>Mines d\u2019Uranium de Bakouma</italic> in 1969. Expanding from <italic>Pe\u00f1arroya </italic>in 1971, he joined the boards of PUK, <italic>Nickel</italic>, <italic>Mokta</italic>, and others. By 1973, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris acquired <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Priv\u00e9</italic>, which earlier bought the remains of the 19th century mining bank <italic>Fould Oppenheim </italic>through <italic>Heine</italic> Paris.\nBy 1972, <italic>Empain</italic> <italic>Schneider</italic> took over <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic>, long kinterlinked with <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Weill family. With <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Pierre Weill sat on <italic>Paribas\u2019</italic> board since Jules Aubrun died in 1959, <italic>Paribas</italic> integrated cement manufacturers<italic> </italic><italic>Poliet-et-Chausson</italic> and <italic>Lafarge</italic>. While the Laguionie family sold the <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris banked <italic>Printemps</italic> to Swiss retailer <italic>Maus Nordmann</italic> in 1972, <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> facilitated BSN\u2019s absorption of <italic>Gervais Danone </italic>the following year.\nAs <italic>Chase</italic> joined <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Bank of America</italic>, and other Western banks to open branches to Moscow, David Karr brokered <italic>Occidental</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>record Soviet barter contract in April 1973. Having written for socialist newspapers in the 1920s, American-born David Katz (of unknown relation to the Katzenellenbogen family) reinvented himself as David Karr in Paris in the early 1960s and set up <italic>Financial Engineers</italic> in the Bahamas to broker messages and events for Senator Kennedy and others to the Deputy Chair of the <italic>Science & Technology</italic> <italic>Committee </italic>and Premier Kosygin\u2019s son-in-law. \nHowever, the coal miners\u2019 strike of 1972 unleashed energy shortages across London and forced <italic>McKinsey</italic> and other firms to shutter. BOE floated the <italic>pound</italic> in 1972. The crisis led to the introduction of restrictive measures and squeezed <italic>secondaries</italic> credit, as BOE hiked lending rates from 7.5 to 13% within five-months. As Keynesianism kept Britain from competing with Asia, PM Heath replaced Leslie O\u2019Brien by promoting <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> Chair Gordon Richardson from non-executive Director to BOE Governor in 1973.\nSince developing Sinai oil and Iranian oil pipes, Israel elected Golda Meir as her first female PM. By 1973, Jamaica led neighbors in hiking aluminum taxes before OPEC shocked global energy in October. On one of Judaism\u2019s holiest days, Yom Kippur, Soviet-financed Egypt and Syria nearly destroyed Israel to recapture the Sinai. As America and Europe supported Israel, OPEC embargoed Europe as well as apartheid South Africa, Mozambique, and Rhodesia. After Meir resigned, Israel devalued her <italic>shekel</italic>, hiked PU prices, and promoted exports. While Arabs blacklisted <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and <italic>Warburg</italic> for several years, leading British PUs to exclude the Jewish banks from operations. \nSince FDR\u2019s 1945 agreement with Saudi Arabia, the Western corporate global oil cartel created excess capacity and allowed TRC to be a swing supplier of last resort to America, Europe, and Japan. But Texas could not replace Saudi Arabia. Since Iran\u2019s oil nationalization in 1951 and the 1954 consortium agreement with Western companies, Iran\u2019s revenues grew. Likewise, Iran implemented land reforms and expanded education following the revolution of 1963. \nA year after <italic>Bank Melli</italic>, the country\u2019s largest commercial bank, branched to London in 1967, <italic>Citi</italic> acquired 35% of <italic>Bank-e Iranian</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Chase</italic> maintained strong relations with <italic>Melli</italic>, the central bank <italic>Bank Markazi</italic>, and the oil monopoly <italic>Anglo-Iranian</italic>. While only Iranian <italic>Bank Melli</italic>, Iraqi <italic>Rafidain</italic>, and the European-origin <italic>TURK</italic> had London offices in the late 1960s, over two dozen Middle Eastern banks formed there through the 1970s. Iranian and Turkish banks, lacking national joint institutions, opened separate offices, including <italic>Bazargani</italic>, <italic>Pars</italic>, <italic>Saderat</italic>, <italic>Sepah</italic>, <italic>Akbank</italic>, <italic>Ziraat</italic>, <italic>Turkiye Is</italic>, and <italic>Yapi ve Kredi</italic>.\nUST eliminated capital controls to finance energy imports by yearend 1973. With OPEC reinvesting into MMEU, American banks borrowed the <italic>dollar</italic> credits. As more coal roads around <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic> failed, <italic>Kuhn</italic> advised Congress on a private-public partnership reorg. By March, the Court rebuffed DOJ to support 1967\u2019s Midwest coal cartel. FRS hiked rates to 8% and OPEC lifted the embargo. As inflation grew, FRS raised rates to 12%. \nAs depositors ran from <italic>secondaries</italic>, BOE established a support fund and imposed retail rate caps. Without privatized bankruptcy and competitive liquidation,<italic> </italic>banks supported <italic>secondaries</italic> for years until one<italic> </italic>filed for bankruptcy in 1975. As <italic>NatWest</italic>\u2019s stock price dipped below par, <italic>Cazenove</italic> Senior Partner Luke Meinertzhagen reassured the market the bank was sound, while his brother <italic>Lazard</italic> London Chair Daniel Meinertzhagen chaired <italic>Mercantile Credit</italic> and restored confidence in secondary banks by orchestrating a recovery operation with major banks. By 1974, <italic>Bovis</italic> faced losses since buying a <italic>secondary</italic> bank, P&O bought it with <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic>\u2019s advice at a discount from the <italic>Lazard</italic> London proposal of 1972.\nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>, DOJ litigation concerning director interlocks and anticompetitive practices surged since the Court allowed broader public values in determining fairness in 1972. Instead of secured credit, banks interlocked directorates like in Europe, which as DOJ investigated for AA1914. Fusing into FEA into DOE, Congress reorged FPC into <italic>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission </italic>(\u201cFERC\u201d), which increased enforcement of PA1935 against financial interlocks with PUHCs. \nLike <italic>Kuhn</italic> in 1973, <italic>Loeb</italic> had negative profits in 1974 for the first since the 1930s. As the bond market collapsed, <italic>Salomon</italic> experienced a large loss. <italic>Lehman</italic> suffered even larger losses due to a bet that UST rates would remain steady and unsold CP and required a large capital injection from <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic>. Since Glucksman led the firm\u2019s debt, Ehrman sought to force him out. \nInstead, the board ousted Ehrman out and appointed his nephew, Fred Hellman, as the firm\u2019s youngest President. Peterson was appointed CEO and, soon after, Chair, with Glucksman as his second in command. Having considered <italic>First Manhattan</italic>, <italic>Blyth</italic>, <italic>White</italic> <italic>Weld</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and others for an American partner, <italic>Paribas Warburg</italic> selected <italic>Becker</italic> of Chicago.\nSince Jamaica led the Caribbean in hiking aluminum taxes in 1973, America blocked Caribbean multilateral loans, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> and other banks financed aluminum in Australia, UAE\u2019s Dubai, and Brazil as industry relocated from Japan and the Caribbean. <italic>Mitsui</italic> invested in <italic>AMAX</italic>\u2019s aluminum plant. In the spirt of the <italic>Bretton Woods</italic> agreement, the Saudis and the Gulf agreed to invoice and trade oil in <italic>dollars</italic> in exchange for miliary protection. \nAs the Saudis agreed to buy UST debt and meet annually with UST for American investment, mostly through <italic>Chase</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic>, invested in naval defense across the Gulf from 1974. Before long, Western tech made the Soviet Union into the second largest aluminum producer. However, Central American banana taxes and Hurricane Fifi\u2019s destruction by 1974 resulted in major losses at <italic>United Fruit Co</italic>. Since <italic>Lehman</italic>-alum Eli Blachowitz \u201cBlack\u201d reformed farming giant <italic>United Fruit Co</italic> from exploitation to working with labor unions, he committed suicide shortly after.\nBefore the resolution, the <italic>Panic of 1973</italic> reshaped banking and industry. With few ECGD guarantees\u2014unlike Britain and France\u2014German banks risked interest rates in rolling-over short-term MMEU loans. By 1973, Germany\u2019s largest private bank, <italic>Herstatt</italic>, processed 24 billion <italic>marks</italic> in FX transactions, accounting for 23 times the bank\u2019s equity. As high rates grew FX trading losses from 64 to 520 million <italic>marks</italic>, <italic>Herstatt </italic>closed mid-day before MMEU settled. \nDespite efforts by insurer <italic>Gerling</italic> and banks like <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, and <italic>Commerzbank</italic> to rescue the bank, negotiations failed. Since German courts stayed the debt without receiverships, Arab investors and Swiss banks ran from MMEU as <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Herstatt</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>New York correspondent, closed transactions, collapsing MMEU. Rates also squeezed C&Ds. With investors running from REITs, credit agencies downgraded CP. Unable to build reserves or reduce payouts without losing tax privileges, REITs turned to bank credit until BHCs bailed out their sponsored vehicles and then the industry. \nAmidst oil inflation of 1973 and facing competition from <italic>Michelin</italic>, <italic>Fiat</italic> dissolved her <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> link. So, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Jean Guyot helped <italic>Michelin</italic> sell her stake in bankrupt <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> to <italic>Peugeot</italic>. And as heavy death duties forced France to allow the German <italic>Hoechst</italic> to takeover <italic>Roussel</italic> in 1974, <italic>Peugeot Citro\u00ebn</italic> was France\u2019s last large family-owned firm. That year, Val\u00e9ry Estaing became President of France. \nWhile his father served as Chair of the <italic>Homberg</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris-founded <italic>French & Colonial</italic> HC, his aunt was the daughter of a former president, and cousin once removed of <italic>Suez</italic>\u2019s Jacques Georges-Picot. Estaing\u2019s wife was the granddaughter of Eugene Schneider and a cousin of Michel Poniatowski, a descendant of the last King of Poland, who was appointed Minister of the Interior. Within a year, <italic>Suez </italic>fused with <italic>Indochine</italic> into <italic>Indochine</italic> <italic>Suez</italic>, the largest bank east of <italic>Suez Canal</italic>.\nBy then, Victor Gerashchenko returned to Moscow as <italic>Vneshtorg</italic> deputy manager from <italic>Narodny</italic> Beirut. When Karr demanded to be a partner in the deals, Hammer severed ties with him, Karr leaked information about Hammer\u2019s business dealings to SEC. In 1974, Karr partnered with <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. To further facilitate business in the Soviet Union, Karr and <italic>Lazard</italic> partnered with <italic>Financial Engineers</italic> into Swiss-domiciled <italic>Finatec</italic>, accredited by <italic>Vneshtorg</italic>. \nUnder Karr, <italic>Finatec</italic> advised <italic>Peugeot Citro\u00ebn</italic>, <italic>Mitsubishi</italic>, and other clients in Soviet Union business. <italic>Finatec</italic> financed the West\u2019s first turnkey construction sale to the Soviet Union, Moscow\u2019s <italic>Cosmos Hotel</italic>. As America\u2019s EXIM<italic> </italic>limited credits to the Soviet Union to $300 million over four years, <italic>Bank of America</italic> and other banks competed to fill the credit void. <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 David Karr arranged for a $250 million loan in 1975, the first Soviet international syndicate with around 20 Western banks.\nVladimir Ponomarev, a second cousin of Boris Ponomarev of the Soviet Union\u2019s Central Committee, headed  <italic>Vneshtorg</italic> until becoming the VP of <italic>Narodny</italic> Paris in the early 1970s. Leading <italic>Narodny</italic> Paris from 1965, Guy Boysson\u2014born into an aristocratic family and married Genevi\u00e8ve Chevrillon, whose uncle had married a Porges Schnapper cousin of the Rothschilds at the turn of the century\u2014became President by 1978. Guy\u2019s cousin Max was a Director of <italic>Morgan </italic>Paris from 1967 until 1973, when he became a Director of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Banque</italic>, affiliated with the Mallet Vernes and Goldschmidt Deutsch-Meurthe oil families. \nIn 1974, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> hired Quentin Davies as Assistant Director in France. Born in Britain, Davies had joined the Foreign Office and served in Moscow from 1969. By 1979, Davies became President of <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> France. By 1977, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> and <italic>Bank of Scotland</italic> set up a JV with <italic>Narodny</italic> in Moscow to arrange and provide EGGD-backed credits.\nSince <italic>Chase</italic> helped finance the Soviet grain deal in 1972, David Rockefeller began discussions with Soviet authorities to open operations in Moscow. That year, the Soviets granted <italic>Chase</italic> permission to establish an office, the first American bank with such a license. Soon after, the Soviets allowed other American banks to open offices in Moscow. While <italic>Citi</italic> established a branch under Nixon administration pressure, CEO Walter Wriston was unenthused and the branch generated little business.\nWhile Rockefeller had proposed James Billington to head <italic>Chase</italic> Moscow, the Ambassador suggested sending someone else, as the Soviets would provide interpreters. So he chose Alfred Wentworth. A son of <italic>Stone </italic><italic>Webster</italic> VP, Wentworth became assistant manager at <italic>Chase</italic> in New York in 1946. From 1960, he was VP in London, then Senior VP in New York from 1968. In 1972, he opened <italic>Chase</italic> Moscow.\nDavid Buckman followed Wentworth. Born in Reno, Buckman married into the Lewers family. Having pioneered Reno, the Lewers were associated with <italic>Bank of Nevada</italic> and <italic>Anglo-California Trust</italic>. After working for <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Nevada</italic> in Reno, he joined <italic>Chase</italic> in 1961 as an assistant treasurer in the International Department as branch manager in Nigeria. Following <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s investment in <italic>Standard Bank</italic>, Buckman became Executive Director of <italic>Standard Bank</italic> Nigeria. After Nigeria\u2019s revolution, he was based in New York, then appointed representative for Scandinavia. In 1975, he succeeded Wentworth at <italic>Chase</italic> Moscow.\nBy then, however, the <italic>Watergate</italic> scandal revealed illegal presidential campaign contributions by oil companies. As Nixon resigned in 1974, Ford became president. As creditors ran from banks and CP, bankruptcies devastated PUHCs, railroads, and cities. Since PA1935 limited PUHCs from issuing HC bonds, SEC waived competitive CP bidding requirements in 1974. With cheap <italic>dollars</italic> and high energy prices, Arabs, Rohatyn-advised <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>, and <italic>Mitsui</italic> bought an interest in <italic>AMAX</italic>\u2019s aluminum plant. \nBy 1975, <italic>AMAX</italic> sold a minority interest to <italic>OIL</italic> <italic>of California</italic>. As Ford lifted FDR\u2019s private gold ban that year, <italic>Safra</italic> joined <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Standard Chartered</italic> <italic>Mocatta</italic> <italic>Goldsmid</italic>, <italic>Johnson</italic> (owned by <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> since the <italic>MINERAL</italic> merger), <italic>Midland </italic><italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic>, and <italic>Kleinwort Benson Sharp Pixley</italic> to trade gold with Swiss banks. Germany exported ECGD-guaranteed oil to South Africa for gold. \nWhile <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Rohatyn tried to merge <italic>Lockheed</italic> with <italic>Textron</italic>, but UST bailed her out in 1973. Since convincing <italic>Kidder</italic> to reorg in <italic>Intra</italic> in 1967, Arab Christian Roger Tamraz formed <italic>First Arabian Corp</italic> and took over Detroit banks, but the <italic>Pentagon</italic> blocked his <italic>Lockheed</italic> bid in 1974. Along with seeding <italic>First Arabian</italic>, Gaith Pharaon\u2014the Royal Saudi Physician\u2019s son\u2014invested Saudi funds with <italic>Bank of Credit & Commerce International</italic> (\u201cBCCI\u201d) loans into banks and real estate from 1972. As <italic>Morgan</italic> bought 40% of <italic>Intra</italic>\u2019s banking arm in Beirut in 1973, Rodney Wagner rejoined <italic>Morgan</italic> after a decade with <italic>Agency for International Development</italic> (\u201cUSAID\u201d) to lead the effort. These transactions helped Lebanese gold bridge Middle Eastern oil. \nMeanwhile, American family partnerships fell apart. Since <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic>,<italic> Merrill</italic>, and other brokers lobbied to overturn NYSE\u2019s old rule preventing securities firms from going public for national and product diversification in 1970, the longstanding family partnership model that limited risk taking withered. Similarly, the transition from fault-based to no-fault divorce laws began with California in 1969, followed by all states but New York. This legal shift removed the need to prove fault, such as adultery or cruelty, to obtain a divorce. As courts divided assets more equitably without regard for fault, divorce rates surged.\nShortly after going public, William Donaldson left <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette </italic>to join Henry Kissinger at the State Department<italic> </italic>in 1973 and subsequently helped found <italic>Yale</italic> Business. From a previous generation, only Carl Loeb and John Schiff remained active. While <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Frederick Warburg, Robert Lehman, and <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Sidney Weinberg and Gustave Levy died, Andr\u00e9 Meyer and Clarence Dillon became less active at their age. \nAfter failing to buy <italic>Hornblower Weeks</italic>, <italic>Smith Barney</italic> bought <italic>Upham</italic>, <italic>Dean Witter</italic> negotiated with <italic>Unterberg Towbin</italic>. As his old firm <italic>Drexel Burnham</italic> acquired <italic>Lambert</italic> Boston to form <italic>Drexel Burnham Lambert</italic> (\u201cDBL\u201d) in 1976, Sanford Weill\u2019s <italic>Shearson Hayden</italic> bought regional <italic>Faulkner</italic> and commodities <italic>Lamson</italic> brokers, <italic>Dean Witter</italic> merged with <italic>Reynolds</italic> in a record merger in 1977, and <italic>Loeb</italic> went public. \nWhile the Schiff family sought to sell <italic>Kuhn</italic>, bought several, began negotiations with <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s international partner convinced <italic>Kuhn</italic> sold herself to the more international <italic>Lehman </italic>in 1977, forming <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic> under the leadership of John Schiff<italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>After his wife\u2014the granddaughter of <italic>First</italic> NB<italic> of New York</italic>\u2019s George Baker\u2014died in 1975, Schiff married Josephine Laimbeer in 1976. The sister of<italic> Citi</italic> Women\u2019s head in the 1920s, Josephine was married to <italic>Lehman</italic> partner John Fell\u2014a descendant of Anthony Drexel and <italic>Lehman</italic> partner since 1940\u2014until his death in 1961. \nSchiff\u2019s former brother-in-law, George Baker II, committed suicide in 1977. By 1978, Michael Langhorne Astor married Daphne Prune Schiff Warburg. Another international mixed matrimony was the wedding of Gianni Agnelli\u2019s Catholic daughter and the son of Jean-Paul Elkann, a French banker descended from the Jaffe family, who succeeded Alain Rothschild as President of the Jewish <italic>Consistory of Paris</italic> in 1967.\nBy 1976, losses also led Jacob\u2019s sister Dorothy to sell the <italic>New York Post</italic> to Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch, who was advised by <italic>Allen</italic>. The same crisis may have impacted RCA. Since marrying in 1949, Felicia Schiff Warburg divorced RCA\u2019s Roger Sarnoff and married fellow divorcee FDR Jr in 1970. Also in 1970, RCA bought<italic> Cushman Wakefield</italic>\u2014which had built and operated the world\u2019s largest building in the late 1960s, <italic>Sears Tower</italic>. However, RCA sold <italic>Cushman Wakefield </italic>to <italic>Rockefeller </italic>by 1976. <italic>Rockefeller </italic>also bought <italic>Tishman</italic>\u2019s construction and research division.\nLike the members of labor unions, leaders themselves spurred dynasties, included the Reuther brothers of UAW, John Lewis and his family in the <italic>United Mine Workers</italic>, and so on. Since the <italic>Civil Aeronautics Board</italic> cartelized trucking and airlines against competition, high led organized crime to capture unions and pillage airports and trucking. Congress enacted the <italic>Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Organizations Act</italic> (\u201cRICO\u201d) in 1970, but DOJ would not use RICO for a decade. But a case for it was building.\nIn the Vatican, the Church hired Michele Sindona to sell some shareholdings, diversifying their interests more abroad. Working with <italic>Hambro</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>,<italic> Gulf Western </italic>HC, and <italic>Continental Illinois</italic> NB, Sindona gained control of <italic>Societa Generale Immobiliare</italic> from the Church as he formed <italic>Fasco</italic> BHC, domiciled across<italic> </italic>Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Geneva. However, Sindona grew unpopular as socialists sought to nationalize PUs. \nTo continue anonymously banking the Pope but also members of the Costa Nostra crime syndicate, Sindona bought Long Island\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Franklin </italic>NB, from <italic>Lowe</italic> in 1972. As FRS stopped <italic>Fasco</italic> from buying another bank in 1973, <italic>Franklin</italic> missed a dividend May 1974. By June, Italy created a SEC-like disclosure regime. As <italic>Herstatt</italic><italic> </italic>destabilized FX and<italic> Fasco</italic>\u2019s credit, Sindona resigned after arrest warrants. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York benefited from the withdrawal of <italic>McKinsey</italic> from public service consulting. Back in 1968, <italic>McKinsey</italic> Principal Carter Bales secured an unpaid role as assistant director of the Budget Bureau in New York City while <italic>McKinsey</italic> received city consulting contracts. In 1969, the City awarded <italic>McKinsey</italic> $1.5 million in contracts for consulting services amidst a broader context of $75 million spent on consultants without competitive bidding. \nThe controversy intensified when <italic>New York Times</italic> reported on these and other practices in mid-1970, including <italic>McKinsey</italic> offering to pay officials. The City Council President argued that consultants often created an illusion of progress rather than solving real issues. A <italic>McKinsey</italic> representative admitted that consultants often secured contracts through social connections rather than merit. This scrutiny contributed to <italic>McKinsey</italic> shifting away from government contracts, eventually reducing its public sector work significantly by the end of the 1960s.<italic> </italic>\nTo increase municipal debt demand, Congress clarified the \u2018<italic>prudent man</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> </italic>rule for pension funds with the  (\u201cERISA\u201d). As Rohatyn led New York City\u2019s debt reorg with <italic>Citi</italic> Chair Wriston, he called for a new RFC, Congress refused. As the Governor discouraged bankruptcy, unions agreed to an IMF-like reorg in return for forced City debt sales to pensions per ERISA and paused debt payments. But as a court held the moratorium illegal in 1976, investors ran. While <italic>Allen</italic> bought the discounted debt, Rohatyn organized banks, and Congress eased municipal bankruptcy and extended NOCs. Within a year, Rohatyn sold <italic>PENN Central</italic>\u2019s <italic>Commodore Hotel</italic> to Donald Trump and <italic>Hyatt</italic> using a record forty-year tax abatement secured through Fred Trump\u2019s connections with the mayor to revitalize the city.\nSince 1971, insurers<italic> Aetna</italic>, <italic>St. Paul Fire & Marine</italic>, <italic>Connecticut General</italic>, and <italic>US Fire </italic>sought to invest in municipal bonds, founding MBIA to disburse risk. Guaranteeing her first bond in 1974, covering a water and sewer bond in Carbondale, Illinois, MBIA insured 500 new bonds, including those for New York, by 1977.  While Congress had exempted municipalities from disclosure requirements, SEC increased municipal bond broker and bank investor regulation in 1975. TA1976 relocated federal mineral lease revenues to local governments. To stabilize brokers, SEC linked capital to debt credit ratings instead of preferencing NYSE by restring capital. As credit rating agencies had avoided the securities firm regulations since the 1930s, SEC cartelized them to avoid ratings competition. \nWhile Sindona sold banks for liquidity, Italy\u2019s central bank appointed Giorgio Ambrosoli to liquidate one of the <italic>Fasco</italic> banks. Threatening Cuccia to reorg debt, Sindona had Ambrosoli killed in 1979 ahead of testifying. At the time, criminals continued to use the security of federal unions and grants. When HUD subsidized special window installation in public housing units in 1978, corrupt labor union Local 580 and the Genovese, Lucchese, Gambino, and Colombo Mafia families formed a cartel. \nAs the cartel manipulated bids for window contracts to inflate prices, non-Mafia companies also bought membership. As Italy arrested Milanese <italic>Banco Ambrosiano</italic>\u2019s Roberto Calvi for activities linked to Sindona in 1981, market collapse prompted the Treasury to close trading. As <italic>Ambrosiano</italic> failed and Calvi was found dead, the Vatican became implicated, the Pope appointed <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Hermann Abs to assist in the inquiry.\nAfter President James Carter deregulated trucking in the late 1970s, his successor, Ronald Reagan, started a war on organized crime, and assigned DOJ Italo-American Rudolph Giuliani. Instead of low-level piece-meal arrests, Giuliani pooled DOJ, FBI, DEA, IRS, and local and state police resources to go for Cosa Nostra from the top down. Before DOJ applied RICO to unions in 1988, Giuliani paired it with media soundbites against the mob for a public trial. Imprisoned and threatening to talk, Sindona received a coffee laced with cyanide in his cell in 1986. <italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of 1979, 1982, & 1984</italic>\nBefore FRS first adopted FA1933\u2019s <italic>Reg Q </italic>as a monetary policy tool in 1966, banks increasingly sold small CDs to retail depositors. Concerned that this competition disintermediated <italic>savings & loan associations</italic> (\u201cS&Ls\u201d) and slowed residential construction, FRS raised reserves and tightened <italic>Reg Q </italic>to inhibit deposit competition. As the <italic>Panic of 1966</italic> unfolded, residential construction fell, and banks sold UST bonds, leading FA1966 empower FRS to extend <italic>Reg Q</italic> caps to S&Ls, with a higher ceiling than for banks. \nWhen FRS used <italic>Reg Q</italic> in 1969 to restrict financing, banks evaded it by using security <italic>repurchase agreements</italic> (\u201crepos\u201d), issuing short-term CP, and selling UST debt. FRS ordered banks to hold reserves repos, exempting UST and Federal agency debt. As brokers collapsed in the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>, federalized NYSE\u2019s <italic>Fund</italic> with FDIC-like broker insurance and liquidation (\u201cSIPA\u201d), except for brokers dealing only mutual funds or municipal or UST securities.\nMeanwhile, banks innovated credit payments. In 1951, Long Island\u2019s <italic>Franklin</italic> NB introduced the inaugural bank-affiliated charge card. Initially, local businesses accepted this card, prompting numerous other banks to issue similar ones. However, these early cards had restricted geographical coverage with low profits. Seven years later, <italic>Bank of America</italic> launched the <italic>BankAmericard</italic>, which gained considerable traction in California thanks to effective marketing. <italic>BankAmericard</italic> allowed customers to pay in installments with a monthly finance charge. Other banks followed suit, issuing licensed <italic>BankAmericards</italic>. Concurrently, a consortium of Eastern banks established <italic>MasterCharge</italic>, later known as <italic>MasterCard</italic>. \nOne of the banks licensing <italic>BankAmericard</italic> was NB <italic>of Commerce of Seattle</italic>, which hired Dee Hock to manage the program in 1967. Hock, a Mormon, had graduated from <italic>Weber State College</italic> in 1949 and married a cousin-in-law of the Eccles banking and Prophet Joseph Smith families. He worked at <italic>Pacific Finance</italic>, in public relations and moved around a few companies. In 1968, Dee Hock led a committee addressing operational issues and, in 1970, separated the card from <italic>Bank of America</italic> into a company that became <italic>Visa</italic> in 1976.\nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1956</italic>, the Boston Brahmin-led <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> invested in their international operations in 1957 and funded <italic>Harvard</italic>-graduate An Wang, founder of <italic>Wang Laboratories</italic> by 1958. Helping revive Massachusetts\u2019 economy, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> soon funded <italic>Data General Corp</italic> and other high-tech companies. After <italic>Cabot</italic> petrochemical\u2019s Louis Cabot became a director of FRS <italic>Boston</italic> in 1970 and Chair in 1975,  he left in 1978 and joined <italic>Wang</italic>\u2019s board in 1982.\nOnly in 1960 did New York allowed New York City banks to branch into Westchester County. However, despite this change, banks continued to organize based on geographic lines. In 1968, <italic>McKinsey</italic> implemented a reorg of <italic>Citi</italic> using matrix management, focusing on function. As <italic>Citi</italic> overtook <italic>Bank of America</italic> as the most profitable bank, <italic>McKinsey</italic> helped other NBs, such as <italic>Continental Illinois</italic>, <italic>Chase</italic>, and <italic>Seattle First</italic>, undergo similar reorgs. Like <italic>McKinsey</italic> consulted for French <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, German <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, and Swiss <italic>Union Bank</italic>, British <italic>Midland</italic> and <italic>National Westminster</italic> hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> to adopt the multidivisional structure.\nSince BA1934 shifted management from bankers to consultants, Chicago\u2019s <italic>McKinsey</italic> led older consulting like <italic>Arthur Little</italic> and <italic>Booz</italic>. Once nearly a consulting monopoly, <italic>McKinsey</italic> was soon disrupted. Born in Tennessee in 1915, Bruce <italic>Henderson</italic> applied his degrees from <italic>Vanderbilt</italic> engineering and <italic>Harvard </italic>Business<italic> </italic>at <italic>Westinghouse</italic> to become VP. After President Eisenhower appointed him to assess foreign aid programs in Germany in 1953, Henderson joined <italic>Arthur Little</italic>. By 1963, the Boston Brahmin-led <italic>Boston Safe Deposit & Trust </italic>hired Henderson to start <italic>Boston Consulting Group </italic>(\u201cBCG\u201d) to advise bank clients. Although consulting had been \u2018static\u2019 dynamism emerged that year as Henderson introduced the \u2018growth-share\u2019 matrix. \nCongress restored the presidential authority to control speculative credit, but it went unused in the 1970s.  added reserve requirements for BHCs issuing CP. With the unreliability of bank loan financing, firms increasingly issued CP. Still, banks sold smaller and less well-known CP issuers stand-by lines of credit (\u201cSLCs\u201d), insuring them against <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic>-type rollover risk and reducing their funding cost. Congress also privatized <italic>Fannie Mae</italic>\u2014to market Federally underwritten residential mortgages\u2014and chartered <italic>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp</italic> (\u201c<italic>Freddie Mac</italic>\u201d) to create a secondary market for other residential mortgages. These agencies issued private mortgage-secured debt, which qualified as reserve-exempt collateral for repo loans that FRS used alongside UST bonds in monetary policy. Courts allowed creditors to sell the collateral without a bankruptcy stay. So, repos grew as secured, short-term financing. \nAfter TA1969 repealed investment trade credits,  resumed them and made tax-oriented leases tradable like NOCs, both subsidized lease financing by accelerating depreciation. Tax shelters incentivized corporations and financial investors to buy and lease. As credit dried up, industrials and retailers formed equipment lease trusts with tax passthrough partnerships using nonrecourse loans. Despite the growth of CP-financed leases, SEC failed to convince the <italic>Accounting Principles Board </italic>to set capitalizing standards since the 1960s. Firms feared that debt disclosures would increase financing costs. In the wake of <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic>\u2019s CP default, SEC replaced the <italic>Accounting Principles Board</italic> with the <italic>Financial Accounting Standards Board</italic> (\u201cFASB\u201d) in 1973 to control the corporate accounting. \nCP funded leases, and, from 1970, <italic>money market mutual funds</italic> (\u201cMMMFs\u201d) purchased CP. MMMFs offered liquid savings unconstrained by <italic>Reg Q</italic> and increasingly disintermediated banks. Moreover, FDIC deposit insurance caps incentivized businesses to invest into diversified MMMFs instead of taking on the risk that FDIC forces unsecured depositors haircuts of failed banks undiversified per FA1933. Likewise, <italic>Merrill</italic> combined MMMFs with a credit card and check writing privileges to innovate retail cash management in 1975.\nCP also funded garment licenses. Since American born Katz-cousin Ralph Lifshitz founded designer <italic>Ralph Lauren</italic> in 1967, he had to sell licenses to <italic>Kreisler</italic> to access funds. <italic>Kreisler</italic>, in turn, raised financing from his factor, <italic>Chase</italic>, which was expanding into the garment sector by advancing funds against factory guarantees. <italic>Kreisler</italic>\u2019s competitor <italic>Bidermann</italic> similarly bought licenses from <italic>Yves Saint Laurent</italic>, <italic>Calvin Klein</italic>, and others.\nMeanwhile, TA1969\u2019s capital gains tax and the rising inflation made stocks unattractive for high-bracket taxpayers. So they offset income taxes by investing in real estate and oil partnerships levered with nonrecourse debt and secured by the underlying assets. After taking America off the gold standard in 1971, Nixon created the<italic> Federal Energy Administration</italic> (\u201cFEA\u201d) to control consumer fuel prices temporarily. Months before the<italic> </italic>oil embargo of 1973, Congress extended these controls to all petroleum and taxed large oil refineries to finance nuclear energy. While consumers saw few price benefits, investment in new developments fell as imports increased. \nIn 1968, DOJ sued PUs for monopolizing wires. Months before the 1973 embargo, the Court ruled that PUs could not refuse cities from transmitting cheap federal PU power. The Court also empowered FPC to prevent PUs with antitrust violations from raising capital. As FPC hesitated rate hikes after OPEC\u2019s 1973 oil embargo, investment slowed, her pipe rate capes trapped Southwest gas. \nWhile the <italic>Civil Aeronautics Board</italic> protected truck and airline cartels and labor unions, ICC began allowing direct routes. Although prices fell in concentrated industries, FTC inflated prices by preventing mergers and enforcing AA1936\u2019s resale price maintenance. Over the next two years, the Court limited the scope of AA1914 and AA1936 to interstate <italic>commerce</italic>. So, Congress extended FTC\u2019s jurisdiction from industries operating<italic> </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>in commerce</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> </italic>to those \u201c<italic>in or affecting commerce,</italic>\u201d like cement.\nNon-energy shelters collapsed as the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic> deflated real estate. Partnerships had few alternatives to ceding collateral and repaying tax write-offs. Perhaps the most specular dissolution resulted from a death. As Alex DiLorenzo died in 1975, <italic>Goldman DiLorenzo</italic> dissolved, relinquishing approximately 40% of their properties, with <italic>Massachusetts</italic> <italic>Mutual</italic> LIC foreclosing <italic>Chrysler Building</italic>. Likewise, Sol Goldman faced significant indebtedness to <italic>Chase</italic> NB, prompting him to negotiate a repayment plan at 6% interest over 5 years. Adjusting strategies, Goldman ceased employing the equity-pledging technique, preferring direct loan requests from banks. Still, Goldman presided over possibly the largest real estate empire in New York City.\nThat year, the Court adopted <italic>Bankruptcy Commission</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> counsel to align partnership and corporate procedures. The new rules no longer required partnerships to surrender assets when filing BA1938\u2019s seldom-used <italic>Chapter XII</italic>. As courts allowed secured creditor cramdowns, bankruptcy filings exploded. Creditor seniority depended on technical requirements within loan participation litigation in cases where the lead bank failed. Despite the elevated inflation, FRS maintained stable rates to promote growth. \nAs CP-funded leases grew globally, Congress extended TA1971\u2019s lease provisions and increased investment tax credits with TA1975. Although  curbed tax shelters\u2019 use of nonrecourse debt, Congress exempted real estate and corporate leases through 1980 and elongated NOCs. Moreover, TA1976 increased capital gains taxes and inflation grew, taxpayers sought shelter, widening the deficit, and growing inflation. So, Congress began reversing inflationary <italic>New Deal</italic> protections to push rates towards the marginal cost. They first expanded rate flexibility to railroads in 1976 and reorganized the <italic>PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic> and other railroads into <italic>Conrail</italic>. Likewise, SEC pressured FASB to standardize lease reporting. Industrials and retailers suddenly reported more debt.  \nFor decades, the Federal government controlled most coal lands as LA1889 ceased sales and LA1920 regulated leases by market power. Under Johnson in 1968, DOJ sued to stop <italic>General</italic> <italic>Dynamics </italic>from<italic> </italic>vertically integrating coal. Likewise, Congressmen lobbied to stop <italic>Continental Oil</italic> from buying <italic>COALH</italic>. As DOJ sued to undo <italic>Kennecott</italic>\u2019s merger with <italic>Peabody</italic> coal, TVA rallied against cartels and sought to acquire the coal assets. By 1969, President Nixon replaced Johnson. Unlike his predecessors who relied heavily on business leaders such as Rockefeller or <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Meyer and Stanley Osborne, Nixon favored politicians in his appointments. Nixon appointed Kansas Congressman Robert Ellsworth as the Ambassador to NATO. \nAs <italic>Lazard</italic> funded Henry Crown\u2019s takeover of <italic>General</italic> <italic>Dynamics </italic>in 1970\u2014and installed Osborne on the board\u2014Rohatyn hired Ellsworth in 1971, and Meyer arranged him to serve on the boards of <italic>Fiat</italic> and <italic>General Dynamics</italic> before he returned to government in 1974. While the Court expanded FTC\u2019s authority in 1972, allowing consideration of broader public values in determining fairness, they sustained <italic>General</italic> <italic>Dynamics</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> merger in 1974, denying DOJ for the first time since 1959. However, she ordered <italic>Kennecott</italic> to divest under threat of LA1920 foreclosure. \nBy 1975, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris interests invested in their first major industrial investment in America mining.   Acquiring a 67% stake in American <italic>Copperweld</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> faced opposition from <italic>Copperweld</italic>\u2019s employees and management, resulting in protests and legal battles. Antisemitic sentiments fueled the opposition, with protests targeting Guy Rothschild personally. Despite the backlash, he defended the acquisition and ultimately secured full control of <italic>Copperweld</italic>.\nCA1970 also created the <italic>Environmental Protection Agency</italic> (\u201cEPA\u201d). As <italic>Southern Coal</italic> and New York PUs buckled during the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>, the Court supported EPA in forcing PUs to install coal scrubbers against pollution in 1976. While TA1976 shifted federal coal land lease revenue to states, CA1977 subsidized eastern high-sulfur coal with scrubber mandates. Still, CA1977\u2019s land reclamation mandate favored flat Western lands over Appalachia. \nAfter ending the federal nuclear monopoly in 1964, Congress extended tort liability caps in 1966 to 1987. As PUs ran to nuclear energy, oil inflation spread to uranium. <italic>T</italic><italic>hree Mile Island</italic>\u2014in coal-rich Pennsylvania\u2014and other private PUs issued SLC-backed CP using off-balance sheet lease trusts. Alongside TVA, FDR\u2019s <italic>Bonneville Power Admin </italic>(\u201cBPA\u201d) dammed the Columbia River for federal hydroelectricity in the Pacific Northwest. As BPA lobbied DOJ to dissolve <italic>ALUM</italic>, <italic>ALUM</italic> became BPA\u2019s first customer. In 1971, BPA anticipated inability to meet demand by 1983. \nBefore Congress gave BPA <italic>authority</italic> status in 1974, BPA led a municipal PU cooperative (\u201cWSPPS\u201d) to develop inter-state<italic> </italic>nuclear plants financed by record tax-exempt municipal debt. TA1975 added nuclear PU investment tax credits. Amidst PU runs to cheaper natural gas, Congress allowed FEA to force PUs to use coal. Following the anti-OIL sentiment of <italic>Watergate</italic>, TA1975 also replaced depletion allowance with cost depletion, with proportional depletion for independents. This happened after FPC exempted independents from gas limits in 1970 but the Court invalidated the preference in 1974. With international sharing programs, Congress created the federal <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserves</italic>. \nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>, DOJ litigation concerning director interlocks and anticompetitive practices surged since the Court allowed broader public values in determining fairness in 1972. Instead of secured credit, banks interlocked directorates like in Europe, which as DOJ investigated for AA1914. Fusing into FEA into DOE, Congress reorged FPC into the<italic> Federal Energy Regulatory Commission </italic>(\u201cFERC\u201d), which increased enforcement of PA1935 against financial interlocks with PUHCs. \nStill, between 1974 and 1976, <italic>Rochester Gas & Electric Corp</italic> directors secured two out of seven positions on FRS <italic>New York</italic>\u2019s Buffalo branch, including the Chair<italic> </italic>of<italic> Security New York State Corp</italic> and President of <italic>Rochester Institute of Technology</italic>. While FRS appointed <italic>Westinghouse</italic>\u2019s Chair as Class C director of FRS <italic>Cleveland</italic>, the latter appointed CEO of <italic>HJ Heinz</italic>, and a <italic>Westinghouse</italic> director, to the Pittsburgh branch. \nThe provost and trustee of <italic>Carnegie Mellon</italic> was appointed to the same branch. Florida\u2019s <italic>Southeast Banking Corp</italic> secured five positions on FRS <italic>Atlanta </italic>branches, including three of four in Miami. In Detroit, EVP of <italic>Chrysler</italic> joined FRS <italic>Chicago</italic>\u2019s Detroit branch, also serving as a director of <italic>American Natural Gas </italic>and its subsidiary, <italic>Michigan Consolidated Gas</italic>. The President of <italic>Michigan Consolidated Gas </italic>joined FRS <italic>Detroit</italic>\u2019s board, also serving as a director of <italic>American Natural Gas</italic>.\nAmidst the oil crisis, another power broker grew. Robert Strauss was born into a family of Jewish German immigrants in Texas. In 1945, he co-founded the energy-focused law firm<italic> </italic><italic>Akin Gump</italic>. Later, he became a top fundraiser for Johnson\u2019s presidential campaigns and was appointed treasurer for the <italic>Democratic National Committee</italic> (\u201cDNC\u201d) in 1970. Within a year, he established <italic>Akin</italic>\u2019s legislative practice in DC, which revolutionized the lobbying industry. In 1972, <italic>Akin</italic>\u2019s Strauss rose to DNC Chair and helped unify the party, playing a key role in electing James Carter as president in 1976. After stepping down from the DNC, Strauss served as Carter\u2019s special trade representative, Middle East negotiator, and anti-inflation adviser. \nCarter\u2019s other key donors included several <italic>Lehman</italic> executives (including Roger Altman, who was appointed the Assistant Secretary of UST for Domestic Finance), Lehman-in-law John Loeb of <italic>Loeb</italic>, <italic>Paine</italic> <italic>Webber</italic>\u2019s Sidney Brody, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Felix Rohatyn,<italic> Kidder</italic>\u2019s Paul Rogers, lawyer Joseph Flom, and Walter Rothschild, who was not related to the <italic>Rothschild</italic> family but a Warburg in-law.\nWhen Boston Brahmin-led <italic>Boston Safe Deposit & Trust </italic>controlled BCG, they sold strategy projects. Believing that consultants should partner with single companies for each industry for long-term implementation, rising star Bill Bain left in 1973 to start management consultancy <italic>Bain</italic>. Within a year, BCG became independent. Among the first to form an ESOP for a management LBO after the Congress enacted ERISA during the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>. As <italic>McKinsey</italic> faced increasing competition from BCG<italic> </italic>and<italic> Bain</italic> in 1975, banks made up only 3% of her revenues, primarily for organization and marketing projects. \nSince Sanford Weill\u2019s partner Cogan\u2014the \u2018C\u2019 in CBWL\u2014left to help LTV\u2019s Jimmy Ling run a smaller conglomerate, Weill tapped Cogan\u2019s assistant Peter Cohen as his new prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Soon after, Arthur Levitt\u2014the \u2018L\u2019 in CBWL\u2014left to become head of <italic>American Stock Exchange</italic>. Since joining CBWL and buying <italic>Hayden Stone</italic> during the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>, Frank Zarb briefly left to join the Nixon administration, he returned to <italic>Shearson Hayden</italic> until President Ford appointed him FEA\u2019s Energy Tsar. \nPierre Weill died in 1975, his son, Michel, took over <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. Although the partners had considered Disque Deane as Andr\u00e9\u2019s successor, Deane preferred to not share profits and soon spun-off. While Andr\u00e9 Meyer\u2019s son became a physicist, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Rohatyn liked deals and politics, and so refused to lead. So, Andr\u00e9 Meyer sold his <italic>Lazard</italic> New York shares to Weill and <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1977, before dying in 1979. \nWeill hired Zarb,<italic> Lehman</italic>\u2019s James Glanville and Ian MacGregor (formerly <italic>AMAX</italic>\u2019s CEO), and retiring FRS Chair Arthur Burns. Sanford Weill not only lost Zarb, but soon Peter Cohen to <italic>Safra</italic>. By 1979, Sanford\u2019s <italic>Shearson Hayden</italic> bought <italic>Loeb</italic>. The same year, Daniel Meinertzhagen retired as Chair of <italic>Lazard</italic> London and CEO Nigel Fraser gained that post.\nAndr\u00e9 Meyer\u2019s last hire, Swiss lawyer Mina Gerowin, became <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s first female manager. She left after harassment. Since the sexual discrimination agreement in 1974,<italic> Sullivan</italic> hired more female associates, but would not promote any to partner that decade. But other law firms made progress. After Brooksley Born joined <italic>Arnold Porter </italic>in 1968, she worked part-time until her children went to school and made partner by 1974.\nSince the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>, Israel devalued her <italic>shekel</italic>, hiked PU prices, and promoted exports. But while the Shah\u2019s educational and land reforms were successful while oil revenues grew until 1975 and <italic>Iranian Oil</italic> hired <italic>Chase</italic>. But while high oil prices helped the Shah of Iran\u2019s educational and land reforms, when prices began falling in 1975. By 1978, Israel traded Sinai oil fields with Egypt for peace to reopen the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> for the first time since 1967.\nAmidst an accident at <italic>Three Mile Island </italic>in 1978, investors ran from nuclear PUs. At the same time, protests led Iranian revolutionaries to replace pro-West Shah with anti-capitalist and -Israel theocrats, led by Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini and other descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, who nationalized banks\u2014including <italic>Narodny</italic> Tehran\u2014in June. After the Shah fled Iran, <italic>Chase </italic>NB\u2019s executives\u2014including David Rockefeller\u2014lobbied the Carter Administration to admit the Shah for cancer treatment, leading Iranian students  to seize America\u2019 Embassy in Tehran in November.\nAs American froze Iranian assets, <italic>Bank</italic> <italic>Melli</italic> London worked to maintain operations. Officials reported continuing business through alternative channels, partly guided by Tehran but making many local decisions, while expressing surprise that American banks like <italic>Chase </italic>blocked deposits and a <italic>Chase</italic>-led syndicate had foreclosed on a Shah-era loan. Staff managed customer withdrawals through other banks, keeping financial flows with the West active and minimizing political imagery in the office. \nDespite oil and credit inflation, the federal <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserves</italic> and international sharing programs established after the 1973 embargo were still too small. Since Israel traded Sinai oil fields, Iran\u2019s revolution led Israel to convert electricity to consume coal over oil. As Israel abolished subsidies, utilities charges quadrupled, but shortages grew. Ending FX controls and fixed exchange rates to buy Egyptian oil, Israel ended hyperinflation with the <italic>new shekel</italic>. \nAs FRS lost control of MMFR, they increased required reserves amidst the <italic>Panic of 1979</italic>. The mismatch squeezed depositories\u2014S&Ls limited to investing in long-dated mortgages and FRS-regulated banks subject to tighter<italic> Reg Q </italic>and reserves\u2014favored reserve-less MMMFs. While George Miller led<italic> Textron</italic>, Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter enlisted his aid to assist minorities and veterans. Miller left <italic>Textron</italic> in 1978 to lead FRS and then UST in 1979 when Paul Volcker replaced him at FRS. \nVolcker urged commercial and consumer lending instead of LBOs and speculators. The opposite happened as inflation grew. BA1938 and FA1933 had supported an era of entrenched management as creditors lost control over corporate governance. While SEC changed management during reorgs until 1953, Congress had since allowed corporations in cases without misconduct to forgo this stewardship for creditors\u2019 benefit. \nWhile Texas had mandated unit banking since 1876, multi-bank BHCs spread in Texas as BHCA1970 federalized them. Unlike Oklahoma, Texas allowed BHC acquisitions and so bank consolidation accelerated. While banks participated in loans with correspondents, they could not securitize loans per FA1933 and were limited geographically per BHCA1956. After graduating <italic>Harvard Business</italic> and working for <italic>State Street</italic>, Lowell Bryan joined<italic> McKinsey</italic>, and advised <italic>Chase</italic> to buy Texas and Oklahoma bank participations in 1976. \nOklahoma\u2019s PSB used repos to originate and distribute energy loans to <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Continental Illinois</italic>, <italic>Seattle First</italic>, and other NBs. More fortunate was the Eccles-dominated <italic>First Security</italic> BHC headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. As <italic>First Security</italic> BHC controlled a third of the banking resources of Utah, Wyoming, and Idaho, the bank thrived with the region\u2019s copper, oil, and natural gas boom.\nAs gas producers laid off employees during winter shortages in early 1977, President Carter called to deregulate gas. By 1978, FRS tightened credit to quell prices but allowed depositories to issue variable-rate notes to ease their asset-liability mismatch. While S&Ls adopted these, banks issued consumer repos. As FRS hiked reserve requirements for large CDs, UST stabilized the <italic>dollar</italic> with FX operations. FA1978 extended FA1966 to allow bank regulators to remove individual directors and required board reporting of insider loans. \nWith inflation unabated, Congress added price stability to FRS\u2019 mandate, decreased capital gains with , and enacted  to allow cramdowns (except for nonrecourse real estate shelter loans), the  to deregulate inter-state pipe quantity caps over multi-decade stages\u2014, and \u2014to expand the Court\u2019s 1973 ruling, de-monopolize PU wires, and foster independent and renewable energy. Since Congress organized <italic>Conrail</italic> in 1976, conditions deteriorated. After Congress allowed him to deregulate the <italic>Civil Aeronautics Board</italic>, Carter called for truck and coal railroad deregulation in 1979.\nBA1978 particularly affected unsecured credit cards. As James Robinson II became the head of Atlanta\u2019s <italic>First </italic>NB, the Southeast\u2019s largest bank, his son James Robinson III, parlayed his experience at <italic>Morgan </italic>to join <italic>American Express</italic> in 1970 and become President by 1977. Since 1865, when a Tennessee Unionist founded <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>, the inaugural NB of the former Confederacy. However, state regulations confined banks to city limits, leading to a proliferation of banks in Atlanta during the resurgence of Georgia in the early 20th century. \nWhile Colonel Robert Maddox cofounded a planters\u2019 warehouse using tobacco and cotton as collateral, they moved into banking with a private bank, <italic>Maddox</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Rucker</italic> in 1879, <italic>Citizens & Southern Bank, of Savannah</italic> and <italic>Lowry</italic> started in 1887 and 1888, and Captain James English a former Confederate captain of New Orleans became mayor and co-founded <italic>American Trust</italic> SB in 1880, becoming its president in 1890. In 1896, a Mississippian established <italic>Third</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>, prompting <italic>American Trust </italic>SB\u2019s transition to a federal charter, ultimately becoming <italic>Fourth</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Maddox</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Rucker</italic> became <italic>American</italic> NB in 1908.\nThe growth of <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic> coincided with <italic>Coca Cola</italic>\u2019s success, and WWI saw mergers emerge as an alternative growth strategy. In 1916, <italic>American</italic> NB merged into <italic>Atlanta</italic> NB, and in 1919, <italic>Citizens & Southern Bank of Savannah</italic> merged with <italic>Third</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>, forming <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic> NB (distinct from the Black-owned bank in Philadelphia). By 1923, <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic> merged with <italic>Lowry</italic> NB, followed by a merger with <italic>Atlanta</italic> NB a year later. \nIn 1929, <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic> NB extended a loan to and acquired <italic>Atlanta Trust Co</italic>. The same year, <italic>Coca Cola</italic> reportedly guided <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic>\u2019s merger with <italic>Fourth</italic> NB into <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>, creating the Southeast\u2019s largest NB, and acquired <italic>Atlanta Savings Bank</italic> by 1930. With FA1933 separating <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic> from <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic> in 1933. As Woodruffs directed <italic>Coca Cola</italic> and <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic>, generations of Robinsons (James English\u2019s son-in-law and grandson) and Maddoxes led <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>.\nAfter <italic>Sears</italic> established <italic>Allstate Insurance</italic> to sell auto insurance by direct mail in 1931, they expanded into consumer cards. Like before, BA1978 excepted banks and S&Ls from bankruptcy and allowed lenders to setoff mutual debts. But BA1978 reduced creditor rights for a \u2018fresh start.\u2019 So, as consumer bankruptcies skyrocketed, <italic>Sears</italic> and other unsecured creditors lobbied Congress. <italic>Sears</italic> also hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> partner Philip Purcell to grow consumer finance. \nWith lower preferences, factor advances and CP\u2014without bank SLCs\u2014became shorter and more expensive. As a result, sales of secured durables plummeted\u2014particularly of CP-financed autos sensitive to oil prices\u2014requiring UST to bail out <italic>Chrysler</italic>. (Assistant Secretary of UST for Domestic Finance Roger Altman negotiated the bailout of <italic>Chrysler</italic> with <italic>Salomon</italic> and became <italic>Chrysler</italic>\u2019s banker after returning to <italic>Lehman</italic>.) Similarly, <italic>Kreisler</italic>, which use <italic>Ralph Lauren</italic> licenses to guarantee factor loans from <italic>Chase</italic>. As <italic>Kreisler</italic> filed for bankruptcy, <italic>Chase</italic> funded <italic>Ralph Lauren</italic> until <italic>Bidermann</italic> bought their license.\nAs BA1978 de-prioritized CP, banks refocused on leases, secured and LBO loans, and tax shelters insulated against BA1978\u2019s cramdowns. Consumer debt was riskier than longer-term speculation. By allowing solvent firms to trigger automatic stays and cram-downs of secured creditors, BA1978 made bankruptcy attractive to debtors and unsecured creditors. Like banks, brokers were exempt from bankruptcy. While BA1978 subjected insured stockbrokers to SIPA liquidations, uninsured commodity brokers segregated investor accounts. So BA1978 granted them the only commercial exemption from bankruptcy stays, for investors to focus on asset risk without broker risk.\nUsing straddles to offset commodity futures allowed investors to realize tax losses and keep the gains. So, banks invested into energy. Having fled Nazi Belgium for America, Marc Rich had made a global oil spot market at <italic>Philipp</italic>, owned by <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> <italic>Lazard</italic>-banked <italic>MINERAL</italic>. By 1974,<italic> </italic>he started his own firm, <italic>Rich</italic>, with bank SLCs financing from <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and others. Investigating <italic>DeBeers</italic> for antitrust since the 1940s, DOJ switched to <italic>MINERAL </italic>before admitting defeat in 1976. Like <italic>Philipp</italic>, <italic>Cargill</italic> dominated trade after moving to Switzerland in the 1950s, focusing on grain. When TA1976 taxed income earned from controlled overseas subsidiaries, <italic>Cargill</italic> sold half her Swiss interest. \nThere was also a significant increase of new Asian banks in California. <italic>Korea Exchange Bank</italic> (\u201cKEB\u201d) of Los Angeles funded by the Korean government to promote small business, faced financial difficulties when many Korean borrowers failed to repay their loans. The crisis began in 1972 when around a hundred Korean nationals were unable to repay their loans, resulting in the arrest of KEB\u2019s general manager in Seoul. KEB\u2019s lenient terms under pressure from the Korean government contributed to the crisis. \nThe rapid expansion of Asian banks concerned American banks, prompting Congress to impose restrictions on new bank entry criteria in 1977. The crisis highlighted the need for KEB to tighten its lending practices and recover unpaid loans. Measures were taken to collect past-due principal, and by 1978, only 20 debtors with a total of $50,000 in unpaid principal remained. KEB aimed to improve its operations in the California market while assisting Korean nationals. By 1980, British Asia-focused bank HSBC acquired 51% of New York\u2019s <italic>Marine Midland</italic> BHC.\nAs foreign banks grew in America after <italic>Bretton Woods</italic>, FRS requested power over foreign banks in 1975. BCCI could not enter as New York\u2019s bank regulator Muriel Siebert and SEC blocked BCCI\u2019s hostile takeover of an American BHC in 1978. FA1978 granted FRS foreign purchase approval powers, but not to close banks. Abedi grew in America by \u2018befriending\u2019 President Carter and hiring a former defense, budget, and other senior officials. By the 1980s, BCCI had banks in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Knoxville, Miami, New York, and DC. \nPer FA1978,<italic> Bank of America</italic> sold her BCCI shares due to management concerns and fast growth. But Pharaon raised Persian Gulf financing for BCCI, which transferred control to Cayman Islands-domiciled charities. As the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, BCCI channeled Gulf and CIA funds there and Pakistan\u2019s nuclear arms. \nAfter decontrolling oil over two years in 1979, Congress considered complex WWII-era excise taxes on oil profits before implementing windfall profit taxes per IRS and DOJ in 1980. As oil firms merged in response to the windfall tax, profitable corporations sheltered in coal equipment leases. <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>profits doubled<italic> </italic>in the merger boom. \nInflation also spurred speculation in derivatives. Since the <italic>Commodity Exchange Act of 1936</italic> only regulated derivatives on domestic agriculture, Congress amended the act in 1974 to require that futures and options contracts on virtually all commodities, including financial instruments, trade on a regulated exchange, and created a new federal independent agency, <italic>Commodity Futures Trading Commission </italic>(\u201cCFTC\u201d), to regulate and supervise the market. \nSince H. L. Hunt died in 1974, CFTC investigated his sons after a 1977 soy corner. As dollars inflated after the Soviet invasion, <italic>Hunt</italic> bought 10% of <italic>Bache</italic>, which brokered oil and silver collateral bank loans for <italic>Hunt</italic> to buy silver\u2014with tax-free interest and storage\u2014from <italic>MINERAL</italic>\u2019s<italic> Philipp</italic>. Robert Abboud, a Lebanese-American, provided half of <italic>Bache</italic>\u2019s loans via <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>. As Chair of <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Chicago</italic>, Abboud, closely affiliated with Gaith Pharaon secured the loans for <italic>Bache</italic>. <italic>First</italic> was the largest lender for <italic>Bache</italic>, providing $75 million in loans, and Abboud enlisted several other banks, including Pharaon\u2019s banks, to secure a total of $233 million. \nAt the time, one of <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Chicago</italic>\u2019s leaders was Homer Livingston Jr. His father had joined the bank in the 1920s, became President in 1950, and Chair in 1960 alongside directorships in <italic>Continental Assurance</italic>, <italic>Inland Steel</italic>, <italic>Armour</italic>, <italic>OIL of Indiana</italic>, <italic>Sears</italic>, and <italic>Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville</italic> RR. The younger Livingston joined in 1962. He became VP in 1969 and led the bank\u2019s London branch from 1971 to 1973. In 1974, he became SVP for corporate banking. After a dispute with Abboud, he left the bank in 1979 to lead <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic> Chicago but joined <italic>William Blair</italic> in 1982 to oversee commercial bank investment banking.\nAs the sole 1969 authority use, Carter directed FRS to restrict speculative bank credit. Facing margin calls, <italic>Hunt</italic> defaulted, leading <italic>Bache</italic> to cover calls by fire selling silver collateral. Per SEC \u201c<italic>For six days late in March 1980 it appeared to government officials, Wall Street, and the public at large that a default by a single family on its obligations in the plummeting silver market might seriously disrupt the US financial system</italic>.\u201d Combining long-term capital gains with short-term losses, <italic>Hunt</italic> reorged outside of court by selling oil land to <italic>MINERAL</italic>, which bought <italic>Salomon</italic>. As small commodity brokers failed in 1980, big brokers sought open contract stay exemptions. As brokers failures peaked since 1974, brokers sought exemptions for security contracts. While <italic>Arnold Porter</italic> partner Brooksley Born represented <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic> and settled, <italic>Shank Irwin</italic>, a small Texas law firm, represented the Hunts went to trial. With problematic evidence, a court found <italic>Hunt</italic> price fixed against AA1890, forcing them to file for bankruptcy. \nAbboud helped another big customer, Hammer, came out as a big winner by shorting silver to hedge <italic>Occidental</italic>\u2019s silver mines. While Hammer failed to develop Azeri gas, he included <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Karr\u2014before he died in 1979\u2014in distributing commemorative coins minted in 1978 for the 1980 Moscow <italic>Olympics</italic>, despite the international boycott of the games as <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Narodny</italic> Paris co-managed a loan to <italic>Vneshtorg</italic>. The Los Angeles <italic>Olympics</italic> also selected <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and <italic>Occidental</italic> to market coins outside of America in 1984. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> transformed. Although the founding families had remained on <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s board for generations into the 1960s, this changed with the global role of the bank and country. After investing in <italic>White Weld</italic> Zurich in 1962, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> led MMEU bond issuance. And with the emergence of a free gold market, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> bought <italic>Valcambi</italic> refinery and led gold trading from 1968. \nLikewise, <italic>White Weld</italic>\u2019s Stanislas Yassukovich brought in Michael Clemm from <italic>Citi</italic> London and John Craven. Born in England in 1940, Craven began his career as an accountant with <italic>Wood Gundy</italic> in Canada and joined <italic>Warburg</italic> London in 1967, becoming a director focused on MMEU bond issuance in 1969. When <italic>Credit Suisse </italic>increased her stake in <italic>White Weld</italic>\u2019s European operations in 1974, Craven succeeded Yassukovich as President of <italic>Credit Suisse White Weld</italic>, while Clemm served as a Senior Director.\nWhen <italic>Merrill Lynch</italic> acquired <italic>White Weld</italic> in 1978, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> sought a new American partner. Craven and Yassukovich opposed a merger with <italic>First Boston</italic>, preferring <italic>Dillon</italic>, but Clemm negotiated directly with <italic>First Boston</italic>, leading to the creation of <italic>Credit Suisse First Boston</italic><italic> </italic>(\u201cCSFB\u201d). The deal prompted the resignations of Craven and Yassukovich, and Clemm assumed leadership of the new firm as Chair of CSFB Europe, while Rainer Gut, then Deputy Chair of <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>, became Chair for CSFB.\nBorn in Switzerland to a Catholic <italic>Zuger Kantonalbank</italic> executive in 1932, Rainer Gut became general partner at <italic>Lazard</italic> New York from 1968 to 1971 and Chair and CEO of <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s American operations, <italic>Swiss American Corp</italic> in New York, from 1971 to 1973, after which he joined the board of <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>. In 1977, a fraudulent banking and FX trading scheme scandal in <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s Chiasso branch led to the resignation of top executives, elevating Gut to second in control. \nBy then, <italic>Cravath</italic> lawyer Bruce Wasserstein left to join Joseph Perella, the son of an Italian immigrant, at <italic>First Boston</italic> in 1976. By 1978, <italic>First Boston</italic> and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> swapped shares to build up the latter\u2019s <italic>Swiss American </italic><italic>Corp</italic> investment bank into CSFB. Likewise, <italic>White Weld</italic>\u2019s Research Analyst Jerome Kenney helped developed <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s capital markets capabilities to transform from a retail brokerage into a rival of <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>.\nAfter FRS\u2019 notice, banks moderately contracted business loans, but consumer loans collapsed. Erasing S&Ls\u2019 FA1966 regulation advantage over banks,  abolished <italic>Reg Q</italic> for banks, required S&Ls reserves, and allowed S&L to sell retail repos. After receiving advice from a team of advisors that included <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Zarb, Congress deregulated <italic>Conrail</italic>, deregulated trucking and coal road rates with IA1980, but promoting western coal with CA1977. As Congress taxed oil windfall profits to subsidize liquid coal tax credits, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Rohatyn failed to buy <italic>Continental Oil</italic>-<italic>COALH </italic>for<italic> Seagram</italic>. Instead of <italic>Lazard</italic>-style relationships, Wasserstein\u2019s legal strategy informed <italic>DuPont</italic>\u2019s lesser bid in a tactic SEC later outlawed. In 1980, <italic>Rockefeller</italic> bought <italic>Wessely Energy</italic>. \nStill, President Carter supported the unions that elected him. Since the Democratic Party shifting primary voting to mass participation in 1968, Carter won with support from the decentralized teacher voting bloc, particularly <italic>National Education Association</italic> (\u201cNEA\u201d). As President, Carter strengthened the NEA\u2019s influence by elevating education policy to a cabinet-level priority in the <italic>Department of Education</italic>.\nBuoyed by oil prices, the Republican party strategy had changed in the 1970s. In the early 1970s, several Republican staffers established <italic>Heritage Foundation</italic> to promote conservative policymaking against the dominance of <italic>Brookings</italic> and other liberal-leaning think tanks. While beer heir Joseph Coors supported the <italic>Heritage Foundation</italic>, <italic>Mellon</italic> oil and banking heir Richard Mellon Scaife funded the <italic>American Enterprise Institute</italic>. \nFeeling that conservative think tanks did not represent libertarian ideas, the <italic>Cato</italic> <italic>Institute</italic> was founded in the mid-1970s backed by oil and gas magnates <italic>Koch</italic>. Charles Koch viewed these institutes as pivotal in influencing policy as part of a broader strategy for societal change. When David Koch unsuccessfully ran for the Libertarian Party in 1980, he called to end the prosecution of tax evaders  \nDespite brief Black evangelical interest in the Republican Party, religion and race soon separated the parties. As Vietnam War protests and countercultural movements, established norms faced political challenges. As rates of single mothers greatly increased, Thomas Sowell and other economists blamed Lyndon Johnson\u2019s <italic>Great Society </italic>for fostering out-of-wedlock births and Black dependency on federal grants. \nAnd after the Court legalized abortion in 1973, TA1976 extended TA1954\u2019s childcare tax credits. As conservative sentiment grew, the emergence of a politically active evangelical force reshaped the Republican Party around moral issues like anti-communism and advocating for traditional family values and school prayer, evangelicals departed from historical anti-Catholic sentiments and advocacy for Black causes to ally with Republicans. \nIn 1980, Texan oil interests aligned with Republicans against Democrats who favored coal. George Herbert Walker Bush, known as Bush Sr, hailed from a political family; his father was Connecticut Senator Prescott Bush, and his mother, Dorothy, was the daughter of George Herbert Walker, who had been Prescott\u2019s boss at <italic>Brown Harriman</italic>. Bush Sr began his career in the Texas oil industry in 1948 and later served as a representative for the wealthy Houston district in Congress from 1967 to 1971. He rose through the ranks of the Republican Party under President Nixon and then directed CIA from 1976 before setting his sights on the presidency.\nHowever, Bush Sr was not the only contender for the Republican nomination. Ronald Reagan, who had started his career as an actor in 1937, served as the president of the <italic>Screen Actors Guild</italic> labor union for six terms. He fought against organized crime and Marxist influence in Hollywood, disclosing names to FBI in secret. Reagan later became the host of GE<italic> Theater</italic>, where he improved employee morale and warned against government control. \nHe switched his party affiliation to the Republicans in 1962 and endorsed Barry Goldwater for president, using television to raise campaign funds. Reagan eventually won California\u2019s gubernatorial race and served two terms.  As Reagan won the Republican primary against Bush Sr and former Texas governor John Connally, the former became Reagan\u2019s running mate, while the latter traveled to the Middle East to undermine President Carter\u2019s reelection, allegedly urging Iran to hold American hostages for the election. The tactic succeeded, and Reagan-Bush won the election. Bush Sr served as Reagan\u2019s VP both terms throughout the 1980s.\nHaving led <italic>Merrill</italic> over her national and product diversification and expansion since 1968, Don Regan fundraised for Reagan\u2019s campaign, and was rewarded with the UST Secretary post. Supporting the President\u2019s desire to deregulate the economy, Regan\u2019s tax reform sought to remove inequities, plug loopholes, and lower rates for individual taxpayers with fewer shelters to drive investment and employment. While he drove tax legislation from TA1981 through TA1986 (until Reagan replaced him after the <italic>Iran-Contra</italic> scandal), the influence of the Religious Right led TA1981 to reduce aid to single mothers.  Another financier of the Reagan Administration was William Draper III, who left his VC firms to become Chair of EXIM and CEO of UN\u2019s <italic>Development Program</italic>..\nAs Iraq invaded Iran and <italic>Strategic Petroleum</italic> <italic>Reserves</italic> remained small, and oil prices jumped. While Reagan accelerated oil decontrol but rejected Carter\u2019s liquid coal. As lease trusts protested equalization of partnership-corporate taxes,  accelerated TA1971\u2019s depreciation to offset inflation with leases and eased tax benefit sales to disincentivize mergers. While TA1981 ended commodity straddles and most shelters, non-debt tax shields favored real estate over oil by increasing cash flow. Since TA1976 barred non-real estate partnership shelters from nonrecourse debt, taxable investors and banks ran to commercial and real estate leases. \nStill, oil and gas shelters boomed as TA1981 allowed partnerships, like <italic>Mesa</italic> LP\u2014owned by Boone Pickens, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and John Calhoun\u2019s brother\u2014to pass through operating losses and deduct drilling and depletion. As <italic>Goldman</italic> bought a coffee trader and expanded into gold, non-brokers bought brokers. <italic>Prudential Insurance</italic> bought <italic>Bache</italic>,<italic> Sears</italic>\u2019 Purcell bought <italic>Coldwell</italic> real estate and <italic>Dean Witter Reynolds </italic>brokers. \nLikewise, privately-owned construction and engineering firm <italic>Bechtel </italic>bought significant stakes in <italic>Peabody Coal</italic> and <italic>Dillon</italic>. Since the Rothschilds took control of <italic>New Court Securities</italic> and removed him, John Birkelund became President of <italic>Dillon</italic>, succeeding Nicholas Brady, who became Chair. Birkelund\u2019s brother-in-law Christopher Smiles became the American representative of <italic>Trans-Arabian Investment Bank</italic> as hundreds of Middle Eastern offices grew in America.\nAs TA1981 spurred CP issuance, FRS deemed CP non-securities for banks as leases depended on CP, but courts supported brokers, limiting banks per FA1933. The same year, Sanford Weill led <italic>Shearson Hayden</italic> in a takeover of money manager <italic>Boston Co</italic>. Despite banks\u2019 protest of FA1933 violations, some saw it as a way to increase their chances of gaining permissions denied by FA1933, and <italic>Shearson Hayden</italic> retained <italic>Boston Co</italic>, along with B<italic>oston Safe Deposit & Trus</italic>t, America\u2019s largest nonbank. \nSo, Sanford sold <italic>Shearson</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic> to Robinson\u2019s <italic>American Express</italic>, with Weill becoming president under Robinson\u2014leaving his lieutenant Peter Cohen to run <italic>Shearson</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic>\u2014and soon acquiring Atlanta-broker <italic>Robinson Humphrey</italic>, securities firm <italic>Foster Marshall</italic>, and America\u2019s largest real estate syndicator, <italic>Balcor</italic>. Peter Cohen soon arranged his old boss, Safra, to sell the gold-focused <italic>Trade Development Bank of Switzerland</italic> to <italic>American Express Shearson</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic>. \nCubans also had historic year in 1981. After Fidel Castro led a Marxist revolution in Cuba in 1959, Carlos Arboleya fled to America. Born in Cuba in 1929, Arboleya started at <italic>Citi</italic> Havana and served as a manager from 1946 until joining <italic>Trust Co of Cuba</italic> as assistant manager in 1957, and then <italic>Banco Continental Cubano</italic> as Chief Auditor in 1959. Moving to Miami, Arboleya joined <italic>Allure Shoe Corp</italic> in 1960 and then <italic>Boulevard</italic> NB in 1962. \nAfter <italic>Fidelity</italic> NB of Miami hired him as EVP and Cashier in 1966, Arboleya became co-owner, President, and director of <italic>Flagler Bank</italic> from 1973. Selling <italic>Flagler </italic>to <italic>Barnett Bank</italic> of Miami in 1977, Arboleya became President and COO until <italic>Bank of America</italic> bought <italic>Barnett</italic> in 1981. Arboleye remained Vice Chair and COO of <italic>Bank of America</italic> until retiring in 1994. \nFellow Cuban exile, Roberto Goizueta also fled to Miami. A Basque-descendant and <italic>Yale</italic> educated sugar heir joined <italic>Coca Cola</italic>, and oversaw Caribbean bottling plants. By 1981, Goizueta became <italic>Coca Cola</italic>\u2019s CEO, soon buying <italic>Columbia Pictures</italic> from <italic>Allen</italic> and introducing <italic>Diet Coke</italic>. Goizueta remained the sole Hispanic CEO of a <italic>Fortune 500</italic> company for over a decade. (While Robert Woodruff stepped down of President of <italic>Coca Cola</italic> in the 1950s, he remained Chair until his death in 1984. The Woodruff-affiliated <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic> remained a large <italic>Coca Cola</italic> shareholder.)\nOther banks ran to foreign investors. Starting in the late 1970s, Saudi Arabian <italic>Olayan</italic>\u2019s portfolio grew to include banks\u2014about 1% stakes in <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Mellon Bank</italic> of Pittsburgh, <italic>Southeast Bancorp</italic> of Miami, <italic>Valley National</italic> of Phoenix, <italic>First Bank</italic> of Minneapolis, <italic>National City Bank</italic> of Cleveland, and <italic>Western Bancorp</italic> and <italic>Hawaii Bancorp</italic> of Honolulu\u2014and industrials like <italic>Thermo Electron Corp and Whittaker Corp</italic>. \nAfter<italic> </italic>increasing ownership in <italic>First Chicago Corp</italic> to over 7% in 1980, <italic>Olayan</italic> acquired 14% of <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic>, growing it soon to 24%. And <italic>Smith Barney</italic> sold a 25% stake to a Middle Eastern consortium by 1982. As several of Middle Easterners joined <italic>Smith Barney</italic>\u2019s board, they urged expansion and risk taking, and the bank entered the government-securities market for the first time.\nAlso in 1982, Head of <italic>Chase</italic> David Rockefeller retired to become Chair of <italic>Rockefeller</italic> with a goal of spreading its investments to the 90 of the 5th-generation descendants of <italic>OIL</italic> founder John Rockefeller. Like management shifted, so did investments per<italic> McKinsey</italic>. While Oklahoma\u2019s PSB used repos to originate and distribute energy loans to <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Continental Illinois</italic>, <italic>Seattle First</italic>, and other NBs per <italic>McKinsey</italic>, BA1978 had deprioritized setoffs. So as,<italic> </italic>increased risk shrank repo liquidity. Despite FRS\u2019 pleas to bailout PSB, FDIC\u2014worried about contingent liabilities\u2014allowed PSB to fail and prevented loan participation offsets. Despite PSB\u2019s heavy SLCs, that market did not blip. \nBy 1982, <italic>S&Ls</italic>\u2019 regulator began regulating retail repos. Unlike retail depositors, nonfinancial businesses were not freed from <italic>Reg Q</italic> and remained dependent on repos. This demand combined with UST and agency bond futures changes. TA1981\u2019s straddle controls created arbitrage opportunities as these futures exploded to hedge interest risk. As a result, <italic>Drysdale</italic> and other securities firms arbitraged UST debt repos. With cash tight, FRS acted to expand securities lending collateral and settlement from cash to include UST and federal agency debt and bank SLCs. However, stockbrokers\u2019 insurance would not cover such loans. Since SIPA of 1970 exempted brokers dealing UST securities, insurance and liquidation did not exist for brokers like <italic>Drysdale</italic>. By mid-1982, <italic>Drysdale</italic> defaulted. Her banker, <italic>Chase</italic>, passed the loss to clients, starting a run from repo. \nAs banks became uncertain about participations, creditors ran from energy projects across Oklahoma and Texas and loan participants, with <italic>McKinsey</italic> clients suffering disproportionally. <italic>Continental Illinois</italic> experiencing the first loss since the <italic>Great Depression</italic> in 1982. Retiring as CEO of <italic>Wells Fargo </italic>in late 1982, former <italic>McDonnell</italic>-in-law Richard Cooley became Chair, President, and CEO of <italic>Seattle First</italic>, and engineered a takeover by <italic>Bank of America</italic>. \nWhile allowing dozens of connected Kentucky and Tennessee banks to shutter, FDIC bailed out the \u2018too-big-to-fail\u2019 <italic>Continental Illinois</italic> by 1984. During the <italic>Continental</italic> rescue, FRS Chair Volcker criticized <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s involvement in banking, citing signs such as rapid expansion, extravagant office moves, and their engagement for senior officer compensation studies. Although <italic>Chase</italic> survived, she remained mired in lawsuits for years.\nAmidst the crisis, investors ran from American banks to Europe and Japan. International debts further troubled bank lending. While participating in Mexico\u2019s debt restructuring,<italic> Citi</italic> was sued by <italic>Michigan</italic> NB over a disputed <italic>Pemex</italic> state oil loan. To avoid a Paris Club precedent, Mexico rescheduled her debt through OECD in 1983. \nAfter <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Rodney Wagner arranged a bond issue to refinance Mexican debt in 1984, UST Secretary James Baker adopted the process to support restructuring through increased <italic>BANK</italic> lending. Still, banks needed alternatives to concentrated loans. Growing revenues by 20% and headcount by 10% annually since 1980, <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s bank clients accounted for 25 and 30% in New York and London revenues by 1983 as she helped <italic>Chase</italic> and <italic>Citi</italic> switch from bank participations to loan securitizations. \nWhile Congress amended BA1978 to exempt securities contracts from the automatic stay in July per the 1980 debate, the exemption did not include repos. But repo doubt grew. First, FDIC decided that retail repo lenders did not have priority over general creditors of a failed bank. Like with <italic>Drysdale</italic>, <italic>Chase</italic> was among <italic>Lombard</italic>\u2019s largest creditors with SLCs. \nAnd, the judge in <italic>Lombard</italic>\u2019s bankruptcy\u2014despite submissions from FRS and banks\u2014ruled that repo creditors were subject to automatic stays. As the run from institutional and retail repo investments squeezed S&Ls, FRS eased reserves, and Congress passed . DA1982 allowed S&Ls to make nonrecourse loans and issue MMMF-type products, ending the run. FRS then eliminated <italic>Reg Q</italic> for long-term business CDs. \nSince TA1981 spurred individual and corporate lease tax shelters, Congress de-monetized leases with . To support leases, UST abandoned equalization of corporate and partnership tax rates. Although TA1981\u2019s depreciation schedules aided PUs, anti-nuclear pressure led to write-downs. As TVA and other PUs cancelled more plants than existed, California and Washington rate-payer revolts spread to Tennessee and other states. Without Washington\u2019s state Court relief, WSPPS defaulted. As <italic>Berkshire </italic>bought WSPPS debt, BPA bought WSPPS. And Congress lapsed extending nuclear tort liability caps past 1987. \nSince the 1950s, Jewish law firms grew twice as fast as the old Protestant firms. In the 1970s, Jewish attorneys excelled in specific areas of law, contributing to the growth of Jewish law firms. Their success elevated the reputation of their firms. For example, Milton Handler\u2019s expertise in takeover law helped build <italic>Kaye Scholer</italic>. Ira Millstein had a similar impact on <italic>Weill Gotshal</italic>. Martin Lipton and Joseph Flom became renowned anti-takeover lawyers, establishing <italic>Wachtell Lipton Rosen Katz</italic> (of unknown connection to other Katz) and <italic>Skadden Arps</italic> as elite firms. \nJules Berman achieved similar success in real estate at <italic>Kaye Scholer</italic>. By 1980, four out of ten elite law firms were started by Jews. Although Indian corporations used \u2018poison pills\u2019 to thwart takeovers by 1929, <italic>Wachtell</italic> perfected the process from 1982. Lipton and Flom wrote so many takeover laws that corporations retained them as insurance. With growing legal complexity and specialization, monogamous banks and law firms\u2014like <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> with <italic>Davis Polk</italic>\u2014began opening their relationships.\nIn 1977, New York\u2019s governor named stockbroker Muriel Siebert the state\u2019s first female bank supervisor. The same year, President, Carter followed Nixon\u2019s first appointment of a non-White woman Treasurer in 1971 by naming Azie Morton in 1977 as the first Black. Born in Texas, she faced racial discrimination when she was denied admission to the <italic>Uni of Texas</italic>. \nDespite this setback, Morton worked for the new Texas AFL-CIO in 1957 and later served on President Kennedy\u2019s Committee on <italic>Equal Employment Opportunity</italic>. Morton continued her public service by serving on various foreign affairs committees, including representing America in Africa. Carter also named one-time <italic>Sullivan</italic> associate Barbara Lindemann as head of <italic>Agricultural Marketing Service</italic>. \nBy 1978, Carter appointed Nancy Teeters as the first female FRS Governor. Prior to her appointment, she had worked as a staff economist at FRS from 1957 to 1974, after which she served as the Chief Economist for the <italic>House Budget Committee</italic>. Within a year, he appointed Emmett Rice to FRS\u2019 Board, as the second Black Governor since Andrew Brimmer, where he served until 1986. Born to a Methodist minister in South Carolina, Rice earned his bachelor\u2019s and MBA from <italic>City College of New York</italic> by 1942. \nAfter serving as a Tuskegee Airman in WWII, he received a Fulbright Fellowship to study economic development in India, which became the basis for his doctoral dissertation at <italic>Berkeley</italic>. Rice taught at <italic>Berkeley</italic> and <italic>Cornell</italic> before joining FRS <italic>New York</italic> as an economist in 1960. In 1962, he helped establish <italic>Central Bank </italic><italic>of Nigeria</italic>. After 1964, he joined UST\u2019s Office of Developing Nations, America\u2019s alternate director at BANK, SVP at <italic>NB of Washington</italic>.\nSince Nixon\u2019s female Court justice appointees were deemed unqualified, Ford efforts ended similarly after Nixon resigned. Carter took a different approach, appointing ten women to the federal Courts of Appeals and 31 to District Courts by the summer of 1980. Prior to Carter, only eight women had served on federal district or appellate courts. Although President Reagan defeated Carter in the 1980 election, he appointed one of the newly elected female judges, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, to the Court in 1981. After Congress confirmed her nomination, O\u2019Connor became the first female justice to serve on the Court. \nAs most big New York promoted female partners by 1980,<italic> Sullivan</italic> fell into the minority despite her sexual discrimination agreement in 1974. Only in 1982 did <italic>Sullivan</italic><italic> </italic>promote Margaret Pfeiffer. After appointing Susan Phillips as the first woman to CFTC in 1981, Reagan promoted her to Chair two years later, turning the post into a women\u2019s chair for almost two decades. Also in 1983, he appointed the second female and first Latina to the <italic>National Labor Relations Board</italic>, New Mexico-born Patricia Diaz, after she represented <italic>Pacific Lighting</italic> management in labor disputes<italic> Paul Hastings</italic>, to battle union power.\nBy 1982, President Regan appointed Karen Horn as the first female President of a District FRS, FRS <italic>Cleveland</italic>. The <italic>Johns Hopkins Uni</italic> graduate had held positions at <italic>Bell </italic>Pennsylvania and as a FRS senior economist. While she joined Nancy Teeters on FRS\u2019 FOMC Committee as the second woman, Teeters departed FRS in 1984 for senior roles at IBM and other firms. Following Teeters, Martha Seger occupied the female FRS governor seat until another woman replaced her in 1991.\nThe progress in America mirrored that of Britain. \nAnne Warburton\u2014related to the Pearsons through her cousin twice removed Augusta Spencer-Churchill\u2014worked at the Economic Co-operation Administration, London and NATO Secretariat, Paris before joining <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1955. After two years, she joined the Foreign Office in 1957, and\u2014three years after the marriage ban on female diplomats was lifted\u2014became Ambassador to Denmark in 1976, the first British woman to hold an ambassadorial post. Three years later, Britain elected opposition leader Margert Thatcher as the first female PM<italic>.</italic>\nWomen also became leaders in capital markets. Since Patricia Douglas joined <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1976, she later became one of <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s first female partners, running the CP department. By then, Carol Brock transitioned from FRS <italic>New York</italic> to be an economist at <italic>Loeb</italic>. While she became Chief Economist of <italic>Shearson American Express Shearson</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic> by 1982, her husband, Jerome Kenney, from a similarly humble background, became President of <italic>Merrill</italic> Capital Markets shortly after. \nThe daughter of a working-class Puerto Rican immigrant, Christina Seix earned a BA in Mathematics from <italic>Fordham Uni</italic> in 1972 and MA in Mathematics at the <italic>State Uni of New York at Stony Brook</italic> a year later. Beginning her career with an entry-level position at a New York LIC, Christina joined <italic>MacKay-Shields </italic>in 1981, initially as the sole member of their bond department. Under her leadership, the firm shifted its focus to bond investing in the early 1980s. After Christina became Chair and CEO of <italic>MacKay-Shields</italic>, she sold to <italic>New York </italic>LIC<italic> </italic>In 1986. After joining <italic>Freddie Mac</italic> and founding <italic>Seix</italic> in 1989, Christina sold <italic>Seix</italic> to Atlanta\u2019s <italic>SunTrust </italic>in 2004.\nWith James King, the first Jewish partner, becoming Managing Partner of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Protestant big law firm, <italic>Davis Polk</italic>, the firm had 8 female partners, while <italic>Sullivan</italic> had 4, and Cravath had 2 by 1987. None were Black. Since <italic>McKinsey</italic> promoted the first female principal in 1979, she left. To start her own consultancy. By 1986, five of <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s 230 partners were women, but none were Black. While Bob Holland was promoted to principal in 1974, he left to run <italic>Ben & Jerrys</italic> in 1981. \nSo, <italic>McKinsey</italic> depended on her other first Black recruit from 1968, James Lowry, to consult on studies including the centralization of Tanzanian\u2019s governmental structure and increasing Black hires. Among <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s first partners was Roger Ferguson, after he graduated <italic>Harvard Law</italic> with a JD and economics doctorate and joined <italic>Davis Polk</italic> in 1981 until joining <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 1984. Likewise, <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s first Black female hire, <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic> Business graduate Jacqueline Bradley joined in 1982 but left to a variety of finance roles within two years. \nOther Black lawyers also thrived. Born into the housing projects on the west side of segregated Atlanta, Vernon Jordan chauffeured for <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>\u2019s Maddox family while at <italic>DePaul Uni</italic>. After graduating from the traditionally Black <italic>Howard </italic>Law, he returned to Atlanta as a civil rights lawyer, and helped desegregate <italic>Uni of Georgia</italic> by escorting the first Black student onto campus. Through the 1960s, he worked with Reverend Martin King Jr and other civil rights leaders. \nWhile serving as Executive Director of <italic>United Negro College Fund</italic>, Jordan became Executive Director of <italic>Urban League</italic>, after Whitney Young died in 1971. While promoting Black economic empowerment, Jordan became prominent in the business, and was known for his ability to connect Black professionals with corporate leaders. His board service included <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, <italic>Celanese</italic>, <italic>JC Penney</italic>, <italic>Union Carbide</italic>, and <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic>.. While Strauss struggled to get the <italic>Urban League</italic> and Black endorsements for Carter in 1976, he hired Jordan to join <italic>Akin Gump</italic> in 1981 to access his network.\nAnd Brooklyn-born Richard Parsons graduated from <italic>Uni of Hawaii</italic> and <italic>Albany </italic>Law<italic> </italic>in 1971. While his grandfather had been the head groundskeeper on the Rockefeller estate in Westchester County, Parsons became Nelson Rockefeller\u2019s lawyer without telling him about the relation. Later, when Rockefeller became VP under President Ford in 1974, Parsons serving as a senior White House aide. Returning to New York in 1977, he joined the Rockefeller-affiliated law firm <italic>Patterson</italic> <italic>Belknap</italic>, making Partner in two years and Managing Partner soon after.\nAfter graduating <italic>Bowdoin College</italic> and <italic>Harvard Law in</italic> 1976, Ken Chenault joined Wall Street law firm <italic>Rogers Wells</italic> for three years before moving back to Boston to joining some of his classmates at <italic>Bain</italic>. By 1981, Chenault began his career at <italic>American Express</italic>. He played a pivotal role in revitalizing the merchandise-services division and steadily climbed the ranks. His mother hailed from an affluent South Carolina family that had founded a cargo-shipping business in the early 1900s. In contrast, his father was born to a butler and a maid, but excelled academically, earning honors at <italic>Morehouse College</italic> and obtaining a dentistry degree from <italic>Howard </italic>in 1939.\nSince the <italic>Voting Rights Act of 1965</italic>, Blacks thrived politically at a local level. After Detroit elected Black Coleman Young in 1973, he proposed a 50/50 partnership between Black and majority businesses and professionals who had been previously excluded from city work. As urban America elected Black mayors since the 1970s, they mirrored these policies in cities like Cleveland (Carl Stokes, since 1967), Los Angeles (Tom Bradley, 1973), Atlanta (Maynard Jackson, 1974), Washington DC (Marion Barry, 1979), Chicago (Harold Washington, 1983), and NYC (David Dinkins, 1990).\nSo, minorities grew in public finance banking. While <italic>American Express Shearson</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic> hired Napoleon Brandford as a VP in 1982, he left to form <italic>Grigsby Brandford</italic>, the premier Black-owned investment bank, by 1985. And after Clarence Otis started at <italic>Kidder</italic> in 1984, he left to become a CSFB VP in 1987. Having reorganized New York City, Rohatyn hired New York City\u2019s <italic>Budget Office</italic>\u2019s general counsel, Eugene Keilin\u2014who was White, but whose father represented poor and Black clients in Texan courts after WWII\u2014to advise Cleveland, Detroit, and the <italic>United Steelworkers Union</italic>. \nRohatyn also hired OMB Associate Director Frank Raines after Carter\u2019s defeat to reorg debt in DC, Chicago, Iowa, and Texas. A year after Raines became the first Black big broker partner at <italic>Lazard</italic> in 1985, <italic>Goldman</italic> promoted Garland Wood, who had graduated <italic>Columbia</italic> Business in 1972 and then advised municipal bond refunding for California, Kentucky, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. After graduating <italic>Harvard </italic>in 1971, Puerto Rican Aida Alvarez reported news for seven years before served as VP of New York\u2019s <italic>Health & Hospitals Corp</italic> in 1984. Within a year, she became a Public Finance VP at <italic>Bear</italic> until 1988, when she moved to do the same job at CSFB. \nWhile Rohatyn built support for a new RFC, Reagan listened to OMB\u2019s Stockman and economist Alan Greenspan that it would crowd out private investment and continued to oppose it. Likewise, CSFB hired Ron Gault as a public finance director. The Chicago-born <italic>Grinnell College</italic> graduate worked with <italic>Urban League</italic> until joining federal service in 1964\u2014including USAID, State Department, and DOJ\u2014until 1969, when he joined the <italic>Ford Foundation</italic> until 1978 and advised Mayor Ed Koch afterward.\nBlacks also broke into dealmaking. Born to a roofer and maid in Virginia, William Lewis\u2014unrelated to Reginald\u2014earned subsidies to attend <italic>Andover</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> before joining <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> in 1982. By 1987, Lewis helped open <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Chicago office. Similarly, a social worker mother raised Raymond McGuire in Ohio before he attended <italic>Hotchkiss</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> and joined<italic> </italic>CSFB in 1982. So did Black women. \nThe daughter of a Brooklyn minister from South Carolina, Deborah Wright graduated <italic>Harvard</italic>, <italic>Harvard</italic> Business, and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law by the age of 26 in 1984. Joining CSFB in corporate finance, she left in 1987 to become an affordable home ownership advocate in Harlem. (While her relationship to <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic>\u2019s Richard Wright is unclear, her grandfather was a reverend in South Carolina and her aunt, Marian, was a civil rights advocate, <italic>Yale</italic> Law graduate, and founder of <italic>Children</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Defense Fund </italic>in 1973. Like the wives of Vernon Jordan, Kenneth Chenault, and other Black elites, Marian was a member of <italic>Jack & Jill</italic>, which Dorothy Wright co-founded in 1946.) Also from the South, Carla Harris graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business in 1987, joining <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s M&A team, where she built a long career.\nOthers thrived as entrepreneurs. Continuing MESBICs, Reginald Lewis also led LBOs as a principal. Despite unsuccessful attempts in the 1970s, he formed <italic>Lewis </italic>in 1983, secured financing, and successfully acquired <italic>McCall Pattern</italic>, a producer of home-sewing kits, in 1984. Under Lewis\u2019 leadership, <italic>McCall</italic> enjoyed two profitable years before he sold it for $97 million. As <italic>Johnson Publishing</italic> expanded into magazines, radio stations, and cosmetics, <italic>Supreme</italic> LIC remained the oldest Black LIC, but outrun by other Black LICs and a small part of John Johnson\u2019s empire. In late 1984,<italic> </italic>his daughter Linda married Andre Rice, a <italic>Goldman</italic> M&A associate, in Chicago\u2019s \u2018<italic>most elaborate ceremony</italic>.\u2019 While Linda and her mother helped lead <italic>Johnson Publishing</italic>, Rice resigned from <italic>Goldman</italic> to go independent.\nFewer African Blacks joined banks, but CSFB continued hiring connected talent. Born to the first Nigerian-born professor of medicine of a Christianized elite family, Bayo Ogunlesi studied at local universities before graduating from <italic>Oxford</italic> and <italic>Harvard </italic>Law. After becoming the first non-American to clerk for the Court under Justice Thurgood Marshall, Ogunlesi briefly worked at <italic>Cravath</italic> in 1980 before becoming an adviser for a Nigerian natural gas project and joining CSFB from 1983. \nLikewise, since America enacted the <italic>Immigration Act of 1965</italic> and Indian PM Indira Nehru nationalized banks to expand rural credit in 1969, Indian Brahmins expanded from land lording into urban professionalism, ranging from bank executives in India to information technology consultants in America. While over 95% of Indians continued to marry in caste for decades, this shift altered their marriage criteria, with education and employment gaining significance in forging alliances among these urbanized families by the 1970s. \nLike the Jewish Kohen priestly caste, Brahmin Indians highly regarded scholarly pursuits and have a long history of involvement in banking. However, local affirmative action campaigns limited opportunities in India, leading many to move overseas. After <italic>McKinsey</italic> hired her initial Indians Tino Puri and Rajat Gupta by 1973, Vikram Pandit\u2014 the son of an executive director of <italic>Sarabhai Chemicals</italic> whose surname translates into scholar and priest in Hindi\u2014moved to America, earned a PhD in Finance at <italic>Columbia</italic>, and joined <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> in 1983, becoming one of the first Indians employed at the firm. \nMeanwhile, DOJ investigated <italic>Rich</italic> for tax evasion by trading with illegal regimes and reporting tax losses. Although experts later the approved practice, <italic>Rich</italic> paid penalties, and fled to Switzerland. With access to <italic>Paribas</italic> and BCCI\u2014which tapped British and American finance via JMB and other banks\u2014, <italic>Rich</italic> grew as Marc Rich remained a fugitive. As Reagan reversed antitrust policy, DOJ reformed antitrust to allow greater market share in competitive markets. DOJ dropped her 1969 case against IBM and allowed <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> and<italic> Lazard </italic>to re-cartelize global copper, but broke AT&T\u2019s monopoly following Britain.\nAs Congress debated CP and repo reform, SEC eased shelf requirements for CP direct to MMMFs sales\u2014allowing for longer maturity CP\u2014and private security registration with <italic>Reg D</italic>\u2014fueling tax shelter partnerships. However, since the courts deemed CP securities, banks simulated CP instead of longer-term, risky loans, further shortening nonfinancial debt. \nIn late 1983, FRS allowed brokers to use UST and Federal agency debt, bankers\u2019 acceptances, and CDs as securities lending collateral. Within a few months, another repo broker failure set off a run from repos. During the <italic>Panic of 1984</italic>, Congress enacted . In addition to exempting repos, bankers\u2019 acceptances, and CDs from the automatic stay, BA1984 reduced BA1978\u2019s CP preference. But the run from repo led dealers to sell collateral, mooting the stay exemption. \nWhile most firms recovered from losses on UST bond positions, internationally owned bond specialist <italic>Becker</italic> destabilized. Since <italic>Paribas</italic> <italic>Warburg</italic> acquired <italic>Becker</italic> in 1974, <italic>Paribas</italic> acquired <italic>Warburg</italic>\u2019s stake in 1984. Following losses during the <italic>Panic of 1984</italic>, conflict between the British, French, and American partners and the sale of <italic>Becker</italic> to <italic>Merrill Lynch</italic>. \nHowever, London\u2019s other largest investment bank, <italic>Kleinwor</italic><italic>t</italic><italic> Benson</italic>, acquired a California swaps group, a Chicago futures broker, and UST bond dealer, ACLI, from <italic>Donaldson Lufkin</italic>. Making <italic>Kleinwor</italic><italic>t</italic> the first foreign bank to own a UST bond dealer with direct access to FRS <italic>New York</italic>, ACLI dealt with up-and-coming dealers, including ESM <italic>Government Securities</italic> of Florida. \nThe main victims, however, were state-insured S&Ls. Instead of federal FSLIC, <italic>Ohio Deposit Guaranty Fund</italic> (\u201cODGF\u201d) started in 1956 to insure deposits at state-chartered S&Ls. Similarly, <italic>Maryland Savings Share Insurance Corp</italic> (\u201cMSSIC\u201d) several years later. Cheaper that FSLIC, these insurers fostered S&Ls. One of the earliest was in the Cincinnati suburbs. Having made a fortune in the post-WWII housing boom, Marvin Warner bought the small state-chartered <italic>Home State </italic>S&L (\u201cHSSB\u201d) by 1958 and grew it into the largest S&L in Southern Ohio, accounting for 20% of ODGF\u2019s covered deposits by 1984. Warner also invested in and become CEO of Florida-based <italic>American</italic> S&L.\nAfter government bond dealer <italic>Lion Capital Group</italic> of New York failed in May 1984, ESM <italic>Government Securities</italic> of Florida, which was in the same industry, was saved by a collateral contribution from HSSB. By March 4, 1985, ESM collapsed after fraudulently pledging identical collateral to multiple lenders and conducting overcollateralized reverse repos, allowing excessive borrowing while hiding accumulating losses. \nAlong with <italic>Kleinwor</italic><italic>t Benson </italic>and the municipal governments of Beaumont, Texas, and Toledo, Ohio,<italic> American</italic> S&L and HSSB faced losses. With HSSB\u2019s loss of $145 million surpassing its net worth and triggering a rapid run on the bank, with withdrawals exceeding $150 million within days. By March 14, heavy withdrawals by depositors began at several ODGF-insured S&Ls in the Cincinnati area caused seven other members to become insolvent, Ohio Governor Richard Celeste to suspend operations of all 71 ODGF-insured S&Ls the following morning. \nFRS <italic>Cleveland</italic> President Karen Horn played a crucial role as a moderator and adviser while hosting bank officials, state banking officials, and FRS, FSLIC, and FDIC examiners from DC. But the underlying problem remained. By April, New Jersey-based BBSAM collapsed for similar reasons to ESM, revealing a negative net worth of around $225 million. This collapse rocked Little Rock, Arkansas, where $2 million of losses wiped out <italic>Collins Securities</italic>, and <italic>Worthen Bank & Trust Co</italic> faced losses of $52 million, prompting plans to offset this potential loss by tapping other Arkansas banks. \nAfter the failure of ODGF in March 1985, MSSIC institutions in Maryland began to lose deposits in a \u2018silent run.\u2019<italic> </italic>As MSSIC\u2019s second-largest member, <italic>Old Court</italic>, and <italic>Merritt</italic> S&Ls took losses and depositors ran, Governor Hughes appointed conservators for both S&Ls and imposed a limit on withdrawals from MSSIC institutions. The same day, FRS <italic>Richmond</italic> lent $50 million to <italic>Old Court </italic>S&L only, and FRS Chair Volcker reiterated support for S&Ls. \nWhile MSSIC soon failed, the system settled down as it became clear that Ohio, Maryland, and federal taxpayers would bailout these state-insured S&Ls. Along with the failure of state deposit insurance, dealer failures led repo dealers and creditors and several large clearing banks to reduce dealer financing and delivering costs by developing a new form of repo, tri-party repo. Since SIPA exempted brokers dealing UST securities, Congress enacted the <italic>Government Securities Act of 1986</italic> to authorize UST to govern all government securities brokers and dealers.\nSuch regional problems created opportunities for inter-state banks. <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s continued advised banks to focus on customer types\u2014such as retail customers or commercial banking clients\u2014rather than geography to maintain a lean organization structure while expanding. Since retaining <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 1981, the tiny <italic>North Carolina</italic> NB\u2019s Hugh McColl embarked on a transformative growth strategy. \nMcColl\u2019s McColl\u2019s grandfather and great-grandfather were also bankers, and continued with his father running <italic>Bank of Marlboro</italic> in Bennettsville, South Carolina. Likewise, his brothers worked at <italic>South Carolina </italic>NB in Greenville and <italic>Citizens Southern</italic> NB in Columbia. After McColl started at <italic>American Commercial Bank</italic>, he married Jane Spratt, whose family was a principal stockholder in <italic>Bank of York</italic> in York, South Carolina.\nAcquiring <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Lake City</italic> in Florida in 1982, <italic>North Carolina</italic> NB expanded further. Likewise, following the Court\u2019s decision in June 1985 upholding regional reciprocal interstate banking and allowing banks to operate across state lines, North Carolina\u2019s <italic>Wachovia</italic> merged with <italic>First </italic>NB <italic>of Atlanta</italic>. \nAnd along with inter-state banks, North Carolina\u2019s <italic>First Union</italic> acquired <italic>Northwestern Financial </italic>of the same state in the largest merger in North Carolina\u2019s history to create the state\u2019s second largest bank. As North Carolina banks expanded in Georgia, Georgia and Florida enacted reciprocal interstate banking laws, and <italic>Trust Co of Georgia</italic> merged with Orlando-based <italic>SunBank </italic>in 1985, followed by <italic>Third National </italic>of Nashville in 1986. While rebranding, <italic>SunTrust</italic>, continued to be buoyed by her <italic>Coca Cola</italic> holdings. And while the Salt Lake City-headquartered <italic>First Security</italic> BHC suffered as gas prices fell and Utah allowed <italic>Citi</italic> to compete, Spencer Eccles managed to keep the bank independent. Likewise, Fellow Salt Lake City Mormon <italic>Zions First</italic> NB entered Arizona and Nevada.\nWhile BA1984 limited consumer discharges, consumer bankruptcies grew as business failures stabilized after quadrupling post-BA1978. BA1978 allowed consumers to discharge debts in bankruptcy. In addition, unsecured consumer credit increased as the Court deregulated states\u2019 anti-usury protectionism by allowing corporations from other states to export interest rates in 1978. \nSince California began the national transition from fault-based to no-fault divorce laws in 1969, courts divided assets more equitably without regard for fault, and divorce rates surged. After the Court legalized abortion in 1973, Congress prohibited credit discrimination based on race, gender, or other factors in 1974 and with TA1976 extended TA1954\u2019s childcare tax credits. Some efforts backfired as banks turned down more female borrowers. Although BA1978 initially disrupted consumer credit, single female bankrupts grew from 22% of the total in 1981 to nearly 40% by 1999. And since rates of single mothers greatly increased, Thomas Sowell and other economists blamed <italic>Great Society </italic>for fostering out-of-wedlock births and dependency on federal grants, leading TA1981 to reduce aid to single mothers.\n<italic>Panic of 1985</italic>\nDuring the <italic>Panic of 1953</italic>, UST extended TA1921\u2019s stock plan tax exemption to <italic>Employee Stock Ownership Plans</italic> (\u201cESOPs\u201d) rather than discount insider loans. Using the ESOP ruling of 1953, <italic>Kelso</italic> led the first <italic>leveraged buyout</italic> (\u201cLBO\u201d) by employee unions in 1956. Kelso taught oil-rich Oklahoman George Roberts, who was courting his niece, about LBOs. Meanwhile, Oklahoman Alan Greenberg rose to run <italic>Bear</italic>\u2019s trading. While Jerome Kohlberg, a descendant of Bohemia\u2019s silver Mint Jew Jacob Bassevi, started as an attorney he became a banker for <italic>Bear </italic>to help clients avoid estate taxes via LBOs in 1965. \nAs the strategy took too long for <italic>Bear</italic> partners, Kohlberg partnered Oklahoma-oil heir Henry Kravis and his cousin George Roberts to form <italic>Kohlberg Kravis </italic><italic>Roberts </italic>(KKR\u201d) in 1975. Among the earliest and largest investors in KKR were <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic>, <italic>Continental Bank of New York</italic>, and <italic>Prudential Insurance</italic>. While the Head of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic>\u2019s SBIC arm Stanley Golder became Chair of <italic>National Association of SBICs</italic> and <italic>National Venture Capital Association</italic>, he and other Chicago investors worked with <italic>Kirkland Ellis</italic> tax partner Jack Levin.\nWhile <italic>Lazard </italic>New York also engaged in what they called VC activities, the deals that built relationship-based ventures using leveraged buyouts (\u201cLBOs\u201d) more than on early-stage technology innovation venture capital (\u201cVC\u201d). Andr\u00e9 Meyer sought to identify asset-rich companies, acquire a substantial 20-25% ownership stake, and participate on boards to collaborate with management. \nHe usually carried out such transformations through strategic hires. Since <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic>\u2019s Ludwig Vogelstein, the son of a leading reform rabbi in Stettin, started <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic> America in the 1880s, the company fused with <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> America into <italic>AMAX</italic>, where Ludwig\u2019s nephew Hans Vogelstein ascended, becoming President in 1957. Back in 1953, Andr\u00e9 Meyer hired Hans\u2019 son John\u2014a childhood friend of Felix Rohatyn\u2014to curry favor with <italic>AMAX</italic>. Although Hans died in 1960, Hans became <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s General Partner and Head of Research in 1964.\nMeanwhile, <italic>Warburg</italic> New York\u2019s Eric Warburg returned to Germany to restore <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg. Not wanting to lay off employees, he sold <italic>Warburg </italic>New York to <italic>Pincus</italic>. Donald Blinken helped organize<italic> Warburg Pincus.</italic> His father, Maurice had served as the American representative for <italic>Marks Spencer</italic> before founding hardware machinery manufacturer MITE in 1953 with his son Robert. Maurice had close ties with Eric Warburg, with whom Donald worked in Hamburg before joining Eric Warburg\u2019s second cousin Sigmund at <italic>Warburg</italic> London in 1960. Donald later advised his friend Lionel Pincus to join with Warburg in 1966.\nLionel Pincus\u2019 grandparents were part of the Belarussian Eliasberg families\u2014an extended Katz cousin of Chaya Louri\u00e9 of Pinsk and Rabbi Ezekiel Landau of Brody\u2014and immigrated to America, where their children founded an apparel manufacturing and retail businesses. After attending <italic>Columbia</italic> Business, Pincus joined <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann </italic>and later became head of Corporate Finance. Shortly after leaving to start <italic>Pincus</italic> in 1964, he created <italic>Warburg Pincus.</italic> Sigmund Warburg of <italic>Warburg</italic> London did not like that <italic>Warburg Pincus</italic> used the <italic>Warburg</italic> brand. To grow<italic>, Warburg Pincus</italic> hired John Vogelstein who left <italic>Lazard</italic> New York Following a falling out with Andr\u00e9 Meyer. Although a VC, <italic>Warburg Pincus</italic> invested in a range of companies, not just startups, and Pincus helped found <italic>National Venture Capital Association</italic> in 1973.\nHowever, KKR and ESOPs were obscure and insignificant relative to conglomerates. Divestitures grew and exit options broadened as courts expanded non-taxable spin-offs, spurring LBOs and hostile takeovers to restructure corporate activity. Some LBOs used long-term convertible debt for stock swaps. As these were taxable transactions, buyers stepped up asset amortization and deducted interest expenses, while sellers received a premium and conversion upside with deferred capital gains taxes. As this debt was unsecured, covenants had fewer restrictions on leases and acquisitions.\nAnother successful buyout specialist also had connections to Oklahoma. Born to an agnostic Jewish mother and Unitarian father, the Allen brothers grew up without hot water in New York. While Charles Allen quit school at fifteen to work as a runner for a securities firm <italic>Sartorius Smith</italic> before forming <italic>Allen</italic> with his dropout brother Herbert and minimal resources from his wife in 1922. He soon traded bonds with Norman Hirschfield, who graduated <italic>Columbia </italic>and joined <italic>Lamport</italic>, rising from office boy to Partner by 1931. In 1938, Hirschfield moved to Oklahoma City to manage <italic>Consolidated Gas Utilities</italic> for <italic>Lamport. </italic>As Hirschfield ascended at the firm, he scouted business opportunities for <italic>Allen</italic>. \nShortly after the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, Herbert Allen acquired a third of <italic>Benguet</italic>, a large American gold producer in Japanese-occupied Philippines. The investment paid off after WWII. By 1951, Allen bought <italic>Ogden</italic>, a bankrupt listed PUHC with large NOCs. <italic>Ogden</italic> soon bought <italic>Avondale</italic> shipyards, the largest employer in Louisiana,<italic> </italic>the <italic>Luria</italic> scrap metal company, and <italic>Syntex</italic>, patent owner of norethindrone, the basic ingredient in birth control pills. By 1954, Hirschfield left <italic>Consolidated Gas</italic>, became Chair of <italic>Oklahoma Turnpike Authority</italic>, and led <italic>Allen</italic>\u2019s new venture, which fused <italic>Wrigley</italic>, a chain of 60 supermarkets of Michigan, and <italic>Standard-Humpty Dumpty</italic> of Oklahoma and <italic>Big Bear Markets</italic> of Michigan, both of which had 33 stores each. Rebranding as <italic>Allied Supermarket</italic>, the company soon bought <italic>Foodtown</italic> of Ohio and <italic>Fred Rapp</italic> grocery chain of Missouri, becoming the nation\u2019s tenth-largest food chain.\nMeanwhile, the sons of Russian immigrants in Brooklyn, Bob and Larry Tisch expanded their parent\u2019s hotel investments. Their pinnacle achievement came in 1956 with the construction of the $17 million <italic>Americana Hotel</italic> in Florida. So, when a DOJ antitrust suit forced MGM to divest <italic>Loew</italic> theaters in 1959, the Tisches bought it for real estate holdings, swiftly liquidating 50 theaters. Before the Tisches turned <italic>Loew</italic> into a HC by 1969 and bought the <italic>Lorillard</italic> tobacco conglomerate with <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s advice, they precipitated the reorganization of the move and entertainment industry.\nAfter Herbert Allen\u2019s son Herbert Jr graduated <italic>Williams College</italic> and Norman Hirschfield\u2019s son Alan graduated <italic>Uni of Oklahoma</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business, they joined <italic>Allen</italic> in 1964. As the elder brothers spun off their VC operations, Herbert Jr took control, and invested in dozens of small, high-technology stocks. Since Charles Allen had long been a <italic>Warner</italic> director and friend of Jack Warner, he added Alan Hirschfield to the board of his <italic>Seven Arts</italic> HC that year, and instructed Hirschfield to buy Jack Warner\u2019s <italic>Warner</italic> by 1967 with <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s advice. As Allen made Hirschfield <italic>Warner</italic>\u2019s VP for finance, <italic>Warner</italic> pivoted from making new movies to selling broadcasting rights and branched out into music, acquiring <italic>Atlantic </italic>and <italic>Elektra</italic> records by 1970. By 1973, Herbert Jr<italic> </italic>effectively gained control of <italic>Columbia Pictures</italic> with only about 5% of the stock, installing Alan Hirschfield as CEO.\nUnlike <italic>Allen</italic>, other conglomerates absorbed movie studios. <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s Ferdinand Eberstadt assisted in <italic>United Artists</italic>\u2019 formation in the 1920s and facilitated the sale of the RKO film library to <italic>United Artists</italic> in the late 1950s. After joining <italic>Lazard</italic> New York, he maintained close relationships with <italic>United Artists</italic>\u2019 key figures, considering buying out Mary Pickford\u2019s remaining interest in the company before Robert Benjamin and Arthur Krim did so. Eberstadt led <italic>United Artists</italic>\u2019 initial public offering in 1957. In 1968, <italic>TransAmerica</italic> LIC bought <italic>United Artists </italic>with <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s advice.\nAnother example is <italic>Gulf+Western</italic>. A Jewish refugee from Austria arrived in America in 1942 and joined the army. With the end of WWII, Charles Bluhdorn worked at a New York cotton brokerage house before formed an import-export concern in 1949 and becoming wealthy. By 1956, he acquired a small Grand Rapids auto-parts company, merging it with a Houston distributor to establish <italic>Gulf+Western</italic>. After acquiring <italic>New Jersey Zinc Co</italic> in 1966, the conglomerate bought <italic>Paramount </italic>in 1967. By 1974, Bluhdorn promoted co-religionists, led by his long-time associate Martin Davis to be his second-in-command at <italic>Paramount</italic>. Davis soon hired Barry Diller and his second in command, Michael Eisner. \nBarry Diller\u2019s ancestors fled Galicia around the turn of the century to San Francisco and went into grocery and burial businesses. While American-born farther became a successful real estate developer in Southern California after WWII, Barry dropped out of UCLA and started his career at <italic>William Morris Agency</italic> in 1961 as a mail boy, ascending to talent agent by 1964. Transferring to ABC, he served as VP in charge of prime-time programming and hired Michael Eisner by the 1970s. \nWhile Eisner graduated from <italic>Denison College</italic>, his family had associated with the Lehman and Loeb families. His great-grandfather, Bohemian immigrant Sigmund Eisner, started as a peddler and transformed two sewing machines into a company that manufactured uniforms for <italic>Boy Scouts</italic> and the Army, including outfits for Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s <italic>Rough Riders</italic>. Sigmund married Bertha Weiss, who\u2019s family founded Red Bank, New Jersey, and created that city\u2019s largest employer. The grandson Sigmund and Bertha, Jacob, married Margaret Dammann, who\u2019s family founded <italic>American Safety Razor</italic>, the longtime rival of <italic>Gillette Safety Razor</italic>.\nHowever, Walt Disney continued to refuse to hire Jews. After his daughter married football player Ronald Miller, Miller rose from his father-in-law chauffeur to <italic>Disney</italic> producer and continued after Walt died in 1966. But the regulation continued to remake the entertainment industry. In 1970, CBS formed <italic>Viacom</italic> to comply with FCC regulations preventing TV networks from owning cable systems or syndicating their shows. <italic>Viacom</italic> became a separate company in 1971 when CBS distributed its stock to CBS shareholders at a ratio of one <italic>Viacom</italic> share for every seven CBS shares, allowing <italic>Viacom</italic> to operate independently in cable TV and program syndication, soon expanding into radio.\nSimilarly, studios faced legal threats from competitors. Born in Boston to Galician refugees, Michael Rothstein anglicized his name to Redstone and built a drive through movie theater chain, <italic>National Amusements</italic>. His son, Sumner graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> and, after wartime service in Army intelligence, pursued law. Joining <italic>National Amusements</italic> in 1954, Redstone utilized his legal acumen to challenge movie studios and reshape film distribution for drive-ins. Transitioning from drive-ins to indoor cinemas and innovating multiplexes, Sumner continued to grow <italic>National Amusements </italic>and conglomerate from the 1970s.\nMeanwhile, corporations acquired NOCs. By buying startups, mature companies grew prospects with lower risk. Acquirers\u2019 shareholders gained lower tax rates than if they sold to reinvest dividends into companies with NOCs. So, they traded in appreciated and illiquid shares for long-term stakes in diverse conglomerates that could be used as collateral while deferring taxes using the <italic>General Utilities</italic> <italic>Doctrine</italic> (\u201cGUD\u201d). As firms increasingly conglomerated, the Court supported DOJ under AA1950 to block asset purchase mergers in vertically and horizontally related industries in 1962. \nReplacing the acquisitions of the 1960s, TA1969 fueled business exchange with high capital gains tax and long net operating loss carryovers (\u201cNOCs\u201d). However, as Congress taxed lease rents less other income, high bracket taxpayers shifted to NOCs and leases from equities and VC. Unlike taxable divestments, although the Court\u2019s GUD permitted tax-free spin-offs to stockholders, but TA1969 restricted it. So firms trafficked NOC-heavy units to reduce taxes.\nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1956</italic>, the Boston Brahmin-led <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> invested in their international operations in 1957 and funded <italic>Harvard</italic>-graduate An Wang, founder of <italic>Wang Laboratories</italic> by 1958. Helping revive Massachusetts\u2019 economy, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> soon funded <italic>Data General Corp</italic> and other high-tech companies. After <italic>Cabot</italic> petrochemical\u2019s Louis Cabot became a director of FRS <italic>Boston</italic> in 1970 and Chair in 1975,  he left in 1978 and joined <italic>Wang</italic>\u2019s board in 1982.\nIn 1957, Eugene Kleiner, one of eight engineers from <italic>Shockley Semiconductors</italic>, reached out to <italic>Hayden Stone</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Arthur Rock in New York. Rock agreed to secure funding for this group of engineers to start their own company. They struck a deal with Sherman Fairchild, head of <italic>Fairchild Camera & Equipment </italic>and <italic>Fairchild Hiller</italic>\u2019s <italic>Republic Aviation</italic>. Fairchild\u2019s inventive prowess led him to independently advance aerial cameras and mapping technology although his father founded IBM. <italic>Fairchild</italic> <italic>Semiconductor</italic> rapidly excelled in silicon transistor development for military and space applications, shaping the industry\u2019s transition to silicon technology. This success prompted Rock to arrange a private placement in another California company, <italic>Teledyne</italic>, in 1960. \nBy 1965, Sherman Fairchild joined fellow IBM shareholders Thomas and Arthur Watson and Boston Brahmins, including Warren Corning, <italic>Citi</italic> banker Edwin Thorne, and others to found <italic>Greylock</italic> VC. Since 1957, VCs and other investors founded 24 new semiconductor companies. Of the 13 that emerged in Silicon Valley, former <italic>Fairchild Semiconductor</italic> employees started 8. \nLike KKR and <italic>Warburg Pincus</italic>, some VCs were extensions of established financiers. Retiring to California from government and <italic>Dillon</italic> in the 1950s, Brigadier General William Draper Jr formed an investors club to back technology spinoffs from <italic>Fairchild </italic>and<italic> Hewlett-Packard</italic> <italic>Computer</italic>. In 1958, he founded the first West Coast VC firm, <italic>Draper Gaither Anderson</italic>, with <italic>Rand</italic> founder Rowan Gaither and retired Air Force General Frederick Anderson. \nWhile most venture organizations at the time raised capital through closed-end funds or SBICs, <italic>Draper Gaither Anderson</italic> was the first VC limited partnership to pool non-familial investments exempt from securities regulations under SA1940. After joining his father\u2019s <italic>Draper Gaither Anderson</italic> VC in 1959, William Draper III co-founded <italic>Draper Johnson</italic> SBIC three years later. By 1965, he partnered with <italic>Sutter Hill Land </italic>SBIC to form <italic>Sutter Hill</italic> VC, soon funding <italic>Apollo Computer</italic>, LSI <italic>Logic</italic>, and <italic>Quantum</italic>.\nLike with funding aviation in the 1930s, Nelson Rockefeller\u2019s son, Laurance, founded <italic>Rockefeller </italic>family VC in 1946, seeded <italic>Intel</italic> and reorged into <italic>Venrock</italic> in 1969. Fred Hellman, a former <italic>Lehman</italic> partner and great-grandson of <italic>Wells Fargo</italic>\u2019s Isaiah Hellman, started <italic>Matrix </italic>VC in 1976 out of Boston<italic>.</italic> Some, VCs had mixed funders. Since Hambrecht ran <italic>DuPont</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> west coast corporate finance and Quist worked at <italic>Bank of America</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> SBA group they founded West coast investment bank <italic>Hambrecht</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Quist </italic>in 1968 with funds from former <italic>Hewlett-Packard </italic>executive Thomas Perkins (not a Boston Brahmin). \nBy 1972, Perkins partnered with Eugene Kleiner to form <italic>Kleiner Perkins</italic>, the first VC run by technology executives. Soon investing in <italic>Tandem Computers</italic>, <italic>Applied Materials</italic>, and <italic>Genentech</italic>. Others followed. After pioneering semiconductors <italic>Fairchild </italic>and <italic>National</italic>, Donald Thomas Valentine established <italic>Sequoia</italic> VC in 1972, which backed <italic>Oracle</italic>, <italic>Cisco</italic>, and others. <italic>Oracle</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s </italic>founder Larry Ellison grew up in a group home after his unwed mother gave him up. Another tech founder, Steve Jobs was adopted after his grandparents disapproved of his Syrian father.\nAntitrust guided VC investing. Since 1969, DOJ focused her attention on IBM, which hired <italic>Cravath</italic> for over a decade of antitrust litigation. This stimulated upstart competition, including <italic>Apple </italic>and<italic> Microsoft</italic>. Founded by Steve Jobs, <italic>Apple </italic>raised VC funding from <italic>Venrock</italic>, Arthur Rock, <italic>Hambrecht</italic>, <italic>Matrix</italic>, <italic>Sequoia</italic> in the 1970s. Instead of building capital-intensive machines, <italic>Microsoft</italic> licensed software with less need for VC links as founder William Gates III (\u201cBill Gates\u201d) was born into a powerful family. \nHis great-grandfather James Maxwell Sr was born to a founding doctor of Lincoln, Nebraska, and moved to Washington in 1906, where he worked as NB, founded <italic>National City Bank </italic>in Seattle, and presided over <italic>Title Trust Co</italic> and <italic>Northern</italic> LIC. After the 1929 merger with NB <italic>of Commerce of Seattle</italic>, he served as President and later Chair of the new bank until his death in 1951. James Jr, entered banking in 1925, rising to VP at <italic>Pacific</italic> NB (later <italic>First Interstate</italic>, America\u2019s 9th largest bank). James Jr\u2019s daughter married William Gates II, later a President of the <italic>Washington State Bar</italic> and chaired several <italic>American Bar Association</italic> commissions. In 1966, Jr became a senior partner in the law firm of <italic>Shidler McBroom Gates</italic>, which was rooted in Republican politics, and focused on manufacturing, high technology, and merchandising.\nTo revive <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s relationship-based ventures inactive since the mid-60s, Andr\u00e9 Meyer sought to identify asset-rich companies, acquire a substantial 20-25% ownership stake, and participate on boards to collaborate with management. When hiring Frank Pizzitola in 1973, Meyer informed him, \u201c<italic>I have enough bankers; I need an industrialist</italic>.\u201d Having led <italic>ER Squibb</italic>, <italic>Celanese</italic>, and building materials company<italic> Jim Walter</italic> before <italic>Lazard</italic>, he subsequently focused on M&A activities in the chemical and petrochemical industries. His board directorates included <italic>ITE Imperial</italic>, <italic>Allied Chemical</italic>, <italic>Grand Metropolitan</italic>, <italic>Lyonnaise des Eaux</italic>, <italic>Westmark</italic> <italic>International</italic>, and <italic>Sterling Chemicals</italic>. While large conglomerates grew by interlocking directorates with rivals and creditors, banks lost centrality as corporate executives joined bank boards at a lower rates.\nHowever, the most important securities firm of the 1980s would be <italic>Drexel Burnham Lambert</italic> (\u201cDBL\u201d). While <italic>Drexel </italic>partnered with <italic>Jay</italic> <italic>Cooke</italic> and added <italic>Morgan </italic>in 1871 before fusing into <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Drexel</italic> split off into a separate firm after FA1933. Along with TA1933 and other anti-monopoly legislation, IW Burnham parlayed his grandfather\u2019s Kentucky bourbon fortune to form <italic>Burnham</italic> in 1935. After selling a minority interest to a British firm in 1960, <italic>Harriman Ripley </italic>merged with <italic>Drexel</italic> in 1965. While <italic>Drexel Harriman Ripley</italic> raised cash from her client <italic>Firestone</italic> after the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>, she continued ailing despite her \u2018white shoe\u2019 image. And despite venturing into investment banking, <italic>Burnham</italic> was still lacking the clout to underwrite stocks and bonds independently. So, the \u2018sub-major\u2019 <italic>Burnham</italic> merged with the \u2018major\u2019 <italic>Drexel Firestone</italic> to create <italic>Drexel Burnham</italic> in 1973. \nIn Belgium, meanwhile, the Rothschild-cousin Leon Lambert sought to revive <italic>Lambert</italic>. After investing in Wall Street research company <italic>William Witter</italic>, <italic>Lambert </italic>sold her German partnership to <italic>Lazard</italic> London, and agreed to be a buy-merger with <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic>\u2014financed by <italic>Barclay</italic>, <italic>Dresdner</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and Belgian partners\u2014by 1975 into one of Belgium\u2019s largest banks. <italic>Lambert</italic> VP Jacques Rothschild Thierry became Chair of <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> after the merger. After Lambert sold out of the Rothschild\u2019s <italic>New Court Securities</italic> by 1977,<italic></italic><italic> </italic><italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> bought <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic> from the Gunzburgs and other investors.\nBy then, <italic>Lambert Witter</italic> merged with <italic>Drexel Burnham</italic> into <italic>Drexel Burnham</italic><italic> Lambert </italic> (\u201cDBL\u201d) with Tubby Burnham as Chair in 1976 with Lambert retaining an interest. DBL targeted underserved markets, and hired Michael Milken. While working on his MBA at <italic>Wharton</italic>, Milken discovered that while low-bonds paid high premiums relative to high-rated bonds, their default rates were similar. By forming diversified portfolios of well-research, low-rated bonds, Milken outperformed highly rated bond portfolios. \nMeanwhile, <italic>New Deal</italic> programs replaced sharecropping by encouraging farms to mechanize and consolidate, reducing labor as large farms grew production from 5 to 44% between 1929 and 1964. As farmers were safe from involuntary bankruptcy and state laws protected homesteads, creditors attached asset liens. Like other <italic>New Deal</italic> regulations, milk, orange, and sugar cartels split stable monopoly profits. After the <italic>Panic of 1960</italic>, EXIM created the <italic>Foreign Credit Insurance Association</italic> of fifty insurers to promote exports. \nSince TA1969 only targeted livestock tax shelters, Congress sparked a run to farmland after defunding HUD\u2019s urban real estate and enabling the <italic>Farm Credit System</italic> (\u201cFCS\u201d) to lend on land collateral in 1971. However, they removed subsidies from the <italic>Rural Electrification Authority</italic> by bringing it in line with federal rates. The <italic>Panic of 1974 </italic>accelerated the boom as creditors ran from inflationary <italic>dollars</italic> to farm tax shelters. As collateral appreciated, so did FCS\u2019 loans. While Congress curbed corporate farming tax shelters in 1976 and valued them \u2018at risk\u2019, farms continued bifurcating into numerous hobby plots and thousands mega-farms. \nIn the 1960s, bankers advocated capital efficiency as the farm industry had the most employees and assets. While three states banned corporate farming before the 1950s, seven midwestern states adopted such bans between 1971 and 1975. Some, like Nebraska allowed locally chartered corporations. However, family farmers limited liabilities using corporate structures. Farm tax shelters grew after the <italic>Panic of </italic>1<italic>974</italic> and as inflation made more investors liable for high capital gain taxes. By reducing the cost of existing debt, inflation increased servicing capacity and demand for new debt. \nInflation also attracted high-bracket taxpayers to leveraged tax shelters, which allowed tax-passthrough partnerships to purchase NOCs from unprofitable businesses. They used nonrecourse debt secured by the underlying property to leverage the losses with limited personal liability. Although the shelters were liable for tax recapture in case of bankruptcy, this changed after 1975. Inflation had a similar effect on corporations. With depressed equity valuations since 1974, LBOs bought NOC-laden firms. \nLBOs used tax-deductible debt financing, which reduced investor taxes at payoff per GUD and because UST taxed capital gains below dividends. While KKR and securities firms started <italic>management</italic> LBOs (\u201cMBOs\u201d) with divestitures, they soon led whole company MBOs. Against these \u2018freezeouts\u2019 of minority shareholders, SEC sought to apply <italic>insider trading</italic> <italic>laws </italic>(\u201cIT\u201d). For the first time, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> led respectable securities firms in hostile LBOs by financing <italic>NICKEL</italic>\u2019s takeover of an American battery maker. Although DOJ sued to undo the merger and FRS requested banks avoid leveraged lending, hostile LBOs and MBOs grew. \nDuring the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>, Congress enacted ERISA to permit diversifying risky assets and resuscitating pensions, which bought annuities from life insurance companies (\u201cLICs\u201d). LICs sold deferred annuities to shelter taxes and invested in the higher-yielding private debt of middle-market firms unable to issue public bonds. Finally, after <italic>Kelso </italic>lobbying, ERISA stimulated employee-led LBOs with ESOP benefits. Before then, with , they extended NOCs to aid profitless corporations and stimulated ESOPs as alternatives to mergers. As NOCs lost their business continuation requirement, they increased in size and term. Moreover, inter-company transfers were to be restricted after 1978. \nTA1976 limited nonrecourse debt to lever NOCs\u2014except for real estate and corporate leases\u2014and taxed capital gains to curb shelters. Taxes and inflation drove shelter demand, which securities firms supplied with syndicated partnerships. By 1979, <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic> acquired one of the country\u2019s largest mortgage-brokers, <italic>Sonnenblick</italic>. As equities investors ran to credit, LBO partnerships raised debt against conglomerates with fewer NOCs and divestment incentives.\nSince helping found <italic>National Venture Capital Association</italic> in 1973, <italic>Warburg Pincus</italic>\u2019 Pincus negotiated with Labor Department to promote LBOs and VC. As post-TA1969 high capital gains taxes stymied entrepreneurship, tax-privileged pension managers avoided VC because of loss liability under ERISA.  liberalized NOCs more to disincentivize mergers but postponed TA1976\u2019s NOC trafficking ban to 1980. \nAnd as Carter began unwinding <italic>New Deal</italic>-era regulated cartels, he reduced the scope of federal monopoly. TA1978 decreased capital gains and eased write-offs for original holders of worthless shares to foster small businesses. Moreover, a revised ERISA clarified diversifying with risky assets was \u2018prudent\u2019 after lobbying from Stanley Golder and Jack Levin. As VCs raised more funds, they disbursed them through partnerships. \nUnlike conglomerates and closed-end funds, these had predefined exit times and tax-passthrough, allowing tax-free investors to bypass corporate taxes, taxable investors to harvest losses, and entrepreneurs to realize more upside. By 1980, IPOs grew faster than mergers as funds replaced conglomerates. While some VCs adopted oil and gas tax shelter-like partnerships in the 1960s, these were the norm in the 1980s. \nOn the same day as TA1978, Congress fused corporate and partnership bankruptcy with . BA1978 privatized bankruptcy, giving equity investors a say in corporate reorgs while continuing to prevent debt discharge and NOC trafficking. So, taxes became the difference for limited liability partners due to nonrecourse debt. Though both were subject to cramdowns, corporate reorgs favored ESOPs and equity. Since this put creditors at a disadvantage, they favored partnerships instead.\nAs banks and LICs shifted to secured and shorter credit, they lent KKR secured LBO bridge financing, senior loans, and subordinated private placements. LBOs multiplied as tiered leverage allowed KKR to purchase a <italic>Fortune 500</italic> corporation in 1978. Unlike conglomerates, LBOs organized VC-like partnerships with defined lives and passthrough taxes. After TA1976 taxed divestitures, conglomerate management could neither sell NOCs nor deduct debt interest and became takeover targets. \nAs inflation raised asset values above historical cost, old owners were liable for capital gains taxes on sales. Since GUD did not tax liquidating sell-offs at the corporate level, LBOs restructured operations more tax-efficiently. Still, VC raised more. As Congress deregulated inflationary business and energy monopolies, OPEC\u2019s oil embargo triggered energy inflation in early 1979. To promote domestic oil investment, Congress started deregulating PUHC, oil, and gas\u2014but delayed profit taxes\u2014spurring energy partnerships to pass through tax shelter NOCs. \nFRS warned banks against speculation and subjected LBO bridges to reserves during their disinflation. Instead of slowing, takeovers accelerated as banks\u2019 retreat from risk led the market to CSFB\u2019s advanced bridges without banks and DBL\u2019s <italic>high-yield bonds</italic> (\u201cHYB\u201d). While low-rated corporations traded from \u2018fallen angel\u2019 corporations, DBL\u2019s Michael Milken marketed low-rated bonds at issue against tradition. He designed HYB to trade like low-tax equity instead of illiquid bank loans and private debt, allowing LICs to manage liquidity and issuers to finance operations and refinance bank loans.\nHaving fled Russian pogroms, the Milkevitz family moved to Wisconsin. Being orphaned at an early age, Bernard Milkevitz worked to pay for his studies at <italic>Uni Wisconsin</italic> before marrying into the more affluent Midwestern Zax family and changed his surname to Milken. As Bernard\u2019s son Michael graduated <italic>Wharton</italic> and joined DBL, Michael\u2019s cousin Stanley Zax earned a law degree from <italic>Michigan Uni</italic> and Counsel for <italic>Hilton Hotels</italic>. By the late 1970s, Zax became Chair of <italic>Zenith</italic> <italic>Insurance</italic> in California, while Bernard grew sick. Driven by his father\u2019s illness, Michael relocated to Los Angeles to be near his family. Alongside Milken, DBL hired Leon Black, the son of Eli Blachowitz \u201cBlack\u201d\u2014a 10th generation rabbi who joined <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2014who later became Chief of M&A. \nAlong with Zax\u2019s <italic>Zenith </italic>insurer and his hotel friends, Michael Milken sold HYB to other client-investors LICs in California and New York, including to his close friend Leo Walsh\u2019s <italic>Equitable</italic> and Fred Carr\u2019s <italic>Executive</italic>. Often client-investors were hostile corporate conglomerate \u2018raiders\u2019\u2014including Carl Icahn, Irwin Jacobs, Charles Bluhdorn, Carl Lindner, David Murdock, Victor Posner\u2014bought underpriced stocks and forced management to improve business, for the benefit of existing investors over management and employees. \nOne of the earliest purchasers of HYB was, Carl Lindner. A Baptist, Lindner began working in his family\u2019s Ohio dairy business and founded <italic>United Dairy Farmers</italic> in 1940 to innovate milk distribution. Through the 1950s, <italic>United Dairy Farmers</italic> expanded its operations, establishing numerous stores across Ohio. Simultaneously, in the late 1950s, Lindner establishing <italic>American Financial</italic> to diversify into insurance, banking, and real estate, acquiring <italic>Dempsey & Siders Agency</italic>, <italic>United Liberty Life</italic> in 1963, and <italic>Athens </italic>NB.\nDavid Murdock grew up in Wayne, Ohio, during the Great Depression, he dropped out of high school at 16 due to family financial strain, exacerbated by a fire that injured his mother. In 1942, during WWII, Murdock was drafted into the military and served until 1945. After leaving the service, he bought a small Detroit diner in 1947, selling it two years later. By 1950, he moved to Phoenix and started his homebuilding and real estate ventures, profiting in the postwar housing boom. After losing a large amount as the Phoenix real estate market collapsed in 1964, Murdock moved to Los Angeles. A year after gaining control of <italic>International Mining Corp</italic> in 1978, he became the largest stakeholder of <italic>Occidental Petroleum</italic>, until Aramand Hammer bought him out.\nOther prominent Milken client-investors were fellow Jews. Perhaps the most successful was Carl Icahn. Icahn, a variant of Kohen, was born in New York a lawyer and cantor at a local synagogue and studied philosophy at<italic> Princeton</italic>. Other client-investors had long histories. Victor Posner, born to Russian immigrants, dropped out of school at 13 to work in his parents\u2019 Baltimore grocery store during the Great Depression. Using his earnings, he invested in affordable housing, selling homes below market rates while retaining land ownership. By 25, he had built a real estate empire and ventured into Florida in the mid-1950s, acquiring oceanfront properties through <italic>Security Management</italic>. Employing aggressive tactics, Posner executed hostile takeovers of various public companies.\nAnother, Irwin Jacobs, born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and assisted his Russian-born father in the burlap sack resale business during his youth. At a young age, in the late 1950s or early 1960s, Jacobs purchased 300 pairs of skis at an auction for $13 each and successfully resold them at a profit. In 1974, he invested in the struggling <italic>Grain Belt</italic> beer company, attempting to revive the brand. Facing difficulties, he closed the brewery and sold the brand to <italic>Heileman Brewing</italic> in the mid-1970s. By 1980, Jacobs acquired more strategic stakes.\nFinally, Raymond Perelman, born to Lithuanian immigrants, grew up witnessing his father\u2019s endeavors in the scrap business. After serving as a flight officer in WWII, Raymond graduated from <italic>Wharton</italic>. He expanded his family\u2019s business by adding a plant in North Carolina, and eventually delved into the metals industry, acquiring<italic> Belmont Iron</italic> in 1960, which became a significant steel-fabricating company on the East Coast. \nOver the years, Perelman continued to acquire distressed companies, including <italic>Esslinger Brewery</italic> and <italic>General Refractories</italic>, employing strategies to revitalize them or liquidate assets for profit. While his son Ronald initially worked in his father\u2019s company, <italic>Belmont Industries</italic>. In 1978, at the age of 35, Ronald resigned and moved to New York. He started his ascent by purchasing a 40% stake in <italic>Cohen-Hatfield Industries</italic>. In 1980, Ronald acquired <italic>MacAndrews Forbes</italic>, dating back to 1850. Subsequently, through strategic maneuvers like divesting non-core parts of companies, he increased their profitability.\nLikewise, new blood transformed <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic>. Since selling a 22% stake to Saudi Arabian investors in the 1970s, the company sold herself to <italic>Equitable</italic> LIC in 1984. In the meantime, Hamilton James took over the M&A department and then formed a merchant bank to invest in LBOs. Born to the Chair of <italic>Arthur Little</italic> International, James studied at <italic>Choate</italic>, <italic>Harvard</italic>, and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business. While <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette </italic>was not in the same league as <italic>Goldman</italic> or CSFB, James helped <italic>Federated</italic> to takeover <italic>Children</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Place</italic> in 1981 before lounging into HYB and LBOs after 1985 to become second only to DBL.\nTo tax soaring oil profits, Congress limited GUD\u2019s tax-free liquidations in 1980. As the <italic>Panic of 1979</italic> unfolded, DOJ relaxed her stance against mergers and, in early 1981, <italic> </italic>(\u201cBT81\u201d) allowed for tax-free debt discharge via stock-for-debt swaps and bankruptcy. While the bankruptcy exception reduced NOCs, it promoted mergers for a fresh start. BT81 taxed solvent firms for refunding inflated debt and extended tax-free stock-for-debt swaps to solvent partnerships. This tax arbitrage incentivized oil corporates and tax shelters to consolidate. \nLarger oil corporates merged as GUD permitted tax-free stock redemptions and partial liquidations without capital gains. Since high-interest rates increased cash flows, firms issued reduced cash flow bonds (\u201cRCFs\u201d) to write off taxes. Instead of taxing partnerships as corporates, Congress curbed shelters and mergers with . TA1981 liberalized capital gains and NOCs\u2014and postponed TA1976\u2019s trafficking ban to 1982. While TA1981\u2019s accelerated depreciation and installment sales supported mergers\u2014as non-debt tax shields increased cash flow for debt service\u2014TA1981\u2019s monetized leases promoted NOCs sales over merging.\nMeanwhile, growing bank and S&L insolvency threatened federal insurance. So, S&L\u2019s regulator, FHS, funded troubled S&Ls acquisitions. Since UST and FRS required banks to hold assets at historical cost in 1938, S&L capital-to-asset ratios collapsed after inflation. Unlike FDIC, Congress and FHS and FSLIC encouraged insolvent but liquid S&L mergers as <italic>regulatory accounting practices</italic> (\u201cRAP\u201d) replaced capital with merger goodwill. \nSimilarly, TA1981 modified BA1978 to add BT81 benefits for S&Ls mergers and privileged real estate to boost revenues, while FRS and DOJ revised merger guidelines. As non-real estate tax shelters grew,  eliminated LICs\u2019 deferred annuity tax shelters, several went bankrupt, and survivors sold more to tax-exempt pensions and invested in HYB to manage liquidity. In addition, TA1982 repealed TA1981\u2019s lease monetization to cinch corporate tax shelters. Finally, TA1982 postponed TA1976\u2019s NOC trafficking ban to 1984\u2014along with liberalized lease rules\u2014and revised <italic>S-corps</italic> as UST renounced taxing partnerships at corporate rates. \nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1982</italic>, DA1982 funded FDIC and FSLIC to resuscitate banks and S&Ls with mergers. By 1983, over a quarter of S&Ls consolidated before subsiding as the industry recovered. Similarly, DA1982 encouraged S&L joint-ventures and privatizations\u2014resulting in an IPO boom\u2014and expanded allowable activities to include nonrecourse loans, direct investments, HYB, and financing via brokered deposits. DA1982 spurred California to deregulate. Meanwhile, TA1981\u2019s tax-deferred installments incentivized real estate developers to bypass S&Ls via residential mortgage bonds (\u201cRMBS\u201d) innovated by <italic>Salomon</italic>\u2019s Lewis Ranieri and popularized by CSFB\u2019s Larry Fink, <italic>Kidder</italic>, and other securities bankers.\nSo, S&Ls engaged in joint ventures and accounted for these direct investments as debt before syndication. DBL financed S&L conversions in California, which balanced these liabilities by investing in short-term HYB and direct real estate investments. Along with buying S&Ls after DA1982, <italic>Hyatt</italic>\u2019s Pritzker family bought <italic>Ticketmaster</italic> and the troubled <italic>Braniff</italic> <italic>Air</italic> by 1983. They also diversified into numerous industries, including <italic>McCall</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s magazine, <italic>Levitz Furniture</italic>, and casinos in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe, and Atlantic City. Jay Pritzker gained recognition as a prominent corporate raider of the 1980s, including a failed takeover of IT&T.\nMoreover, deregulation diluted the division of Jewish and White Anglo-Saxon Protestant bankers. While Greek Pete Peterson became Chair of <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic> and named Lewis Glucksman co-CEO in 1983, conflict drove Peterson out, with Glucksman poorly leading the firm. Having bought <italic>Safra</italic>\u2019s <italic>Trade Development Bank of Switzerland</italic> , <italic>American Express Shearson</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic> acquired <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic> in 1984 and forced Glucksman out. Likewise, <italic>Warburg</italic> London\u2014Britain\u2019s largest Jewish bank along with <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2014had named Protestant David Scholey Deputy Chair in 1977 and Chair in 1980.\nOn the other hand, also in 1983, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Guaranty</italic> promoted Boris Berkovitch to Vice Chair, who became <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s first senior Jewish executive. Similarly, <italic>Citi</italic> appointed Lawrence Small to lead its corporate banking division in 1985, and Robert Lipp became one of three presidents at <italic>Chemical </italic>in 1983. At <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic>, Ernest Stein (general counsel) and Martin Zuckerman (personnel) were promoted to Executive VPs in 1985. \nAlan Fishman became Senior Executive VP in charge of investment banking at <italic>Chemical</italic>. At <italic>Chase</italic>, Anthony Terracciano, an Italian-American, was promoted to Vice Chair in 1985, while Peter Palmieri, also of Italian descent, became Vice Chair of <italic>Irving Trust</italic> in 1984. Armenian-American Ira Stepanian rose to the presidency of <italic>Bank of Boston</italic>, where Barry Allen served as First VP. Arthur Ryan, a second-generation Irish-American, became a Vice Chair at <italic>Chase</italic> in 1985. Still, few women, Black, or Hispanic individuals had reached the highest banking positions.\nMeanwhile, IBM began developing its personal computer in 1980. While IBM contracted <italic>Microsoft</italic> to develop software, VC-funded <italic>Apple</italic> went public led by <italic>Hambrecht</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, and others. By 1982, <italic>Kleiner Perkins</italic> VC partnered with <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> to raise a record VC fund, soon funding including <italic>Sun Microsystems</italic>, <italic>Cypress Semiconductor</italic>, <italic>Compaq</italic>, and <italic>Lotus Development</italic>. That year, as President Reagan reversed antitrust policy, DOJ dropped her longstanding case against IBM. \nAmong the many new entrants was Michael Dell, who began selling IBM-compatible personal computers from his dorm at <italic>Uni </italic><italic>of Texas</italic> at Austin, and by 1984 earned $80,000 per month and incorporated <italic>Dell</italic>. While his mother was the granddaughter of Jewish refugees from Russian Lithuania in 1906, she became the first female broker at <italic>Paine Webber</italic>\u2019s Houston office in the 1970s and her uncle, William Langfan, became wealthy converting apartments from the 1960s.\nWith greater competition, <italic>Microsoft</italic> hired <italic>Goldman</italic> to lead an IPO with <italic>Hambrecht, Lazard</italic>, and other securities firms by 1985. (Two years later, Bill Gates and his lawyer father, funded the MBO of Seattle\u2019s <italic>Starbucks</italic> coffee.) <italic>Merrill</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s investment chief Jerome Kenney, meanwhile, invested in <italic>Salomon</italic> trader Michael Bloomberg\u2019s investment-focused computer system, <italic>Bloomberg</italic>. \nBut LBOs became more attractive without lease monetization as remaining non-debt tax shields produced cash flows for debt service. Combined with GUD\u2019s reduced capital gains liability, TA1981\u2019s accelerated depreciation hastened sales, especially as tax-deferred installments. Although TA1982 ended GUD\u2019s partial liquidations, redemptions, and RCFs developed in 1981, TA1982 privileged control changed as liquidations were tax-free. \nSimilarly, TA1982 only limited public RCFs, so firms sold privately to tax-exempt firms. In liquidation, GUD allowed debt repayment with pre-tax gains. Corporates had less use for debt tax deductions because of TA1981\u2019s non-debt tax shields, and investors demanded equity because of low capital gains. With NOC-laden conglomerates deleveraging tax-free due to BT81, GUD enabled LBOs to pay a premium as they planned to liquidate. To defend against hostile takeovers, managers merged, purchased stock, and privatized in LBOs. \nBanks began financing KKR\u2019s LBOs without private debt cushions and LBOs grew as a share of mergers. While non-financial companies were able to merge, states began obstructing hostile takeovers with anti-takeover laws following the <italic>Williams Act</italic>. In 1982, the Court derailed these efforts by ruling Illinois\u2019 anti-takeover law unconstitutional in favor of MITE. \nMITE, a hardware machinery manufacturer founded in 1953 by the Blinken family, had strong connections to <italic>Warburg</italic> London and <italic>Warburg Pincus</italic>. Moreover, Congress postponed implementing TA1969\u2019s hybrid security rule, and\u2014after <italic>Goldman </italic>innovated unacceptably but within the guidelines\u2014Congress withdrew the regulation in mid-1983. Without a bright-line test against indebtedness, DBL\u2019s HYB and similar instruments proliferated, like PUs leveraged preferred equity.\nWith acquisition cheaper than drilling, oil mergers boomed. As Congress debated CP and repo reform, SEC eased shelf requirements for CP direct to MMMFs sales\u2014allowing for longer maturity CP\u2014and private security registration with <italic>Reg D</italic>\u2014fueling tax shelter partnerships. Since<italic> </italic>GUD allowed tax-free liquidations, corporate oil equity traded at a discount to tradable partnerships\u2014royalty trusts like Boone Pickens\u2019 <italic>Mesa</italic> LP\u2014subject to personal tax. \nIn 1983, DBL financed private investor Carl Icahn\u2019s hostile bid for <italic>Phillip</italic> <italic>Oil Corp</italic> to liquidate it into a royalty trust. Instead of slow bond sales and bank loans that leak details, DBL issued a <italic>highly confident letter</italic> committing to sufficient HYB. Although this LBO failed, the raider profited and paid a low long-term capital tax rate by selling on a tax-deferred installment to NOC-heavy<italic> PENN</italic> <italic>Central</italic>. \nCongress ended the boom and made it easier for takeovers to compete with old owners . TA1984 limited GUD\u2019s tax-free liquidations, BT81\u2019s exemption of stock for debt tax for solvent firms,  and installment tax benefits, leveraged preferred equity, and RCFs. But TA1984 postponed TA1976\u2019s ban on NOC trafficking to 1986 and TA1982\u2019s liberalized leases to 1988. VCs no longer raised more than LBOs after 1984. \nSince starting <italic>Matrix</italic> VC, Fred Hellman, started <italic>Hellman Friedman</italic> LBO in San Francisco<italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>Another heir, entered VC. General William Draper Jr\u2019s grandson Tim Draper graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> Business in 1984 and joined <italic>Alex.Brown</italic> for two years before founding his own VC, <italic>Draper</italic>, with funds from SBA. However, he experienced losses for several years and SBA nearly withdrew funds.\nAnd, as the Court struck down collective bargaining agreements, TA1984 advanced ESOPs\u2014with debt tax deductions and equity capital gains exemptions\u2014but employee LBOs were marginal. After <italic>National Steel</italic> sought to close West Virginia\u2019s <italic>Weirton Steel </italic>in 1982, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Keilin advised the record ESOP in 1984. Since purchasing <italic>Cannon Mills</italic> in an LBO in 1982, David Murdock issuing debt, dismissing 2,000 workers, and selling housing assets. Before selling to rival <italic>Fieldcrest Mills</italic> in 1986, Murdock terminated <italic>Cannon</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>pension plan, and bought high-yield annuities for <italic>Cannon</italic> employees from <italic>Executive</italic> LIC.\nWhile thousands of regional stockbrokers sold IPOs to individuals, <italic>Goldman </italic>began selling blocks to institutions in 1984. But DBL\u2019s fast <italic>highly confident letter</italic> revolutionized LBOs among a group of DBL\u2019s client-investors. While DBL financed several profitable hostile bids, bank loans financed most hostile bids, with HYB primarily financed operations and refinanced bank loans. Aside from several California and Texas S&Ls, most held small amounts of HYB for diversification. One of the many industries DBL helped reorg was the entertainment industry. \nAt the time, companies changed with management and control. Back in 1980, Walt Disney\u2019s son-in-law Ronald Miller was appointed President and COO in 1980 to revitalize the company. Before becoming CEO by 1983, Miller established <italic>Touchstone Pictures</italic> for adult-targeted films and <italic>Disney Channel</italic>, while progressing plans for a theme park in France. \nUsing <italic>National Amusements</italic>, Sumner Redstone accumulated 5% of <italic>Fox</italic> in 1977 after <italic>Star Wars</italic>, followed by 10% of <italic>Columbia</italic> in 1980. By 1981 he sold <italic>Fox</italic> shares to oil magnate Marvin Davis sold most of his oil and natural gas holdings during the market peak, and partnered with oil trader Marc Rich to buy <italic>Fox</italic>. Also in 1981, MGM bought <italic>United Artists</italic> from <italic>TransAmerica </italic>LIC.\nAfter being fired by <italic>Allen</italic> from <italic>Columbia</italic>, Alan Hirschfield consulted for <italic>Warner</italic>. By 1979, Marvin Davis named Hirschfield Vice Chair and COO of <italic>Fox</italic>, and CEO. <italic>Allen</italic> and <italic>National Amusements</italic> sold <italic>Columbia</italic> to <italic>Coca Cola</italic> by 1982. As Charles Bluhdorn died in early 1983, his long-time associate Martin Davis (of unknown relation to Marvin Davis) stepped into the role of Vice Chair and CEO of <italic>Gulf+Western</italic>. Immediately, Davis divested the cigar and sugar holdings, the old <italic>Madison Square Garden</italic>, and consumer and industrial products. Alongside, he bought <italic>Esquire</italic>, <italic>Prentice-Hall</italic>, and <italic>Glen & Co, </italic>focusing on entertainment and financial services.\nBy May 1984, DBL financed Saul Steinberg\u2019s hostile bid for <italic>Disney</italic>. After CEO Ronald Miller bought community and resort and developer <italic>Arvida </italic>for $200 million in stock to thwart potential takeover attempts, he paid an extra $30 million when buying Steinberg\u2019s shares for $325 million to protect management. While disgruntled shareholders soon sued <italic>Disney</italic> for corporate waste,  Miller bid for <italic>Gibson Greetings</italic> until dropping it under threat of another raid from DBL sponsored Irwin Jacobs. \nBy September 1984, Alan Hirschfield resigned from <italic>Fox</italic>, setting off a chain reaction. As Barry Diller resigned as <italic>Paramount</italic>\u2019s CEO and Chair to lead <italic>Fox</italic>, <italic>Disney</italic> forced Miller to resign, and replaced him with Diller\u2019s long-time second-in-command, <italic>Paramount</italic> President Michael Eisner. Within months, Davis sold <italic>Fox</italic> to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s <italic>News Corp</italic>, focusing instead on California real estate. \nBy late 1985, Larry Tisch sold <italic>Loew</italic> movie theaters and a large interest in CBS, gaining a board seat and the presidency. After issuing debt to defend against potential hostile takeovers, <italic>Viacom</italic> reported losses and became a takeover target. When Carl Icahn and an MBO failed, Sumner Redstone\u2019s <italic>National Amusements</italic> bought the company by March 1986. Within months, Congress deregulated cable, and <italic>Viacom</italic> assets soared. Only in 1989 did legal battles between <italic>Disney</italic> shareholders and <italic>Disney</italic> and Steinberg\u2019s <italic>Reliance</italic> concluded with a final settlement of $45 million. (By then, the children of Steinberg and Tisch wed in 1988.)\nDBL sought to reorg the post-boom oil conglomerates. From 1980, <italic>Phillips Petroleum</italic>, under William Douce\u2019s leadership, witnessed a resurgence with notable ventures: a 1982 joint exploration with <italic>Chevron</italic> in the Santa Maria Basin, followed by the acquisition of <italic>General American Oil Co</italic> in 1983 to counter a takeover bid from Boone Pickens\u2019 <italic>Mesa</italic> LP. Further bolstering its assets, <italic>Phillips</italic> acquired <italic>Aminoil</italic> <italic>Corp</italic> and <italic>Geysers Geothermal Co</italic> from conglomerate RJR in 1984. \nHowever, by late 1984, <italic>Mesa</italic> LP commenced a takeover attempt, acquiring a 5.7% stake in <italic>Phillips</italic>. This incited legal battles and restructuring that incurred substantial costs and debt. In early 1985, DBL sponsored Carl Icahn, Irwin Jacobs, and Ivan Boesky, launching a $4.2 billion offer for a controlling stake in <italic>Phillips</italic>. Responding with a $62 per share debt exchange plan, <italic>Phillips</italic> navigated these challenges, leading to CJ Silas succeeding Douce as Chair by May 1985, initiating a restructuring process that coincided with a steep fall in oil prices by yearend, leading to asset sales and layoffs.\nWhile Congress did not implement TA1969\u2019s anti-conglomerate hybrid securities regulation after the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>, debate to link HYB taxation to firm indebtedness under TA1969 resumed from 1985 amidst takeover scandals. And as FRS scrutinized LBOs, banks required more subordinate debt cushions, and HYB filled that gap. Moreover, foreigners favored RCFs as TA1984 eliminated withholding taxes, but gains were tax-free until 1986. While TA1984 limited RMBS\u2019 installment benefit, Congress permitted S&Ls and banks to invest in RMBS, and  boosted commercial real estate lease security. For profit-driven S&Ls, direct investments were more attractive. FHS tried to reign in S&L growth by limiting the use of DA1982-allowed brokered deposits, but a court blocked this. \nUnable to cut financing, FHS turned her attention to direct investments. Despite criticism from Alan Greenspan, FHS implemented restrictions on brokered deposits and direct investments in early 1985. The run from S&Ls in California commenced immediately and, along with the <italic>Panic of 1984</italic>\u2014which FHS did little to ease\u2014hobbled FSLIC and FDIC. Rather than reclassify the loans, FHS accused the S&Ls of fraud and chastised accountants. Likewise, FHS and Congress scrutinized HYB as one of California\u2019s failed S&Ls with high direct investment was a DBL client-investor with a tiny HYB loss. \nA similar situation transpired in agriculture. During the political restructuring of 1978, Congress amended <italic>Farm Credit System</italic> (\u201cFCS\u201d) to extend moratoria to farmers. However, they soon reversed course. At the same time, BA1978 reduced the scope of farmers exempt from involuntary bankruptcy and jeopardized financing by holding warehouse grain recipes subject to the automatic stay. As France\u2019s ECGD guaranteed export loans, Congress eased ECGD for CCC and EXIM<italic> </italic>in 1979. \nStill, Midwestern farms suffered as FRS rate hikes and TA1981 collapsed exports. BA1978\u2019s accompanying tax law (\u201cBT81\u201d) also disadvantaged farmers receiving moratoria without filing for bankruptcy. A vicious cycle developed as farmers defaulted on loans while private lenders\u2014unable to recoup collateral\u2014contracted credit or failed, further depressing land prices and exacerbating the insolvency cycle. After the Administration defunded the 1978 agricultural moratoria program for bailing out large farmers, Congressional price subsidies and TA1981\u2019s depreciation stimulated farming tax shelters. \nAs in neighboring states, Nebraska saw insolvent farmers and bankrupt grain warehouses. When other states deregulated banks after the <italic>Panic of 1980</italic>, Nebraska limited direct real estate investments that S&L-like industrial loan companies had been allowed to make for decades. In 1982, a statewide referendum banned corporate farming. Despite bank suits, the Court upheld the law. By 1983, the state\u2019s young private deposit insurance system collapsed and required a bailout. \n supported farmers by exempting warehouse grain receipts from the automatic stay. However, the courts ordered Congress to resume the 1978 moratoria by the end of the year. As FCS charge-offs of these loans rivaled losses from FDIC and FSLIC, banks followed suit and failed in droves\u2014further depressing available credit and land prices in the heartland states.  \nAmidst the crisis at FDIC, President Ronald Reagan appointed <italic>Seidman</italic>\u2019s William Seidman as the first Jewish FDIC Chair in 1985. Seidman was born in Michigan to one of <italic>Seidman</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>co-founders. He graduated from <italic>Dartmouth</italic> in economics in 1943, served as an ensign in the Navy during WWII. After the war, Seidman received a law degree from <italic>Harvard</italic> Law and an MBA from <italic>Uni of Michigan</italic> before joining <italic>Seidman</italic> in 1949, becoming a full partner in 1954 and Managing Partner in 1968. \nUnder his leadership, the firm became one of the ten largest accounting firms in America. He ran for Michigan state auditor general in 1962 on George Romney\u2019s ticket but lost. He later worked as a special assistant to Romney and as a management and budget consultant for VP Gerald Ford. After Ford became president in 1974, Seidman was appointed executive director of <italic>Economic Policy Board</italic> and served as the President\u2019s Assistant for Economic Affairs until 1977. Following his time in Washington, he became Vice Chair and CFO of <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic>.\nAfter allowing forbearance with <italic>regulatory accounting practices</italic> (\u201cRAP\u201d) for some of her 37 banks, FCS sought bailouts by 1985. So, Congress sanctioned RAP in 1986, chartered the UST-guaranteed <italic>Financial Assistance Corp</italic> to refinance FCS and the <italic>Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp</italic> (\u201cFarmer Mac\u201d) to monetize farming debt. While Congress significantly increased farm subsidies with price supports, they BA1978 in 1986 to allow farmers to retain property with<italic> Chapter 12</italic>. \nWhile  protected solvent farmers from penalties, <italic>Chapter 12</italic> privileged debtors. Few farmers filed as banks modified loans. Courts blocked foreclosures, and charge-offs eased. With deleveraging complete, farming investment recovered as Federal-guarantees\u2014and lender-owned trust deeds in Nebraska\u2014replaced farm mortgages loans. While several states eased anti-corporate laws, subsidies continue to reduce competition from developing countries and innovation, often wasting resources.\nAmong these crises, AIDS silently ravaged America\u2019s gay community. Like Jews that left their religion or practiced in secret, even elite LGBT did not feel comfortable about fully acknowledging themselves publicly. As <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic>\u2019s co-founder Richard Jenrette concealed his long-term relationship with William Thompson for decades amidst a culture of homophobia, DBL\u2019s Leon Lambert remained closeted, even after he died from AIDS-related complications in 1987.\n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of </italic><italic>1986, </italic><italic>1987</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> & 1989</italic>\nAfter capping federal nuclear tort liabilities in the wake of the <italic>Panic of 1953</italic>, Congress did not lift them when privatizing nuclear energy in 1964. While federal taxes made Eastern coal unattractive, nuclear subsidies promoted nuclear facilities, like <italic>Three Mile Island</italic> in Pennsylvania in 1974. Following an accident there in 1979, Congress\u2019 deadline for the extension beyond 1987 lapsed in late 1983. Despite concerns about excessive and largely unregulated tax-free municipal debt after WSPPS, Congress took no action. Congress similarly ended subsidies for general torts. \nWith , Congress expanded the federal bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction to related civil proceedings, including domestic relations, torts, and other contingent injuries. In addition, without applying the automatic stay to alimony, BA1978 dropped the insolvency requirement for the automatic stay from secured creditors and tort claimants to foster reorgs. The first shock came in 1982 as an asbestos firm proactively filed for bankruptcy as product liability lawsuits threatened her solvency. Breaking with tradition, the court ruled that liability insurance was for the benefit of the estate rather than tort claimants. \nSo, in addition to stockholders, liability insurance became valuable to creditors. These insurers, <italic>property & casualty insurance companies</italic> (\u201cPCICs\u201d), faced the worst insurance crisis since 1906. PCICs had deducted undiscounted loss reserves from taxable income and bought reinsurance against payouts. The largest captive insurers were <italic>Walton</italic> (<italic>Phillips Petroleum</italic>), <italic>Bellefonte</italic> (<italic>Armco</italic>), <italic>Altamid</italic> and <italic>Erieview</italic> (<italic>COALH</italic>), <italic>Bluefield</italic> (<italic>Mobil</italic>), and <italic>Lakeside</italic> (<italic>Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co</italic>). \nReinsurer partnerships could charge low premia by domiciling in offshore tax havens, mainly the Bahamas and Cayman Islands. TA1984 ended this by taxing offshore reinsurers, which raised premiums. Congress signaled they would soon require reserve discounting to raise taxes. While banks, S&Ls, and LICs faced similar restrictions, they had other tax shields. So PCICs increased reserves while they still could. Their primary expense was legal fees as creditors joined tort claimants. \nWith premiums soaring, most states reformed torts. But not Texas. As BA1978 recast tort damages into contracts, corporate control disputes moved from commercial to common law. With a low contracting bar, the booming financial system refocused on Texan real estate after the energy shocks of the 1970s and TA1981. In 1980, courts extended deceptive trade law to credit and, in 1984, ruled banks tortiously interfered by threatening bankruptcy for control change. \nWhile banks had been allowed to protect investments, this decision tightened credit by unleashing lender liability litigation. After <italic>Getty Oil</italic> contracted to buy<italic> Pennzoil</italic>, <italic>Texaco</italic> took over <italic>Pennzoil</italic> with their advisors\u2014CSFB\u2019s Wasserstein and<italic> Lazard</italic>\u2019s Glanville\u2014support. By 1985, a Texan court held <italic>Texaco</italic> had tortiously interfered in breaking a merger contract. As claimants seized assets, creditors ran from <italic>Texaco</italic>. America\u2019s trade deficit led her to depreciate the <italic>dollar</italic> with Japan in 1985. \nBy early 1974, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Smith Barney</italic>, <italic>Harriman</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic> raised a <italic>BANK</italic> loan for Denmark to modernize her PUs. Since coalers struck in the <italic>Panic of 1974, </italic>British de-industrialization hastened. As BOE rescued <italic>Burmah</italic> tanker with <italic>British Petroleum</italic> (\u201cBP\u201d) stock, <italic>Exchequer</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>BP stake grew from 50 to 68%, Parliament nationalized North Sea oil into <italic>Britoil</italic> with fixed long-term contract prices. After requesting an IMF loan in 1976, Britain\u2019s Energy Department hired <italic>Rothschild</italic> to advise on selling BP shares. Despite<italic> Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic>\u2019s Verey being on BP\u2019s board and <italic>Lazard </italic>London being the preferred advisor, <italic>Exchequer</italic> chose <italic>Warburg</italic>\u2019s David Scholey to sell her 17% BP stake, who then  became <italic>Warburg</italic>\u2019s Deputy Chair in 1977 and Chair in 1980.\nWhile <italic>Britoil</italic> profits buoyed <italic>Exchequer</italic> in the <italic>Panic of 1979</italic>, investment stalled. As American conglomerated and Japan cartelized as steel deflated, strikes led Britain and France to stop subsidizing steel and Britain elected opposition leader Margert Thatcher as the first female PM. Thatcher\u2019s earliest backer was <italic>Cazenove</italic>\u2019s Michael Rougemont Richardson, who supported privatization, and soon became her favorite banker. While his relation to Gordon Richardson of <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> and BOE is unknown, his mother was a Huguenot Rougemont affiliated with <italic>Lloyd</italic> Insurer for generations<italic>.</italic>\nAs Thatcher\u2019s abolished exchange controls in 1979, she signaled banking deregulation. Ending exchange controls, PM Thatcher allowed LBOs to use company funds to buy shares. As she hired <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s MacGregor, a Scot, to privatize, coalers struck with cut labor and pension subsidies. Similar cuts sought to rationalize the car manufacture <italic>British Leyland</italic>. By 1980, Britain\u2019s <italic>Midland</italic> <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> bought <italic>Crocker</italic> NB. \nAs post-FA1933 <italic>Morgan</italic>,<italic> Morgan Stanley</italic>, and<italic> Morgan Grenfell</italic>, competed for MMEU in the 1970s, <italic>Morgan </italic>sold her <italic>Grenfell</italic> stake to British allies because of Thatcher\u2019s takeover law in 1979, leaving <italic>Lloyd</italic>\u2019s insurance broker <italic>Willis Faber</italic> as chief shareholder. Back in 1967, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>\u2019s Chair William Burns Harcourt appointed John Stevens as Chief Executive. Stevens had been Executive Director of BOE since 1957, after serving as Director of the European Department at IMF afterward. Stevens recruited his wife\u2019s cousin, Bill Mackworth-Young, a descendant of Francis Baring\u2019s brother, and Chris Reeves, an alum of BOE and <italic>Hill Samuel</italic>. \nFollowing the unexpected death of John Stevens in 1973, Stephen Catto\u2014who followed his father into <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> in 1948 and became a partner in 1957\u2014became Chair of <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> in 1973 with Mackworth-Young. Since Reeves became a director in 1970, his sister-in-law married Winston Churchill\u2019s cousin twice removed by 1976. Reeves was appointed Chief Executive in 1980, a year before <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> severed her link with <italic>Morgan Guaranty</italic>. With the death of Mackworth-Young in 1984, Reeves became Joint Chair and Deputy Chair with Catto.\nDominating British colonial trade since WWI, the Scottish Geddes and Anderson clan saw <italic>Sumitomo</italic> take over <italic>Dunlop</italic> in 1981. Donald Anderson\u2019s son-in-law, David Loehnis, a fifth great nephew of James Coutts, began his career in the 1960s with the British Diplomatic Service until joining <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg </italic>in 1967. Since leaving <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> to govern BOE, Gordon Richardson seconded Loehnis in 1977 for a <italic>London Stock Exchange </italic>enquiry until 1979. In 1980, Loehnis returned to BOE as Associate Director for Overseas operations, becoming Executive Director from 1981. \nAs Anthony Forbes, of unknown relation to other Forbes families, became joint Senior Partner of <italic>Cazenove</italic> from 1980, his brother-in-law Chair of <italic>NatWest</italic>, Robin Leigh-Pemberton\u2014a gentry aristocrat descended from the Drummond and Touche banking families of Scotland and Ireland\u2014joined the Court of BOE and then replaced Gordon Richardson, becoming the first clearing banker to lead BOE. By then, Leigh-Pemberton\u2019s son James worked at <italic>Warburg</italic> London in corporate finance. \nSince <italic>Paribas</italic> <italic>Warburg</italic> acquired <italic>Becker</italic> in 1974, <italic>Paribas</italic> acquired <italic>Warburg</italic>\u2019s stake in 1984. While <italic>Warburg</italic> preferred to employ full-time financiers, <italic>Rothschild</italic> often employed conservative politicians in merchant banking and asset management, like Norman Lamont, to assist in explaining losses to clients. In contrast, <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic> hired left-leaning politicians. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> helped privatize Chile\u2019s electricity, Spain\u2019s oil, Singapore\u2019s water, Jamaica\u2019s national bank, and Turkey\u2019s paper<italic>, Kleinwort Benson</italic> did so for <italic>British Aerospace</italic>, <italic>Cable & Wireless</italic>, <italic>Enterprise Oil</italic>, and <italic>British Telecom </italic>in the 1980s. \nIn response to deregulation, Jacob Rothschild, head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, wanted to compete with <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic> by going public and merging with <italic>Warburg</italic>. Jacob\u2019s cousin Evelyn, son of the previous head, convinced the family to retain control over expansion. So, Jacob left <italic>Rothschild</italic> London to start RIT in 1980. Jacob Together with Saul Steinberg\u2019s <italic>Reliance</italic>, RIT took over British insurers. Since Steinberg restructured <italic>Leasco</italic> into <italic>Reliance</italic> LIC in the 1970s, he took his <italic>Reliance</italic> LIC private by 1981. The same year, the Rothschilds rebranded the American <italic>New Court Securities </italic>after acquiring full control.\nBack in 1978, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris merged with her bank and parent HC, <italic>Co du Nord</italic>. By 1982, Evelyn formed Swiss-domiciled <italic>Rothschild Continuation</italic> to unify disparate family interests, including RIT, which dominated returns. Following the dispute, Evelyn hired Michael Rougemont Richardson\u2014whom <italic>Cazenove</italic> passed over for CEO\u2014to originate deals. Joining <italic>Rothschild</italic> as Managing Director\u2014and, later, Vice Chair\u2014Richardson also advised Thatcher\u2019s <italic>Exchequer</italic> on privatizations. Richardson\u2019s cousin-in-law David Mayhew remained at <italic>Cazenove</italic>\u2014which also led British privatizations\u2014and later became Chair.\n<italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s transformation mirrored that of <italic>Lazard</italic>. After acquiring <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Priv\u00e9</italic>, which owned the remains of the 19th century mining bank <italic>Fould Oppenheim </italic>through <italic>Heine</italic> Paris, in 1973,<italic> Rothschild</italic> Paris invested in their first major industrial investment in American mining through <italic>Co du Nord</italic> in late 1975. While Andr\u00e9 Meyer\u2019s son became a physicist, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Felix Rohatyn liked deals and politics, and so refused to lead. Without sons, Michel Weill had four daughters. Long Rothschilds\u2019 neighbors in Frankfurt, the Sterns established <italic>Stern </italic>in 1823 to cater to French aristocracy. \nDuring WWII, Alice Goldschmidt Stern fled Paris with her children and took a job as a <italic>Bergdorf Goodman</italic> saleswoman in New York. After the war, the family returned to France, and Alice\u2019s son, Antoine, later took over <italic>Stern</italic>. By 1977, <italic>Stern</italic> was nearly bankrupt. With the help of Andr\u00e9 Meyer, Antoine\u2019s son, Eduardo, convinced his family to switch from selling <italic>Stern </italic>to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris to recruiting Francois Cari\u00e9s, the CEO of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris to chair <italic>Stern</italic> with Eduardo as Vice Chair. \nIn 1978, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris merged with her bank and parent HC, <italic>Co du Nord</italic>, to strengthen capital since the 1967 reorg. By 1982, <italic>Stern</italic>\u2019s revenues increased from $6 to 110 million. In 1984, he sold the bank to a Lebanese investor. And one of Michel Weill\u2019s daughters, Beatrice, married Eduardo. Felix Rohatyn\u2019s son Nicholas, meanwhile, joined <italic>Morgan </italic>in 1983. \nBy 1978, falling steel prices led French <italic>Wendel</italic> <italic>Sacilor</italic> and <italic>Usinor</italic> to lose five billion <italic>francs</italic>. So, the French government nationalized the steel industry and acquire 90% of <italic>Wendel</italic> <italic>Sacilor</italic>\u2019s equity. The Wendel family retained 10% and avoided bankruptcy as <italic>Paribas</italic> and other banks rescued the industry. Their non-steel assets were reorganized into CGIP, led by cousin Ernest-Antoine Seilli\u00e8re. Selling most companies, he kept <italic>Carnaud</italic>, and transformed CGIP into an IHC. CGIP invested in <italic>Cap Gemini</italic> in 1983, which continued acquisitions to become the world\u2019s fifth-largest IT services company by the decade\u2019s end. \nStill, Sidney Weinberg\u2019s son and other relatives inherited his clients and other roles at <italic>Goldman</italic>. Children also continued to guide Christian securities financiers. A descendant of Alex Brown, Ben Griswold chaired <italic>Alex.Brown</italic> in Baltimore.\nAfter <italic>Morgan </italic>partner Seymour Gilbert died in 1938, his widow married <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Harold Stanley. While Seymour\u2019s brother had become CEO of <italic>Gillette</italic> razor and his wife Boston Brahmin Chair of <italic>Harvard</italic>\u2019s female affiliate, <italic>Radcliffe</italic>, Seymour\u2019s son, Seymour Parker Jr, marred an <italic>OIL</italic> heiress Auchincloss, began his career at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> in 1960, making partner by 1969, and was elected Chair in 1984. Despite facing resistance from some senior partners concerned about the potential impact on the firm\u2019s culture, Gilbert successfully advocated for <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> to go public in 1986. \nLikewise, John Baring remained powerful. Born in 1928 Doris Burns Harcourt, a descendant of Junius Morgan, he commenced his career with <italic>Baring</italic> in 1950, swiftly rising to the position of Managing Director within five years. Serving as Chair for 15 years from 1974 to 1989, he expanded the bank\u2019s activities in Asia and navigated it through the cultural change brought about by the City\u2019s Big Bang in the 1980s. During this time, he served as Deputy Chair of <italic>Royal Insurance</italic>, Director at BOE, and sat on other boards. Removing Bob Horton in 1991, Baring became Chair of <italic>British Petroleum</italic> from 1992 to 1995.\nWhile <italic>Bevan</italic>-descendants chaired <italic>Barclay</italic> in London again after three generations, their Pease cousins\u2014Quakers who, like the Bevans, sold <italic>Pease</italic> to <italic>Barclay</italic> at the turn of the century\u2014married John Varley, who rose at the bank.<italic> </italic>Other banker families diversified, with each successive generation pursuing a more profitable avenue using family networks. Since <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Adam Marris joined <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s board in 1953, his children and in-laws of, who, held executive roles into the 21st century. \nBorn in in Astoria, Queens, in 1914, Italian-American Michael Esposito was the son of Hackensack food merchant became a director at <italic>Hackensack Trust Co</italic> from 1946 until 1968, when he left for Garden<italic> State </italic>NB until 1978. His son, Michael Jr, joined <italic>Chase</italic> NB in 1961, rising to the comptrollership in 1974, and CFO from 1987 until becoming Chief Corporate Compliance, Control, & Administration Officer in 1992. Over the following decades, Michael Jr\u2019s three sons, Jim, Michael, and John Esposito, achieved senior positions in investment banking, with Michael co-heading the Financial Institutions Group at <italic>Goldman</italic>, John heading North American FIG at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, and Jim leading the EMEA Financing Group at <italic>Goldman</italic>.\nMeanwhile, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York continued to guide Paris. In 1981, Felix Rohatyn gave his IT&T board seat to Michel Weill to accept a position with <italic>Schlumberger</italic>. <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris led French reconstruction after WWII. After internment in a concentration camp, French Catholic banking scion Jean Riboud moved to New York to open a securities firm. From 1951, he led his client, <italic>Schlumberger</italic> oil services, and grew socialist. Also advising Jean\u2019s brother Antoine in conglomerating BSN with <italic>Saint-Gobain</italic> unsuccessfully in 1968 and <italic>Gervais-Danone </italic>in 1973, Meyer remained friendly with <italic>Fiat</italic>\u2019s Gianni Agnelli. By 1975, Agnelli\u2019s daughter married the son of French Jewish banker Jean-Paul Elkann, who directed <italic>Givenchy</italic> from 1980 and then <italic>Dior</italic>.\nWhile Riboud and Claude Alphand\u00e9ry\u2014a Lazard and Weill cousin who led their <italic>Immobili\u00e8re-Constructions de Paris</italic> and <italic>Banque de la Construction et des Travaux</italic> <italic>Publics</italic>\u2014supported Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand since the 1970s, France elected him in 1981 as President to follow Val\u00e9ry Estaing. While the socialist nationalizations in 1936 and 1946 focused on public service sectors such as railways, armaments, gas, electricity, and coal, the Marxist nationalizations of 1982 targeted financial industrial HCs weakened by the <italic>Panic of 1979</italic>, to reorg them using public finances. \nThe most notable example was French GE, a decentralized HC with interests in telecoms, electronics, mechanics, construction, shipbuilding, and various services. After <italic>Empain</italic> sold most of her stake in <italic>Empain Schneider</italic> and split the firm in 1980, a deeper restructuring under Mitterrand\u2019s government, As France nationalized<italic> Rothschild</italic> Paris and <italic>Paribas</italic>, the Rothschilds bought <italic>Orl\u00e9ans</italic>, a discontinued railroad shell that remained exchange listed, as a HC for activities. However, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris escaped by lobbying for doubling the asset threshold to one-billion-<italic>franc</italic><italic>s</italic>. \nSoon after nationalization, <italic>Paribas</italic> Chair Pierre Moussa sold the bank\u2019s assets to a Swiss firm. After scandal forced his resignation, former Chair Jacques Fouchier replaced him and leveraged his Socialist Party contacts to propose Jean-Yves Haberer, Directeur du Tr\u00e9sor, as Chair. Continuing to finance loss making steel, <italic>Paribas</italic> retained management autonomy, and the State did not intervene in her strategy, hiring, or financial reporting. \n<italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Nord</italic>, chaired by David Dautresme\u2014whose father came from an old Norman family and mother a Jew, followed his uncle into politics before joining <italic>Lyonnais</italic>\u2014resisted pressure to separate from <italic>Paribas</italic> in the name of regionalism. While dividend payouts were reduced under State ownership to preserve retained earnings, <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2014despite holding only 48% compared with the State\u2019s 51%\u2014successfully pushed the State to inject new capital into <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Nord</italic> on two occasions.\nAfter the death of Pierre Besse, <italic>Paribas</italic> opposed government attempts to install a senior civil servant as head of <italic>Co</italic> <italic>Bancaire</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Parisienne</italic>, instead appointing Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9vy-Lang in 1982. While his father was a director and his mother descended from the Alhadeff banking family of Rhodes, L\u00e9vy-Lang was born in Alexandria and attended <italic>Ecole Polytechnique</italic> in Paris and earned a PhD from <italic>Stanford</italic> Business in 1965. Working as an atomic engineer and at <italic>Schlumberger</italic> in France from the 1960s, he married a Goudchaux descendant. By 1976, he became a director at <italic>Co</italic> <italic>Bancaire</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Parisienne</italic>.\n<italic>Mo\u00ebt Hennessy</italic>, formed via the merger of regional cartels <italic>Mo\u00ebt Chandon</italic> and <italic>Hennessy</italic>, in 1971. As Alain Chevalier left MOF to join <italic>Mo\u00ebt Hennessy</italic> in 1982, Jacques Chirac\u2019s friend Bruno Roger made partner at <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris and became Chevalier\u2019s banker. Having transformed his father\u2019s French construction business into real estate, Bernard Arnault moved to America after the socialist Francois Mitterrand became President of France in 1981. While Mitterrand failed to recruit Rohatyn through Riboud, but after the <italic>franc</italic> collapsed, he gradually replaced Marxists with socialists. Joining<italic> Schlumberger</italic>\u2019s board in 1981, Rohatyn helped conglomerate the oil industrial <italic>Schlumberger</italic>, buying <italic>Fairchild Camera & Equipment</italic>, which they sold to <italic>National</italic> <italic>Semiconductor</italic> after Jean Riboud died in 1985. \nWhile Jean Riboud\u2019s brother Antoine led BSN, board directors included <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Pierre Weill and <italic>Neuflize Schlumberger Mallet</italic>\u2019s Managing Partner J\u00e9r\u00f4me Schlumberger Seydoux. Having sold <italic>Neuflize</italic> <italic>Schlumberger</italic> <italic>Mallet </italic>to Dutch ABN and barred from <italic>Schlumberger</italic> as a family member, Seydoux bought <italic>Chargeurs R\u00e9unis Shipping</italic> from the Fabre family by 1980, including Antoine Riboud as a director, and expanded <italic>Chargeurs</italic> into global textiles and media.\nAlthough France had several PMs of high caste Jewish descent before the Cold War escalated\u2014including Alexandre Caen Millerand (1920 and President for 1920-4), L\u00e9on Blum (1936-8, 1946-7), Rene Mayer (1953), Pierre Mend\u00e9s-France (1954-5)\u2014Huguenot descendants remained prominent in French public and private spheres.  Aside from Simone Lazard, Jews intermarried with Christians less than Catholics and Huguenots did with one another. Along with rising atheism, marriages of the Wendels with the traditionally Catholic Seilli\u00e8re and traditionally Huguenot Thellusson breached religious barriers to kinterlink politics, industry, and finance.\nSince Maurice Murville was President Charles Gaulle\u2019s final PM, Michel Rocard (1988-91) and Lionel Jospin (1997-2002) followed, along with many supports, like Louis Mermaz (President of the French National Assembly from 1981-6). In the private sector, influential leaders encompassed the Peugeot family, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Seydoux (<italic>Chargeurs R\u00e9unis Shipping</italic>) and his brother Nicolas (<italic>Gaumont</italic>), Serge Tchuruk (<italic>Alcatel</italic>), J\u00e9r\u00f4me Monod (<italic>Lyonnaise des Eaux</italic>), Jean-Louis Dumas (<italic>Herm\u00e8s</italic>), Louis Schweitzer (<italic>Renault</italic> CEO from 1992), Christian Blanc (<italic>Air France</italic>), and Bernard Westercamp (<italic>Accor</italic>). <italic>Hottinguer</italic> was one of the few remaining banks. Likewise, these families held sway in Swiss corporations as the Koechlins at <italic>Cigby</italic>. From 1994, the Schlumbergers retained a cousin to manage their family office after he worked at <italic>Paribas</italic> and UBS.\nAs France allowed subsidiary dividends to pay HC debt, which she made interest tax-free, Jean-Marie Messier advised on privatization. Hoping for another Meyer, Weill made him partner. In New York, Arnault noticed that more Americans knew <italic>Dior</italic> than Mitterrand. So, when France privatized bankrupt textile and diaper business <italic>Boussac</italic> in 1984, he hired <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Bernheim to buy <italic>Boussac</italic>. Winning over the larger <italic>Bidermann</italic>, Arnault sold <italic>Boussac</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> assets until only <italic>Dior</italic> remained. To his annoyance, <italic>Louis Vuitton</italic>, the textiles retailer, acquired <italic>Parfums Dior</italic> with the help of <italic>Paribas</italic>. Arnault saw an opportunity as Chevalier and Racamier argued. As Roger tried to save Chevalier, Bernheim secretly helped Arnault takeover LVMH using a Luxembourg-domiciled shell company in 1990. \nThrough the decolonization era, locals replaced imperial colonists. While losing her monopoly in Kuwait and elsewhere, <italic>British Bank of the Middle East</italic> (\u201cBBME\u201d) was nationalized in Syria in 1961, Iraq in 1964, Aden in 1969, and Libya in 1970. As BBME\u2019s 30-year lease in Kuwait approached expiration in 1971, she shifted her regional focus to Bahrain. After BBME\u2019s Kuwaiti operations ended in 1971, <italic>Bank of Kuwait </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>the Middle East</italic><italic> </italic>replaced her.\nWhile gold trading activity in the Middle East became closely tied to the oil price, countries followed different path along the Persian Gulf. Before the 1950s, Saudi Arabia had no domestic banks, only branches of foreign banks offering Western-style services, including Dutch <italic>Saudi Hollandi</italic>, French <italic>Indochine</italic>, British BBME, <italic>Jordan Arab Bank</italic>, <italic>Bank of Lebanon & Overseas</italic>,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Pakistani</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>. The population relied on money-changing for financial needs due to religious concerns about interest-bearing transactions. \nThe discovery of oil and growing wealth led to a change. In 1952, the Kingdom adopted a more open banking policy and established <italic>Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency</italic> (\u201cSAMA\u201d). As <italic>Saudi</italic> <italic>National Commercial Bank</italic> and <italic>Riyad Bank</italic> domestic banks started, <italic>Chase</italic> developed a depository for SAMA, private banks, and royals, and <italic>Citi</italic> established a branch in 1955. A year after starting in 1957, <italic>Rajhi </italic>moneychangers began women-only branches.\nLike for centuries before, the Hadhrami dominated Arabian finance and commerce.  While the Ladens own the Kingdom\u2019s largest construction company, the Mahfouz held sway over <italic>Saudi National Commercial Bank</italic>, the Arab world\u2019s largest bank. As the Baeshen, Bassamah and Binzagr imported food, the Barooms traded building materials, and the Bugshans represented the Japanese bulldozer manufacturer <italic>Komatsu</italic>.\nFollowing the oil inflation of 1973, Saudi Arabia and other oil producers funded regional development banks and other institutions. With the start of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, Beirut\u2019s banks experienced a surge in deposits, particularly from PLO, which headquartered in the city. A second source was the sale of roughly 30,000 tons of hashish and other illegal drugs, generating annual revenues of up to $2 billion. Moreover, foreign governments, such as Iran, Israel, Iraq, and Libya, financially supported Lebanese militias, with reports indicating substantial monthly payments to militia leaders. However, the Near Eastern physical gold exchange refocused to Kuwait and UAE\u2019s Dubai due to stability and oil wealth. \nKuwait aimed to transform itself into a foreign investment hub in the late 1970s, diversifying its wealth from oil to financial holdings for the benefit of its population. It developed capital markets, including a stock exchange, investment firms, and brokers. To promote this agenda, the government supported land purchases and encouraged speculation in the stock markets. A parallel stock market emerged, attracting interest from ministers and members of the ruling family who engaged in speculative activities. By 1979, <italic>Central Bank of Kuwait</italic> imposed restrictions on Kuwaiti <italic>dinar</italic> deposits abroad, reducing the availability of funds. As Dubai attracted gold, <italic>Central Bank of UAE</italic> organized in 1980 for monetary control. \nIn Libya, Muammar Gaddafi enlisted Abdullah Saudi to diversify foreign investments. As Head of <italic>Libyan Arab Foreign Bank</italic>, Saudi managed foreign assets, engaging in loans, bonds, and equity investments, particularly in the finance, tourism, manufacturing, and real estate sectors. In 1976, Abdullah Saudi negotiated with <italic>MedicoBanca</italic>\u2019s Cuccia for Libya to buy 9% of Italy\u2019s largest manufacturer, <italic>Fiat</italic>. By 1980, Libya expanded her investments to Italy, included loans to the Italian national energy company. Additionally, Libya participated in consortium banks and held a minority stake in smaller banks primarily focused on trade financing.\nAmidst the oil boom, a Saudi law of 1980 required foreign banks, including <italic>Citi</italic>, sell a majority stake to Saudi nationals, prompting the bank\u2019s name change to <italic>Saudi American Bank.</italic> Local money-changing business also expanded. While Subeaei managed 15 branches, a cousin of <italic>National Commercial Bank</italic>, Mohamed Kaki ran 10. Money-changing families with fewer branches included <italic>Bagalaf</italic>, <italic>Abdul Aziz Mukairin</italic>, and <italic>Ahmed Abdul Qani Bamaodah</italic>. With 230 branches, <italic>Rajhi</italic> was Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest money-changing company. From the Bani Zeid in the Najd desert before the discovery of oil in Saudi Arabia, the Rajhi family moved to Riyadh in search of better opportunities in 1930. \nAfter selling kerosene and groceries, they entered the money-changing business. Focusing on pilgrims visiting Mecca and Medina, <italic>Rajhi</italic> bought gold from Jeddah pilgrims and sold it in Riyadh. Abdulah Rajhi The son of <italic>Rajhi</italic>\u2019s Chair, launched his own competing business out of Dammam, boasting 40 branches. While focusing on FX for foreign workers in Saudi Arabia, Abdulah Rajhi also speculated gold. His main creditor in this context was <italic>Kredietbank</italic>, Belgium\u2019s third-largest bank, with smaller creditors including <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic>, <italic>Thomas Cook</italic> of <italic>Midland Bank</italic>, and <italic>Westminster Bank</italic>.\nAs oil wealth drove spending, the profits of monopolistic Middle Eastern distributors rivaled those of the largest public companies in the West. While <italic>Alghanim</italic> of Kuwait emerged as <italic>General </italic><italic>Motor</italic>\u2019s largest overseas distributor with revenues of around $400 million in 1982, Sheik Omar Aggad of <italic>Juffali</italic> secured the <italic>Daimler Benz</italic> franchise for the Kingdom, selling over $600 million worth of trucks and represented IBM, <italic>Ericsson</italic>, <italic>Siemens</italic>, and <italic>Michelin</italic>. Amidst American panics, Prince Rhaled Saud partnered with Sunman Olayan to form <italic>Olayan</italic>. \nFrom the late 1970s, <italic>Olayan</italic> acquired stakes in banks\u2014about 1% of <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Mellon Bank</italic> of Pittsburgh, <italic>Southeast Bancorp</italic> of Miami, <italic>Valley National</italic> of Phoenix, <italic>First Bank</italic> of Minneapolis, <italic>National City Bank</italic> of Cleveland, and <italic>Western Bancorp</italic> and <italic>Hawaii Bancorp</italic> of Honolulu\u2014and <italic>Thermo Electron Corp </italic>and<italic> Whittaker</italic> industrials. After<italic> </italic>increasing ownership in <italic>First Chicago Corp</italic> to over 7% in 1980, <italic>Olayan</italic> bought 14% of <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic>, growing it to 24%. \nLikewise, <italic>Smith Barney</italic> sold a 25% stake to a Saudi-Kuwait-Bahrani consortium, including Aggad and Sagr. As several of Middle Easterners joined <italic>Smith Barney</italic>\u2019s board, they urged expansion and risk taking, and the bank entered the government-securities market for the first time. Hundreds of other Middle Eastern banks opened offices in America and Europe. While a brother-in-law of <italic>Dillon</italic>\u2019s John Birkelund represented <italic>Trans-</italic><italic>Arabian Investment Bank</italic> in New York, Saudi oil monopoly <italic>Petromin</italic>-affiliated<italic> Saudi European Bank</italic> operated in Paris and New York, handling letters of credit for oil.\nMeanwhile, liberal licenses attracted a flurry of banks of Bahrain. While mostly large Western multinational banks, but also Japanese, and <italic>Banco de Brasil</italic> by 1979. Specialized institutions, such as <italic>Arab Malaysian Development Bank</italic>. By 1981, Bahrain\u2019s aluminum smelter faced losses while her offshore banking sector continued growing. In 1982, Libya, Kuwait, and UAE\u2019s Abu Dhabi co-founded <italic>Arab Banking Corp</italic>. Headed by Abdullah Saudi and the largest Arab bank, <italic>Arab Banking Corp</italic>\u2019s continued growing, and bought a German bank. As Saudi Arabian commercial banks faced competition, SAMA threatened to tax Bahrain.\nIn 1982, Nemir Kirdar founded <italic>Investcorp</italic> in Bahrain with investors including Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Yamani. Born in Iraq, Kirdar\u2019s great-grandfather served as mayor of Kirkuk under the Ottomans, his grandfather sat in the Ottoman parliament. In 1921 King Faisal I invited Kirdar\u2019s grandfather to return from Istanbul to help form the new Iraqi government. Kirdar\u2019s father and brother later entered the Iraqi parliament. After the coup of 1958, he left Iraq for America. \nAlong with attending university, he became a teller at <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Arizona</italic>. In the early 1960s he returned to Iraq, founded <italic>Kirdar</italic>, but was arrested and detained without charge before leaving again as the Baath Party consolidated power. In the early 1970s he worked in Asia for <italic>Allied Bank</italic> until he joined <italic>Chase Manhattan</italic> in 1974 as a lending officer, and by the late 1970s became head of Gulf operations. From 1984, <italic>Investcorp</italic> acquired <italic>Tiffany</italic> and later <italic>Gucci</italic>.\nConcerns escalated in the region due to the <italic>Iran-Iraq War</italic>. By 1981, Iran delegalized gold ownership and ordered all gold confiscated. Fall in oil prices leads to a decline in gold trading in the Middle East. As the price of gold declined from $800 an ounce to $350 in 1981, the banks asked Abdullah Rajhi to cover his paper losses. However, due to his speculative dealings, Rajhi, had become estranged from his family, resulting in their refusal to assist him. Despite SAMA\u2019s limited jurisdiction over money changers at the time, SAMA facilitated a liquidation of assets and repayment to small creditors in 1985, but major lenders were still awaiting settlement. This case highlighted the need for stricter regulation of money changers, implemented in late 1981. This incident led to international repercussions, with British and Belgian banks owed millions of dollars.\nAs Israeli invaded Lebanon in 1982, CIA called on banker Roger Tamraz, a confidant of President Amin Gemayel with connections to Lebanese Christian militias allied with Israel, to hasten an Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon. By 1983, Tamraz secured a position on <italic>Intra</italic>\u2019s board of directors, appointed by Lebanese President Gemayel. Tamraz rapidly expanded, amassing large interests in <italic>Middle East Airlines</italic>, <italic>Beirut Harbour</italic>, and <italic>Machrek Bank</italic>,<italic> First Phoenician Bank</italic>, <italic>Capital Trust</italic>, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Libanais</italic>, <italic>Real Estate Co of Lebanon</italic>, <italic>Franco-Lebanese Real Estate</italic> <italic>Co</italic>, <italic>Baalbeck Studios</italic>, <italic>Whole Mountain Co</italic>, <italic>Trans-Orient Co</italic>, <italic>Intra</italic> <italic>Insurance</italic>, <italic>Bank of Kuwait</italic>, and <italic>Arab World & Saint-Louis Real Estate</italic>. Tamraz\u2019s <italic>Tamoil</italic> also merged with Libya\u2019s <italic>National Oil Co</italic>. \nWith government officials and the ruling family actively participation and land purchases, Kuwait\u2019s stock market, <italic>Souk Manakh</italic> boomed. As oil prices fell, the <italic>Souk Manakh</italic> bubble burst in August 1982. The stock market problems were worsened by a real estate crisis resulting from the government\u2019s inability to acquire land, negatively impacting land values. As banks faced bad debts, the economy entered a state of stagnation. \nThe Kuwaiti government responded by canceling the real estate market, providing cash payments, issuing dinar debt, and establishing <italic>Kuwait Clearing </italic>to address bounced checks. Banks implemented rules to account for bad debts as loans secured by real estate and Persian Gulf shares became worthless assets. This crisis caused significant damage to Kuwait\u2019s financial sector, leading to a surge in non-performing loans. The <italic>Central Bank of Kuwait</italic> stabilized the sector by making provisions for bad debts and implementing stricter controls.\nWhen the real estate market crashed spread to UAE and defaults grew, <italic>Central Bank of UAE</italic> consolidated the commercial bank sector by requiring banks to increase their paid-up capital by the end of 1982. By 1983, to reduce reliance on foreign banks, SAMA restricted the participation of non-Saudi banks in Saudi <italic>riyal</italic> syndicated transactions and mandated prior approval for leading <italic>dollar</italic> syndications. \nThese sudden regulatory changes caused panic in the Bahraini market, as many Saudi and foreign corporations heavily relied on syndicated loans in Saudi <italic>riyals</italic>. Saudi Arabia also introduced a 7% tax on gold jewelry imports, affecting Kuwait and Bahrain. Descended from the founding rulers of Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, Saudi Prince Walid Solh Saud founded <italic>Kingdom Holding Co</italic>, traded on the <italic>Saudi Stock Exchange</italic>. While his initial business venture faced bankruptcy, but he rebounded by focusing on real estate and construction, establishing <italic>Kingdom Establishment for Commerce & Trade</italic>. \nAs with oil, gold changes pursued. In Ghana, following years of economic instability and a string of military and civilian regimes, Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawlings launched a coup as the head of Ghana\u2019s <italic>Provisional National Defense Council</italic> (\u201cPNDC\u201d) in 1981 and abolished political parties. PNDC focused on stabilizing and improving government finances, switching from currency inflation to tax collection. \nTo combat trading malpractices and foreign influence, PNDC monopolized import-export trade and created \u2018Peoples Shops\u2019 to regulate the distribution of essential goods within the country. Raised their ownership in the local <italic>Barclay </italic>and <italic>Standard</italic> branches, PNDC restricted foreign-controlled banks to specialized banking activities. Negotiating with IMF from 1982, PNDC\u2019s recovery plan included cocoa, timber, and mining rehabilitation. With funds from IFC, PNDC<italic> </italic>reorganized <italic>Ashanti Goldfields</italic>, which multiplied exports.\nSince 1982, Viktor Gerashchenko returned from <italic>Narodny</italic> Singapore to Moscow as Deputy Chair of the board of <italic>Vneshtorg</italic>.  While <italic>Narodny</italic> Zurich maintained market presence with constant gold sales for <italic>dollars</italic>, Marxist control required immediate accounting. So, as the <italic>dollar</italic> collapsed in 1984, the bank realized large losses. To help the Swiss avoid scandal and compete with Britain in the gold trade, BSU dissolved <italic>Narodny</italic> Zurich and Gerashchenko started <italic>Vneshtorg </italic>Zurich. \nMeanwhile, in London, BOE suspected JMB loan quality in 1983, an audit discovered fraudulent loans to Nigerian businessmen in late 1984. As <italic>Crocker </italic>NB teetered, BOE bought JMB for a \u00a31 and forced <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> to invest \u00a350 million into JMB. Soon after, BOE Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton\u2019s fourth cousin Michael Wyndham, a great nephew of Hannah Rothschild and fourth great-grandson of the original Abel Smyth, married <italic>Johnson</italic> heiress Alison Matthey Geddes. \nThat year, two years after resigning from <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>, Harry Oppenheimer relinquished the chairmanship of <italic>DeBeers</italic> to <italic>Lazard</italic> London-in-law Julian Thompson. <italic>Midland</italic> <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> bought the rest of the shaken <italic>Crocker</italic>, which re-hired one of America\u2019s few senior Jewish commercial banker, <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> Vice Chair Richard Rosenberg as Vice Chair. \nMoreover, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Macquarie</italic>, <italic>Westpac</italic>, and began lending on gold in Australia, and <italic>Westpac</italic> bought <italic>Johnson</italic> in <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s gold fixing cartel. Underinvestment since the 1960s depressed output at Ghana\u2019s nationalized <italic>Ashanti Goldfields</italic> by the early 1980s. However, a shift in Ghana\u2019s policies in 1983 towards a more free-market approach, supported by IMF and <italic>BANK</italic>, revitalized <italic>Ashanti</italic>. As a new law allowed Ashanti to keep 45% of its export in 1985, IMF granted <italic>Ashanti</italic> a loan ahead of the resurgence of Ghana\u2019s gold mining industry.\nCanada followed Britain several months later, allowing her five national banks to engage with securities. But it was <italic>Canada</italic> <italic>Power</italic> IHC, stripped of PUs since 1963, that became the dominant securities financier with operating assets including <italic>London </italic>and<italic> Canada </italic>LICs, after Andre Desmarais bought control from the old Nesbitt interests in 1968 with<italic> </italic>investment from <italic>Lambert</italic>, followed by media purchases and politically savvy recruiting. By 1970, <italic>Paribas</italic> joined the alliance.\nAs Japan and other energy importers thrived, Texan oil firms consolidated with stock swaps and real estate construction slowed. Still depositors did not run from Texan banks. Although FDR died before American victory in WWII, his supporters blamed cartels for fascism and pushed laws to limit power on occupied Germany and Japan. While private Japanese PUHCs cartelized in 1951, antitrust regulators did not file any criminal charges until inflation of 1972. As Japan\u2019s <italic>Fuji Bank</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic> sponsored 110 global private banks to form <italic>Private Investment Co for Asia</italic>,<italic> </italic>to<italic> </italic>develop Asia and West Pacific in 1969 using the <italic>ADELA</italic> model with former <italic>Lazard</italic> partner Stanley Osborne as Chair and <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s George Moore as a director, Japan\u2019s <italic>Finance</italic> <italic>Ministry </italic>blurred FA1933-like separation, letting bank and securities firm consortia float two trade banks in London for MMEU in 1970. \nBy the 1980s Japan reflected the pre-1930s as zaibatsu and her coal, ore, and grain import and distribution monopolies competed fiercely. The <italic>Diet</italic>\u2019s bank loss reserve tax incentivized BHCs for managerial change or loan restructuring. Without cramdowns or lender liability, there was no need for LBOs. The <italic>Diet</italic> also monetized land by taxing sales more than property, permitting tax-free plot exchanges, and securing revolving loans. As interest and real estate depreciation were tax-deductible, heirs of appreciated land and other landowners borrowed to finance construction. \nLike leases grew the West, they followed only PUs in Japan\u2019s capital investment spending. Similarly, corporations borrowed to purchase land and American LBOs.  By decreasing banking credit costs, rising land increased lending. As oil and gas deflated, FRS allowed interest rates to fall in 1986. With capital costs at their lowest level since 1977, tax-exempt investors\u2014particularly pensions and Japanese banks\u2014invested in KKR\u2019s LBOs. \nIn the struggle against organized crime, Congress enacted the <italic>Racketeer Influenced & Corrupt Orgs Act</italic> (\u201cRICO\u201d) in 1970 and deregulated trucking in 1980. DOJ did not use RICO until Reagan named Rudolph Giuliani federal prosecutor. Giuliani paired RICO with media soundbites for public opinion. In 1985, DOJ accused <italic>First NB of Boston</italic> failing to report large currency shipments to and from Swiss banks and processing unreported cash transactions from 1980 and on behalf of New England-crime boss Gennaro Angiulo, who exchanged cash for cashier\u2019s checks at the bank without proper reporting. Imprisoned and threatening to talk about the Costa Nostra\u2019s Long Island connections, Italian banker Michele Sindona received a coffee laced with cyanide in his cell in 1986. By 1988, DOJ applied RICO to unions.\n<italic>Insider trading</italic> (\u201cIT\u201d) grew with LBOs. Unlike earlier management IT,<italic> </italic>now perpetrators were outsiders. As IT slowed deals, SEC required outsider disclosure until the Court stopped it in 1980. Although IT presented no harm to either sellers or bidders, SEC upheld the public interest principle that investor trust would keep the 1930s from reoccurring. While a viable theory of harm would not be invented for several years, IT remained legal for policy makers, including members of Congress and FRS. \nSo, SEC regulated general tender disclosures and lobbied Congress for harsher penalties. As LBOs grew, IT scandals forced Reagan Administration officials to resign. Congress ordered DOJ enforce IT in 1984, bit without a definition, court judgments politicized. By the time Rohatyn advised Ross Perot on the sale of EDS to <italic>General </italic><italic>Motor</italic>, a former <italic>Lazard</italic> New York banker and an intern traded IT with Boesky. While <italic>General </italic><italic>Motor</italic> hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> to reorg her structure from 5 to 2 divisions, savings were nil.\nSince 1982, <italic>McKinsey</italic> advocated core specialty over conglomerates. Although LBOs used an array of debt to takeover conglomerates, DBL and her HYB rainmaker, Michael Milken, became poster children for \u2018junk\u2019 leveraged raiding. Unlike slow bond sales and bank loans, DBL\u2019s fast <italic>highly confident letter </italic>concept reduced the chances of information leakage and allowed for larger LBOs. With Reagan\u2019s antitrust reforms, LBOs de-conglomerated industry, replacing NOCs with revenues. As the chemicals industry faced foreign competition, firms engaged in both operational and financial restructuring. \nAfter marrying John Morgan\u2019s second great niece and heading <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Continental European practice in Paris in the late 1960s, John Macomber became Head of <italic>Celanese</italic>. (He was not closely related to Boston banker John Macomber.) Closing plants, he focused <italic>Celanese</italic> on fiber and core chemicals. The Swiss Dreyfus brothers began chemical experiments in Basel in 1904, shifted to cellulose acetate products, and founded <italic>Celanese</italic> in New York in 1918. \nWhile Vernon Jordan joined <italic>Celanese</italic>\u2019s board shortly after he became Executive Director of <italic>Urban League </italic>in 1971, both Macomber and Vernon joined RJR\u2019s board by 1982. Having started as a tobacco company, RJR conglomerated in the 1970s to become a large oil producers and operator of <italic>Kentucky Fried Chicken</italic>, <italic>Del Monte</italic>, and other businesses. Although <italic>Celanese</italic> sold cigarette filters to RJR, she was only a secondary supplier.\nSince buying <italic>Cushman Wakefield</italic> in 1976 and <italic>Westley Energy</italic> in 1980, <italic>Rockefeller </italic>partnered with RCA on cable-network <italic>Entertainment </italic>channel in 1981, they soon lost $40 million. By 1982, Head of <italic>Chase</italic> NB David Rockefeller retired to become Chair of <italic>Rockefeller</italic> with a goal of spreading its investments to the 90 or 5th-generation descendants of John Rockefeller. \nSelling <italic>Wessely </italic>to <italic>TransCanada</italic> and raising equity from <italic>Mitsubishi</italic> for <italic>Cushman Wakefield </italic>by 1984, Rockefeller bought <italic>Outlet Communications</italic> and rebranded her as <italic>ROCK</italic>. As links with <italic>Columbia </italic>encumbered <italic>Rockefeller Center</italic>, <italic>Rockefeller</italic> mortgaged <italic>Rockefeller Center</italic> to buy out <italic>Columbia </italic>by establishing <italic>Rockefeller Center </italic>REIT with Rockefeller as Chair and <italic>Blackstone</italic>\u2019s Pete Peterson on the board, which <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Shearson Lehman</italic><italic> Kuhn</italic> facilitated in going public in 1985. By 1986, <italic>Rockefeller</italic> offloaded <italic>Outlet Communications</italic> in a MBO at a large profit.\nIn 1981, Britain established <italic>British Telecom</italic> (\u201cBT\u201d) as a separate, state-owned entity and allowed competitors in the domestic telephone network. <italic>Mercury Communications</italic>, founded in 1981, became a significant long-distance communications competitor on a digital network. By 1984, Britain privatized BT via <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic> and established regulatory oversight. To promote competition in telephony and cable (keeping the telephone and cable cross-ownership ban), Congress revoked AT&T\u2019s telecom monopoly in 1984 and broke up AT&T into seven \u2018Baby Bells.\u2019 \nMilken\u2019s HYB helped these risky ventures\u2014including <italic>Fairfield Cable</italic>\u2014to consolidate and build internet infrastructure. In 1985, <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>MINERAL</italic>\u2019s<italic> Salomon</italic>, and <italic>Wachtell</italic> advised <italic>Beatrice</italic> on KKR\u2019s record LBO backed by bank loans and DBL\u2019s <italic>highly confident letter</italic>, which KKR followed with eight big spin-offs. DBL and Milken funded TLC with HYB to buy one of KKRs spinoffs of <italic>Beatrice International</italic> in 1987, making TLC the first major Black LBO and biggest Black-owned business. \nIn 1984, industry analysts suggested that <italic>Revlon</italic> should be broken up and sold for a higher value. Just a year later, Ronald Perelman\u2019s <italic>MacAndrews Forbes</italic> launched a takeover bid for <italic>Revlon </italic>with DBL. Responding to this, <italic>Revlon </italic>sought to take the cosmetics division private with New York investment company<italic> Adler Shaykin</italic> and sell the rest to <italic>Forstmann Little</italic>. However, a Delaware judge vetoed the sale as detrimental to <italic>Revlon</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> shareholders. So, <italic>MacAndrews Forbes</italic> bought <italic>Revlon</italic> by late 1985. Perelman also worked closely <italic>Akin Gump</italic>\u2019s Vernon Jordan, who joined his boards. Following the purchase, Perelman divested <italic>Revlon</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s healthcare businesses, while acquiring fragrances, and focusing the conglomerate on beauty.\nVernon Jordan also resumed building his legacy after the death of his wife. In 1986, he married Ann, the daughter of <italic>Howard</italic> Medical graduate Eugene Dibble Jr. Unlike most American Blacks before the <italic>Immigration Act of 1965</italic>, the Dibbles migrated to South Carolina as merchants of royal lineage and grew into the South\u2019s largest grocer. By 1888, Eugene Dibble Sr married his Vaughan cousin, who maintained the trans-Atlantic trade with cousins that returned to Nigeria, where a Michael Vaughan of Lagos began banking in 1920. \nStarting his career in 1920 at <italic>Tuskegee Institut</italic><italic>e</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s<italic> John Memorial Hospital</italic>, Dibble Jr served as an assistant. After joining <italic>Virginia Hospital</italic>, he returned to lead <italic>John Memorial Hospital</italic> as medical director, and then <italic>Virginia Hospital</italic>. In 1926, he married the daughter of MIT\u2019s first Black graduate, Robert Taylor, who was born a slave in North Carolina and went on to manage the Rosenwald and other real estate in Tuskegee. \nAs Michael Vaughan of the Nigerian branch of the trans-Atlantic trade Vaughn cousins continued banking in Lagos, his cousins included Nigeria\u2019s Chief Justice. In America, Eugene Dibble III graduated <italic>Tuskegee</italic> in 1952, he served as a munitions and demolition officer in the Air Force and became a NYSE broker with <italic>Strauss Blosser MacDowell</italic> in 1955 until co-founding <italic>Astro Investment Co</italic> in 1965 to promote Black American economic influence. Dibble ventured into politics, serving as the Republican candidate for Water Commissioner for the City of Chicago in 1966. By the time she married Vernon, Ann Dibble was on <italic>Johnson & Johnson</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> board. The family served on seventeen boards within a decade.\n<italic>Lazard</italic> London also became a takeover target. Along with their ownership in <italic>Lazard</italic> London, <italic>Pearson</italic> owned regional and financial newspapers. In 1984, media mogul Rupert Murdoch\u2014allied with <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> Chair Catto\u2014bought shares in <italic>Pearson</italic>. To resist his advances, Weill proposed to <italic>Pearson</italic> that he would buy a large stake in the company and receive enough of <italic>Pearson</italic>\u2019s shares in <italic>Lazard</italic> London to ensure independence for both. <italic>Pearson</italic> shareholders approved the <italic>Cazenove</italic> valued proposal, and Weill took control of all three houses for the first time in <italic>Lazard</italic> Partners. \nWith the encouragement of Nigel Fraser, Weill replaced Fraser with John Nott, the former defense secretary under Thatcher, as the new leader of <italic>Lazard</italic> London. The HC overseeing <italic>Lazard</italic> Partners also made other investments. <italic>Gaz & Eaux</italic> began in 1881 to distribute water and gas to north and western France. As France nationalized gas distribution in 1945, <italic>Gaz </italic>lost her gas concession. <italic>Gaz </italic>continued her water business until 1976, when she was privatized and taken over by <italic>Paribas</italic> and other banks and insurers. Amidst a takeover attempt in 1985, <italic>Gaz </italic>approached <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, and <italic>Lazard</italic> Partners invested in <italic>Gaz</italic>. <italic>Gaz</italic> then held <italic>Pearson</italic>. \nAs <italic>Britoil</italic> sold at a loss, Thatcher hired <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Fraser to privatize <italic>Britoil</italic>\u2019s North Sea oil in 1985. Since other OPEC members continued producing above quotas, Saudi Arabia stopped supporting the price, and oil deflated further. Only American and Japanese tariff threats eventually restarted production controls. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1986</italic>, Saudi Prince Walid Solh Saud took over the struggling <italic>United Saudi Commercial</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>. Since construction and engineering firm <italic>Bechtel </italic>bought <italic>Dillon</italic> in 1981, losses led her to sell <italic>Dillon</italic> to <italic>Travelers </italic>business insurer by July 1986. Also in 1986, as <italic>Fiat</italic>\u2019s merger with <italic>Ford Motor</italic> fell apart, and <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> bought Libya\u2019s <italic>Fiat</italic> stake, becoming the second largest shareholder. <italic>Fiat</italic> soon bought <italic>Alfa Romeo</italic> and <italic>Maserati</italic>. \nAfter a major loss in 1986, Larry Fink resigned as CSFB\u2019s Head of Fixed Income, and co-founded <italic>BlackRock</italic> as part of <italic>Blackstone</italic> in 1988. Fink\u2019s brother, Steven, was a lawyer and Michael Milken\u2019s neighbor from 1984. Refocusing on restructuring, Steven transformed <italic>Anthony Manufacturing</italic> from a freezer door company into an energy management business, leading to its sale in 1986. In 1987, he joined forces with Milken, working through <italic>Pacific Asset Holdings</italic> to restructure <italic>Republic Health</italic>, which was later sold to <italic>Tenet Healthcare</italic>. Fink also helped manage George Gillette\u2019s control of Vail and Beaver Creek resorts while working at <italic>International Capital Access Group</italic>.\nBy 1986, British deregulation ended stock exchange restrictive practices. With the \u2018<italic>Big Bang</italic>\u2019, Parliament created <italic>financial</italic> HCs (\u201cFHCs\u201d). FHCs allowed for bank financial conglomerates to provide a wider range of services. British merchant banks lost their \u2018accepting\u2019 privilege, the right to have their bills bought by BOE at the finest possible rate, and protection from failure. \nSo, merchant banks expanded their networks of brokers and jobbers between 1983 and 1985. <italic>Warburg</italic> bought jobber <italic>Akroyd Smithers</italic> and brokers <italic>Rowe Pittman</italic> and <italic>Mullens</italic>. <italic>Baring</italic> secured broker <italic>Henderson Crosthwaite</italic> and jobber <italic>Wilson Watford</italic>. <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and <italic>Guinness Mahon</italic> brought in jobbers <italic>Smith</italic> and <italic>White Cheesman</italic>. <italic>Hambro</italic>, <italic>Midland</italic> <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic>, and <italic>Hill Samuel</italic> included brokers <italic>Greenwell</italic>, <italic>Strauss Turnbull</italic>, and <italic>Wood Mackenzie</italic> in their operations. \nBuying<italic> </italic>broker <italic>Pember Boyle</italic> and jobber <italic>Pinchin Denny</italic>, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> listed on <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> in 1986\u2014where her New York based investment subsidiary was NYSE-listed\u2014becoming the dominant deal advisory, including for clients such as brewer  <italic>Guinness</italic><italic> </italic>from <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. Along with acquiring <italic>Visa</italic>\u2019s traveler\u2019s check operation to become the third-largest issuer in the world in 1986, <italic>Barclay</italic> purchased Smyth-cousins <italic>Zoete Bevan</italic>, and Timothy Bevan chaired <italic>Barclay</italic>. Likewise, depositor-owned <italic>Trustee Savings Bank</italic> (\u201cTSB\u201d) floated her shares and acquired <italic>Hill Samuel</italic> and other financials.  \nSmyth-in-law Nicholas Goodison became her Chair after selling <italic>Quilter Goodison</italic> to <italic>Commercial Union</italic> and retiring as Chair of <italic>London </italic><italic>S</italic><italic>tock </italic><italic>E</italic><italic>xchange</italic>, where he was replaced by <italic>Smyth</italic> cousin Andrew Smyth. Transitioning from a partnership to a publicly listed company, <italic>Rathbone</italic> merged with <italic>Comprehensive Financial Services</italic>, a profitable firm founded with early backing from <italic>Inchcape</italic> and <italic>Pearson</italic>.\nThe same year, BOE began supervising the London gold bullion market. So, <italic>Midland</italic> <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> sold <italic>Crocker</italic>. As part of the approval process for <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> to buy <italic>Crocker</italic>, FRS ordered the sale of seven North California branches. Hong Kong-based <italic>First Pacific</italic>\u2019s <italic>Hibernia</italic> bought the branches.\nDeregulation also spurred London\u2019s largest investment banks, <italic>Warburg</italic> and <italic>Kleinwor</italic><italic>t</italic><italic> Benson</italic>, to expand internationally. As <italic>Warburg</italic> gained a seat on <italic>Tokyo Stock Exchange</italic>, <italic>Kleinwor</italic><italic>t</italic><italic> Benson</italic> built on her American acquisitions from 1984\u2014including a California swaps group, a Chicago futures broker, and UST bond dealer\u2014with an American LIC<italic> </italic>from<italic> TransAmerica</italic> and London stockbroker <italic>Grieveson Grant</italic>. While hiring the former President of <italic>White Weld</italic>\u2014who had become a <italic>Merrill Lynch</italic> Senior Vice President\u2014to expand in America, <italic>Kleinwort</italic><italic> </italic>rejected acquisition of <italic>Dillon</italic> over cost and control concerns. \n<italic>Phoenix</italic> advised on around two-thirds of these mergers, founded by John Craven in 1981. Craven was born in Massachusetts and began his career as an accountant with <italic>Wood Gundy</italic> in Canada. In 1967 he joined <italic>Warburg</italic> London, becoming a director in 1969. He left in 1973 for <italic>Credit Suisse White Weld</italic>, working under Stanislas Yassukovich, succeeded him as CEO, and left after opposing the merger that created <italic>Credit Suisse First Boston</italic> in 1978. After stints with <italic>Warburg</italic> and <italic>Merrill Lynch</italic>, he founded <italic>Phoenix</italic>.\nMeanwhile, the Guinness family no longer led the family brewer and kinterlinked with the Jewish Samuel of <italic>Hill Samuel</italic> in 1980. That following year, <italic>Guinness </italic>hired consultancy <italic>Bain </italic>to grow via acquisition to avoid becoming a takeover target. In 1982, <italic>Bain</italic>\u2019s Olivier Roux joined <italic>Guinness</italic> as a consultant and became Director of Financial Strategy in 1984, advising Ernest Saunders. Saunders became CEO, sold 160 companies, focused on retail and brewing, and acquired specialty foods, publishing, and <italic>7-Eleven</italic> stores. By mid-1985, profits and share price increased. Saunders led the takeover of <italic>Distillers Co</italic> and coordinated with Ivan Boesky and <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic>. \n<italic>Guinness</italic> auditors discovered invoices for services from investors. An investigation by the British Department of Trade & Industry led Saunders to resign. Roux resigned in 1987. While Roux resigned, <italic>Bain</italic>\u2019s tarnished reputation led her to reduce 10% of her workforce. As <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> resigned as <italic>Guinness</italic>\u2019 merchant banker, BOE pressured <italic>Morgan Grenfell </italic>Chair<italic> </italic>Stephen Catto to remove Chris Reeves. Following the scandal, <italic>Phoenix</italic>\u2019s John Craven became CEO of <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> in 1987, arranging the acquisition of <italic>Phoenix</italic> as part of the move. In 1988 he shuttered the lossmaking <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> Securities. As BOE restricted Reeves from executive roles, <italic>Merrill Lynch</italic>\u2019s Michael Clemm recruited him as Senior Adviser in 1988.\nIn America, meanwhile, managements lobbied Congress to revive TA1969 hybrid debt limits and remove HYB tax shields from hostile LBOs. As Congress debated, courts allowed management to employ poison pills against raiders in 1985, and firms lobbied states to codify management rights to shield themselves with this device. Indian companies had already employed such techniques in 1929.\n By 1985, as India\u2019s <italic>State Bank of India</italic> grew merchant banking services, <italic>Lazard</italic> expanded into India. After holding key positions in Asia-Pacific with <italic>Grindlay</italic> and <italic>Deutsche</italic>, Udayan Bose became Chair of a new a joint-venture with <italic>Lazard</italic> London by 1985, forming create India\u2019s first multinational investment bank, <italic>Credit Capital </italic>(\u201c<italic>Lazard</italic> India\u201d). While Bose chaired <italic>Kolkata Stock Exchange</italic> to modernize and attract foreign investors, he also made deals, advising on Marwari R.P. Goenka\u2019s acquisition of HMV.\nWhile <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic> Chair Pete Peterson named Lewis Glucksman co-CEO in 1983, they had different goals in mind, with Peterson wanting to sell the firm and Glucksman to grow it. As Glucksman sought to oust Peterson, most of the board supported him, but Peterson allies like Stephen Schwarzman and the sole outside director, Enrico Braggiotti of <italic>Banca Commercial Italiana</italic>. As Peterson left without a fight, Glucksman became more tyrannical and mortally wounded <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic>. After buying <italic>Safra</italic>\u2019s <italic>Trade Development Bank of Switzerland</italic> in 1983, <italic>American Express Shearson</italic> <italic>Loeb</italic> acquired <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic> in 1984 and forced Glucksman out. \nOnly briefly considering joining <italic>Lazard</italic>, Peter Peterson and Stephen Schwarzman took their winnings to start <italic>Blackstone</italic> to focus on LBOs Like Peterson derived from the Greek word for <italic>stone</italic>, Schwarzman\u2019s surname came from the German word for <italic>black.</italic> While at <italic>Harvard</italic> Business graduate, Schwarzman met and married the daughter of an Ohio industrialist by 1971. Following graduation, Schwarzman joined <italic>Lehman</italic>, where he excelled in M&A, notably handling a significant $488 million deal for <italic>Tropicana</italic> merging with <italic>Beatrice</italic> in 1978, soon making partner at <italic>Lehman</italic>. <italic>Lazard</italic> also experienced competition of lower leagues. <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic> also accelerated with HYB and bridge loan funded LBOs advising and co-investment under Hamilton James in competition with DBL.\nSimilarly, <italic>American Express</italic>\u2014along with <italic>Visa</italic> and <italic>MasterCard</italic>\u2014faced competition from <italic>Sears Dean Witter</italic> Purcell\u2019s new <italic>Discover</italic> card. As Sanford Weill saw few career prospects under Robinson, he left <italic>American Express</italic>, and he soon bought Baltimore-based financial services company <italic>Commercial Credit</italic>, which he grew into <italic>Smith Barney</italic> with his new assistant, Jamie Dimon, a third generation <italic>Shearson</italic> banker and son of an SVP. By 1983, the Greek Orthodox Dimon married a Jew from Maryland. \nSucceeding Weill as President of <italic>American Expres</italic>s in 1985, Louis Gerstner was born Catholic in Mineola, New York. After earned a <italic>Dartmouth</italic> engineering degree and <italic>Harvard</italic> MBA, he joined <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 1965. By 1977, Gerstner became Head of the Finance Practice and a Senior Partner on McKinsey\u2019s Executive Committee. That year, he resigned to lead <italic>American Express</italic>\u2019<italic> Travel Related Services Group</italic>, increasing the number of cards issued from 8 to nearly 31 million by 1988. By then, Gerstner led a team that included over 15 <italic>McKinsey</italic> alumni. According to a former partner, \u2018<italic>American Express was a McKinsey subsidiary in a lot of ways</italic>.\u2019\nSince 1981, GE closed 73 facilities, reduced jobs by 132 thousand, acquired 338 businesses for $11.1 billion, and gained $5.9 B from selling 232 businesses. By 1985, the company\u2019s low cash stash allowed for substantial borrowing. So GE acquired <italic>Kidder</italic> and RCA. Until <italic>Kreuger</italic> failed in the 1930s, <italic>Kidder</italic> had split the Boston Brahmin market with <italic>Higginson</italic>. After PA1935, <italic>Kidder </italic>focused on banking PUs. Once relying on <italic>Morgan</italic>, GE led leases in the 1880s. As  eliminated credits, GE bought <italic>Kidder</italic> and hired several high-ranking <italic>McKinsey</italic> partners. Meanwhile, the RCA conglomerate had been a takeover target since 1982 as breakup value grew. While Donald Trump and Boone Pickens bought shares, KKR pitched an MBO. As RCA explored selling off NBC, Rohatyn represented GE in buying RCA in 1986.\nSince BHCA1956 forced <italic>Bank of America</italic> to spin-off <italic>FirstAmerica</italic>, the latter retained <italic>McKinsey</italic> and attempted a hostile takeover of the former in 1986 but failed. As <italic>Bank of America</italic> restructured bad loans, CEO Tom Clausen hired Richard Rosenberg to restore profitability of subsidiary <italic>Seattle First</italic> NB as President and COO from <italic>Crocker</italic> after <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> took it over. Within months, Rosenberg ran <italic>Bank of America</italic>\u2019s California operations, making the bank profitable by expanding into credit cards and other business lines.\nBut with securities firms spurring commercial banks to risk, FRS deemed CP a demand deposit (like in Japan), subject to her rule and allowable for banks per FA1933 in 1984. The Court supported FRS, but the district court overturned her in 1986. As risk grew outside of FRS\u2019 regulated bank cartel, FRS required DBL to finance <italic>highly confident letters </italic>with bank loans. \nConcerned that many acquisitions served tax rather than business purposes, Congress overhauled taxes with TA1986. TA1986 increased the corporate tax over the personal rate\u2014the first time since TA1916\u2014and eliminated NOC trafficking and GUD. With advanced law notice, taxpayers shifted NOCs as corporates merged or disincorporated. To realize tax benefits, Canadian real estate entrepreneur Robert Campeau launched a hostile takeover of <italic>Allied Stores</italic>, an American retail HC owning <italic>Ann Taylor</italic>, <italic>Brooks Brothers</italic>, and <italic>Jordan Marsh</italic>. Campeau secured funds from CSFB\u2019s Bruce Wasserstein and a <italic>Citi</italic>-led bank syndicate. To finance the bridge loan, Campeau issued HYB, which paid off by selling most of <italic>Allied</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> assets.\nSince inflation moderated, TA1986 reduced TA1981\u2019s accelerated depreciation and eliminated the investment tax credits originated by TA1954 to reduce lease profits. PUs borrowed from GE, DBL, KKR, and IBM using sale-leasebacks. TA1986 also prohibited income tax write-offs of passive losses, installment tax benefits, and unwound capital gains preferences. As investors ran from loss-making tax shelters, real estate partnerships monetized by TA1981 collapsed nationwide and destabilized S&Ls. In Texas, TA1986 combined with oil deflation and lender liability to drive banks, S&Ls, and FSLIC insolvent. The situation deteriorated as Texan courts affirmed <italic>Texaco</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> tort liability and forced it into bankruptcy in 1987. While <italic>Berkshire </italic>bought <italic>Texaco</italic>\u2019s short-term debt, Texas did not follow her peers to reform tort law to limit lender liability claims until 1989.\nAs personal taxes fell, businesses shifted losses into corporates to deduct and income-generating gains into <italic>S-corps</italic> and partnerships, including real estate and oil. After losing TA1981\u2019s non-debt tax shield, firms demanded tax-deductible debt and so did investors as capital gains were less attractive. Preferences for disincorporation and debt financing combined into a private equity boom, particularly LBOs. While TA1986 eliminated GUD<italic>,</italic> LBOs continued disassembling conglomerates using tax-shielded debt and tax-free spinoffs. Moreover, domestic acquirers could sell divisions without reporting corporate gains, and Japanese taxpayers sold tax-free. \nTA1986 limited bank tax shelters by eliminating NOCs and limiting tax-exempt municipal debt and real estate loan loss reserves. Scrapping non-real estate borrowers\u2019 interest deductions, TA1986 added RMBS tax benefits, inflating California and New England housing. (In 1986, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic>\u2019s rival, <italic>Bank of New England</italic> (\u201cBNE\u201d), bought a real estate lender.) However, demand for HYB fell as corporates switched to partnerships and Japanese SLCs subsidized CP. So, bank loans and HYB pivoted to LBOs. \nAs Rohatyn<italic> </italic>blamed HYB and LBOs for crises, Congress denied him a new RFC. With an anti-hostile takeover fund, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York advised equity, debt-for-stock recaps, and ESOPs (incentivized by TA1986\u2019s lender tax breaks.) As equity soared, so did LBOs. While banks sold loans to Japan, LICs and mutual funds held most HYB. S&Ls held 7%, and DBL\u2019s client-investors\u2014whose market share of his issues fell since 1985\u2014bought HYB to hedge re-financing risk. While DBL\u2019s client-investor LICs held more, pensions bought LBO equity and debt. Buying California LICs and other insurers in 1985, Millikin\u2019s cousin <italic>Zenith</italic> insurance Chair Stanley Zax became President of California\u2019s insurance association by 1987.\nTA1986\u2019s lower corporate tax made equities more attractive to tax-free investors, HYB and private placements, and reduced cash flow HYB (\u201cRCF\u201d)\u2014offered high yield at lower risk. As HYB competition grew, DBL remained the market maker and expanded into high yield CP, sovereign, and municipal debt,  and employee LBOs via ESOPs.\nBy the end of 1986, an appeals court permitted commercial banks to engage in limited investment banking, fueling the securities firms\u2019 ire at competition. Congress reacted to insolvent S&Ls and the feud between banks and securities firms with DA1987. DA1987 reorganized FSLIC and created bridge banks as an alternative to receivership. \nConcerning FA1933, DA1987 placed a moratorium on FRS\u2019 extension of investment banking powers to banks, but eased BHC lease restrictions. Instead of out-of-court IT settlements, DOJ\u2019s Giuliani indicted employees from <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>Kidder</italic>, <italic>Sullivan</italic>, and <italic>Wachtell</italic> under RICO, driving a hedge fund out of business without a jury trial. Boesky pleaded guilty to securities fraud and agreed to assist in cornering other malefactors. \nAfter the Court held state anti-takeover laws unconstitutional in 1982, states continued experimenting as LBOs grew. Massachusetts enacted such a law when <italic>Revlon</italic> went after <italic>Gillette</italic>. The IT scandal changed this, and the Court approved a state\u2019s law, anti-takeover measures spread in 1987. The scandal also may have led <italic>Goldman</italic> to hire <italic>Sullivan</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s M&A and Litigation Partner Robert Katz as General Counsel. (It is unknown if he is a Katz-descendant.) Still, the boom continued, even as FRS tightened rates. \nReversing their American bank investments in 1987, Hong Kong\u2019s <italic>First Pacific</italic> sold <italic>Hibernia Bank</italic>, pivoting to less regulated Asia. As <italic>McKinsey</italic> helped <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>American Express</italic>\u2019 <italic>Shearson </italic><italic>Lehman</italic> <italic>Kuhn </italic>raise funds in Japan, Felix Rohatyn suggest the same as <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>\u2019s <italic>MINERAL</italic> sought to divest <italic>Salomon</italic> due to TA1986, but <italic>Salomon</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Chair Gutfreund<italic> </italic>turned the plan down. After serving on <italic>Engelhard</italic>\u2019s board, Rohatyn served on <italic>MINERAL</italic> before Glanville replaced him in late 1986, while another <italic>Lazard</italic> partner remained. \nWhile selling out of South Africa to <italic>DeBeers</italic>, <italic>MINERAL</italic> expanded into American mining. So, a raider made an offer for one of <italic>MINERAL</italic>\u2019s minority owned <italic>Newmont</italic>. Rohatyn thwarted the takeover with a dividend payout as part of a new reorg. Over the following years, <italic>Newmont</italic> sold oil and coal to focus on gold. Similarly, <italic>AMAX</italic> bought back aluminum interests sold to <italic>Mitsui</italic> in 1974, entered the gold market, and withdrew from all other commodities but coal. \nBut while Rohatyn searched for friendly <italic>Salomon</italic> buyers in 1987, raider Ron Perelman got wind through CSFB. At the time, CSFB\u2019s Wasserstein saw his odds of leading the firm fall. He considered leaving with Perella and fellow M&A bankers to accept Felix Rohatyn\u2019s invitation to <italic>Lazard</italic>, or join <italic>Dillon</italic>, or start his own firm. Ultimately, he remained, aiming to become CEO within a year and Chair within five years. \nAs Wasserstein advised Perelman\u2019s attempted purchase of <italic>MINERAL</italic>\u2019s minority interest in <italic>Salomon</italic>, speculation spread he would become <italic>Salomon</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s CEO. As <italic>Salomon</italic>\u2019s Gutfreund wanted a long-term investor instead of a raider with a minority interest, he<italic> </italic>completed a friendly takeover with<italic> Berkshire</italic>\u2019s Buffet, preventing Perelman\u2019s acquisition. Nevertheless, Wasserstein and Perelman remained partners in a renal-therapy company. \nAfter <italic>Hutton</italic> sold her LIC to California\u2019s <italic>First Capital</italic> LIC in 1986, <italic>American Express</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Shearson </italic><italic>Lehman</italic> <italic>Kuhn </italic>bought <italic>Hutton</italic> with advice from <italic>Blackstone</italic> and <italic>Salomon </italic>in late 1987 and <italic>First Capital</italic> LIC seven months later<italic>.</italic> Since <italic>Safra</italic> sold <italic>Trade Development Bank of Switzerland</italic> to <italic>American Express</italic>, his other banks continued competing, fueling bad blood grew. As right-wing antisemitic newspapers linked <italic>Safra</italic> to CIA, Iran, and cocaine in 1988, <italic>American Express</italic> apologized for slander after evidence surfaced.\nThe acquisitions also spurred senior bankers to set out on start boutiques. <italic>Salomon</italic>\u2019s Vice Chair Lewis Ranieri soon co-founded boutique investment firm <italic>Ranieri Wilson</italic> alongside Kendrick Wilson. After spending eight years at <italic>Salomon</italic>, Wilson took charge of <italic>Hutton</italic>\u2019s corporate finance group for ten months before <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s purchase. The Episcopalian Wilsons had been prominent ship chandlers in New York since the 1860s.\nAs SEC Chair David Ruder requested Congress to grant the agency the power to override state anti-takeover laws in October, the <italic>House Ways & Means Committee</italic> approved a tax bill to restrict hostile takeovers. The bill spurred stock sell-offs\u2014exacerbated by futures index insurance that did not have market makers like the underlying stocks and excused from\u2014and spread globally. Since FRS Chair Volcker did not seek a third term, new FRS Chair Alan Greenspan quelled the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic> by flooding banks and nonbanks with liquidity and organized securities firm rescues. \nHaving lost their trading monopolies, <italic>Jefferies</italic> and <italic>Madoff</italic> supplemented their businesses. While the former focused on LBOs, the latter on Jewish-targeted wealth management. By 1987, Boyd Jefferies resigned after being implicated in securities violations. Although ownership of <italic>Jefferies</italic> changed over the years, the brand thrived for decades. Madoff also faced losses from the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic>, and became a Ponzi scheme after.\nAs the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic> squeezed British FHCs, HSBC bought the rest of New York bank <italic>Marine Midland</italic> and a minority interest in <italic>Midland</italic> <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> to avoid a hostile takeover. From America, although presumably with Jacob Rothschild\u2019s RIT, Steinberg\u2019s <italic>Reliance</italic> LIC tried to takeover <italic>Warburg</italic> London in 1987. \nBy then, <italic>Warburg</italic> had several kinterlinks with BOE, including the sons of BOE Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton and Deputy Governor George Blunden. After <italic>Warburg</italic> became a discount house in 1988, Blunden\u2019s son, the head of money markets, ran it. Likewise, former <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg </italic>banker David Loehnis\u2014Geddes-cousin Donald Anderson\u2019s son-in-law and a fifth great nephew of James Coutts\u2014was a BOE Executive Director focusing on Overseas operations until leaving for <italic>Warburg</italic> in 1989.\nFinally, Congress pivoted from anti-takeover to tax corporate gains on LBO spin-offs (like <italic>Beatrice</italic>) with . Moreover, TA1987 limited TA1986\u2019s limited partnerships benefits to oil pipes. Although mergers subsided briefly, LBOs soon accelerated to new heights and spurred swaps to fix rates on floating bank loans and FX. UST and FRS allowed banks to deal swaps and underwrite securities despite DA1987, but disagreed about bank loan securitizations. So, <italic>McKinsey</italic> continued advocating loan securitizations to reduce bank risk. \nAfter appointing <italic>Dillon</italic> Chair Nicholas Brady to head of a commission investigating the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic>, President Reagan named him UST Secretary in late 1988. Brady hired a fellow Catholic from <italic>Dillon</italic>, Jerome Powell. Descended from Scottish aristocracy and with a DC legal lineage, Powell graduated from <italic>Princeton</italic> in and <italic>Georgetown</italic> Law by 1979 and joined <italic>Davis Polk</italic> in 1981 and then <italic>Dillon </italic>in 1984, where he remained until 1990. That year, he became Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance. In 1992, President Bush nominated him as Under Secretary of UST. He worked on a banking bill and led a report on government securities auctions. In 1993, he joined <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> and returned to <italic>Dillon</italic> in 1995.\nHaving purchased <italic>Allied Stores</italic> in 1986, Robert Campeau sold assets to keep only choice brands, and entered a bidding war with <italic>Macy</italic> for <italic>Federated Department Stores</italic>. He won with financing from CSFB\u2019s Wasserstein with funds from <italic>Dillon</italic>, <italic>Paine Webber</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, and <italic>Sumitomo</italic>. Wasserstein encouraged Campeau to sell <italic>Brooks Brothers</italic> and <italic>Ann Taylor</italic> to repay loans from <italic>Bank of </italic>Wasserstein and <italic>Paribas</italic> as the equity for <italic>Federated</italic>. With the transaction, Campeau controlled New York\u2019s <italic>Bloomingdale</italic>, <italic>Abraham Straus</italic> and <italic>Stern,</italic> New England\u2019s <italic>Jordan Marsh</italic>; Florida\u2019s <italic>Burdines</italic> and <italic>Maas/Jordan Marsh</italic>; Atlanta\u2019s <italic>Rich/Goldsmith</italic>; Cincinnati\u2019s <italic>Lazarus</italic>; and Seattle\u2019s <italic>Bon Marche</italic>.\nSince <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s trading scandal led to the resignation of top executives in 1977, former <italic>Lazard</italic> New York partner Swiss-born Rainer Gut rose to second in control. After forming CSFB with Joseph Perella<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic>Bruce Wasserstein\u2019s CSFB, Gut progressed from <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s executive board Deputy in 1983 to Chair in 1986 and CSFB Chair by 1988. Under Gut\u2019s leadership, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> away from traditional Swiss banking to global investment banking and money management, growing assets 300%. The bank also expanded its reach through acquisitions, acquiring <italic>Effectenbank</italic> in West Germany and entering trust banking in Japan. His board directorates included <italic>Nestl\u00e9</italic>, <italic>Swiss Re</italic>, <italic>Ciba Geigy</italic>, BGGE, <italic>Pechiney</italic>, <italic>Union Carbide</italic>, and <italic>Daimler Benz</italic><italic>.</italic>\nHowever, the Swiss corporate network of interlocking directorates soon declined. Shifts in business strategies, such as reducing close ties and the arrival of foreign managers, altered the network\u2019s structure. Additionally, changes in global economics weakened Swiss shareholders\u2019 influence, while leading banks redirected focus towards more profitable markets, distancing themselves from industrial companies. And since the founding families of <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> were pushed out by the 1960s, private banks like <italic>Pictet</italic> experienced similar professionalization by the 1980s.\nDuring this time, CSFB hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> to advise on strategic direction since Wasserstein and Perella sought to expand merchant banking operations, while the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic> decreased management risk appetite. Along with their M&A team, Wasserstein and Perella resigned to form <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic>. Meanwhile, investment banks began expanding their Midwest operations. By 1987, William Lewis helped open <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Chicago office. \nHaving left with Black banker Raymond McGuire from CSFB, <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic> selected him to open CSFB Chicago. Likewise, Rohatyn hired away Ira Harris from <italic>Salomon</italic> to open <italic>Lazard</italic> Chicago in 1988. Harris grew up poor in the Bronx to become a leading Midwestern banker. Harris immedicably hired Patrick Callahan from CSFB\u2019s Chicago office. Callahan\u2019s wife was related to Chicago\u2019s first Catholic Mayor and <italic>Moore</italic>\u2019s former financial manager, who then became a director of <italic>Chicago Trust</italic>.\nBy 1984, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York hired <italic>Georgetown Uni</italic> graduate Jenny Sullivan. Born outside of Chicago, Sullivan came from a notable Irish Catholic family. Her grandfather co-founded <italic>Skil</italic>, which produced the first portable electric saw. Another grandfather and her uncle led the law firm <italic>Winston Strawn</italic>, representative of <italic>Beatrice</italic>. She is also a relation of Rushton Skakel, brother of Ethel Kennedy. Despite rising to a VP of M&A at <italic>Lazard</italic> New York, she retired after marrying Mark Sanford in 1989, and managed his successful campaigns for Congress from 1994. \nBy 1987, a proposed merger between <italic>Braniff</italic> and <italic>Pan Am</italic> airlines failed, leading Pritzker to sell <italic>Braniff</italic> <italic>Air</italic>. As long term clients of Ira Harris, Pritzker hired <italic>Lazard</italic> to represent them against KKR, <italic>American Express Shearson</italic> <italic>Lehman </italic><italic>Kuhn</italic>, <italic>Merrill</italic>, and <italic>Forstmann Little</italic> in bidding for RJR. Since German <italic>Hoechst</italic> bought out<italic> Celanese</italic> in 1987 and forced him out, Macomber joined fellow RJR director Vernon Jordan hired <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s Rohatyn advised. To avoid competition, KKR hired <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic> without <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. \nAt the end, Japanese banks and LICs lent twice as much as American banks or DBL\u2019s HYB to finance KKR\u2019s record LBO of conglomerate RJR. KKR hired <italic>McKinsey </italic>alum Lou Gerstner from <italic>American Express</italic> to lead RJR after. By early 1988, FRS resumed interest rate hikes. Still, LBOs continued. Despite Rohatyn concerns, <italic>Lazard</italic> New York issued HYB. Long having advised Sanford Weill, Ira Harris recommended his <italic>Commercial Credit</italic> take over the larger and diversified <italic>Primerica</italic> financial conglomerate (formerly <italic>American Can</italic>) in 1988. As Frank Zarb left <italic>Lazard</italic> that year to rejoin his old mentor at <italic>Smith Barney</italic> to buy <italic>Primerica</italic>. \nOil deflated after the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic> and higher interest rates. By 1988, Saudi <italic>Rajhi</italic> moneychanger became a commercial bank, and soon after, went public, becoming the third-largest bank in Saudi Arabia. However, political change in Lebanon led to a regime change. Despite Roger Tamraz\u2019s efforts to broker a peace deal, Tamraz\u2019s banking empire faced a tumultuous period marked by the collapse of <italic>Machrek Bank</italic> and <italic>First Phoenician Bank</italic> in late 1988, with <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of Lebanon</italic> intervening to manage the debts. As Gemayel\u2019s term ended, Tamraz faced escalating legal issues, leading to his flight from Lebanon. He departed following a kidnapping by a pro-Syrian Hezbollah, which tortured him until he paid a ransom, prompting him to abandon hopes in Lebanon and eventually settle in America, where he continued investing in oil ventures.\nAs French socialists lost power in 1986, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris finally gained a banking license. Within months, a French Rothchild heiress married an Italian Count, becoming an in-law of Gianni Agnelli, whose <italic>Fiat </italic>was buying <italic>Alfa Romeo</italic> and <italic>Maserati</italic> with <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> assistance, which itself was expanding. To stave off takeovers, Racamier\u2019s <italic>Louis Vuitton</italic> merged with <italic>Mo\u00ebt Hennessy</italic> to create <italic>Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt-Hennessy</italic> (\u201cLVMH\u201d) in 1987. By 1988, Italy restructured <italic>MedioBanca</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> shareholder base to reduce her power. As state-owned bank shares sold <italic>MedioBanca </italic>shares, they invested in other banks, and floated <italic>MedioBanca</italic> on the public market, while Enrico Cuccia stepped down to honorary Chair. \nSince 1985, Wendel cousin Michel Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet joined <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 Executive Committee and became Chair of <italic>Paribas</italic> North America. The following year, he was appointed CEO of <italic>Co Financi\u00e8re</italic>, playing a key role in <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 becoming the first privatized bank in 1987 and international expansion. As <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 takeover bid for <italic>Co de Navigation Mixte</italic> failed in 1989, Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet became Chair of the Supervisory Board of <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 HC, <italic>Financi\u00e8re</italic>, and the boards of <italic>Total</italic>, LVMH, and <italic>Schneider</italic>. Instead, Andr\u00e9 Levy-Lang from <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 <italic>Co</italic> <italic>Bancaire</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Parisienne</italic> took over operational control.\nDavid Dautresme, of <italic>Paribas</italic>\u2019 <italic>Cr\u00e9dit du Nord</italic>, however, joined <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris by 1986. Soon after, <italic>Lazard</italic> acquired a 30% stake in <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel, having partnered in the 1920s. By then, socialists reclaimed MOF by 1988 and BNP remained nationalized. Although <italic>Lazard </italic>Paris<italic>\u2019</italic> Jean-Marie Messier launched France\u2019s first LBO, BNP was more active, partnering with a local insurer, Hungarian bank, and British real estate bank. \nMessier worked alongside Patrick Sayer, who joined <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris as an authorized signatory after graduation and worked on buyouts while assisting his father, Louis. Louis had managed flour and wine companies in Algeria before fleeing with other Jews to France in the 1960s, where he diversified into real estate, wineries, and <italic>F\u00e9lix Potin</italic> with <italic>Paribas</italic> financing. The failure of <italic>F\u00e9lix Potin</italic> forced Louis to liquidate other ventures, but Patrick advanced to Partner at <italic>Lazard</italic>. \nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic>, <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic> sold a 1.5% stake to <italic>Sumitomo</italic> LIC, and <italic>Consolidated Gold</italic> bought a 50% interest in <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic> Energy. In 1988, AIG bought 5.3% of <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic>. In 1988, <italic>MINERAL</italic>, a subsidiary of <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>, began taking over <italic>Consolidated Gold</italic> with the help of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York. However, the takeover was unsuccessful due to American antitrust legislation, and instead, <italic>Hanson</italic>, a British conglomerate, acquired <italic>Consolidated</italic>. \nIn early 1989, Weill\u2019s son-in-law, Edouard Stern, bought <italic>Consolidated</italic> shares. This led to an investigation by the British Department of Trade & Industry for potential insider trading. The Department concluded that there was no evidence suggesting that <italic>Lazard</italic> had any knowledge of <italic>Stern</italic>\u2019s transactions. However, The Department found that Edouard failed in reporting. Despite opposition from partners, Weill described the investigation as a \u2018learning experience\u2019 and decided to hire Edouard. \nBy 1988, lawsuits against investment banks grew to corporations and shareholders doubting the reliability of their advice in major transactions, such as mergers and acquisitions. A Florida court found <italic>Prudential Bache</italic> guilty of negligence in advising <italic>Rawson Food Services</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> purchase of supermarkets from <italic>MacAndrews Forbes</italic>. After IRS charged Victor Posner with tax evasion, In SEC accused him and his son of colluding with Boesky and Milken in a scheme to take over <italic>Fischbach Corp</italic> in 1984 They allegedly concealed their plan by \u2018parking\u2019 stock with Boesky. While Boesky and Milken pled guilty to related felony charges, DOJ\u2019s Giuliani led charges against DBL and threatened to use RICO. As the Court again deemed SEC\u2019s IT approaches unconstitutional to non-insiders, Congress used political headwinds to enact SA1988 late in the year. \nSA1988 codified the private right of action against securities fraud, extending liability to firms and individuals with the power to influence or control management, and multiplying penalties. Since SA1988 did not define the law\u2019s goal, the Court eased the burden of proof by creating the \u2018fraud-on-the-market\u2019 presumption of reliance on public disclosures. (Since IT remained legal for policy makers, including members of Congress and FRS, damaging the integrity of governmental actors with corruption.) DBL complied with Giuliani before the end of 1988. They accepted a fine, fired Milken, and allowed on-site supervision. However, as TA1986 took hold, DBL could not roll over real estate high yield CP, and HYB yields rose as firms defaulted. \nAfter TA1986, startups could not sell NOCs, while their employees faced higher capital gains, and their investors could not deduct passive losses. As investments became shorter, more indebted, and less high-tech, exits shifted from IPOs to Japanese buyouts. By 1989, <italic>Rockefeller </italic>sold much of <italic>ROCK</italic> to <italic>Mitsubishi</italic>. With this, the New England high-tech export hub lost ground to Japan. After being downgraded in 1986, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic>-funded <italic>Wang</italic> <italic>Laboratories</italic> losses grew. By late 1988, high-tech employment in New England slowed. \nBefore <italic>Wang</italic> restructured debts with her creditors in late 1989, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic> bought <italic>Bank Vermont</italic> in 1987 and wrote off loans during the Third World debt crisis in 1987 along with other large banks. Although mortgage delinquencies rose, BNE remained profitable by diversifying with national commercial real estate debt. To stabilize real estate, FDIC exempted swaps from bank receivership stays in early 1989, and FRS retained an easy policy after Japan raised interest rates to curb land prices. Preparing for a wave of privatizations, America, joined France and Japan created <italic>European Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> (\u201cEBRD\u201d) in 1989, as a sort of mix of EC, <italic>BANK</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic>. \nWhile <italic>American Express</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Shearson </italic><italic>Lehman</italic> <italic>Kuhn </italic>created unbundled stock units\u2014low-taxable bond and preferred stock hybrids\u2014 SEC forced them and their marketing partner, <italic>Goldman</italic>, to abandoned the instrument within four months in March 1989. The following month, a DBL investor-client S&L declared bankruptcy to avoid seizure by FHS. Congress reacted with the  (\u201cDA1989\u201d). DA1989 fused FSLIC into FDIC, which supervised a new thrift deposit insurance fund,<italic> Resolution Trust Corp</italic> (\u201cRTC\u201d), to dispose of failed S&Ls. Replacing FHLB, DA1989 created <italic>Office of Thrift Services</italic> within UST to regulate all federally insured S&Ls. \nWhile S&L swaps became stay exempt, nonbanks remained subject to it. DA1989 also voided DA1982\u2019s goodwill as capital and incited fire sales of HYB and construction loans by limiting S&L investments to residential real estate. (DA1989\u2019s intention was to deflate DA1982\u2019s generous terms and the Court ruled that the government had breached their contract with S&Ls by 1996.) Concurrently, FRS, FDIC, and UST\u2019s OCC scrutinized <italic>highly leveraged transactions</italic> and Congress limited RCF tax deductions. LBOs and S&Ls collapsed. Similarly, regulators destabilized New England real estate by forcing BNE to write down losses and sell assets. \nSince DBL continued to make markets for HYB, SEC forced mark-to-market pricing. So, rating agencies downgraded their CP, and creditors ran. In early 1990, DBL declared bankruptcy. Despite FRS and SEC managing the process and Sanford Weil\u2019s <italic>Smith Barney</italic> bought 16 DBL offices with 400 financiers, markets and financing destabilized as investors ran from HYB, high yield CP, S&Ls, and sovereigns. While <italic>Bank of Yugoslavia</italic> had deposited FX, <italic>Bank of Portugal</italic> lost more by renting gold to DBL. Portugal soon nationalized her <italic>National Overseas Bank</italic>, the only issuing and commercial bank in the gold-port of Macao. \nAfter DBL-associated <italic>Executive </italic>LIC paid out over a billion in policy surrenders in 1989, <italic>American Express</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> </italic>California-based <italic>First Capital</italic> LIC filed for bankruptcy by 1991. As state insurance regulators limited private placements from early 1990, issuance collapsed. With the failure of <italic>Executive</italic> LIC, pensioners and annuitants, including <italic>Cannon Mills</italic> retirees, received only 70% of their entitled benefits, forcing David Murdock to cover the 30% shortfall.<italic> Zenith</italic> insurer, run by Milken\u2019s cousin Stanley Zax, survived by re-focused on workers compensation.\nThere were also winners. After finishing the <italic>Nabisco</italic> deal, DBL\u2019s M&A chief Leon Black, the son of <italic>Lehman</italic> alum Eli Blachowitz, left with his brother-in-law Anthony Ressler, John Kissick, Joshua Harris, Marc Rowan, and others to start <italic>Apollo</italic> LBO. <italic>Apollo</italic>\u2019s largest transaction in their first year was <italic>Executive </italic>LIC\u2019s HYB portfolio. Without access to DBL and CSFB, <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic>\u2019s Hamilton James extended $2.5 billion in eleven bridge loans through <italic>Equitable</italic> LIC, which owned <italic>Donaldson</italic> since 1985. By 1990, <italic>Donaldson </italic>hired over 20 DBL bankers. Among their largest deals was the takeover of <italic>Chicago & Northwestern</italic> RR alongside <italic>Blackstone</italic>. The same year, <italic>Blackstone</italic> formed <italic>Hospitality Franchise Systems</italic> to buy hotels distressed by TA1986 and the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>.\nAs Kenneth Moelis became <italic>Donaldson</italic>\u2019s director of corporate finance, he brought eight DBL specialists. In 1994, <italic>Apollo</italic> obtained a $50 million bridge loan for <italic>United International Holdings</italic> from <italic>Donaldson</italic>, later completing over $400 million in financings. That year, DBL alums Mark Attanasio and Robert Beyer at <italic>Trust Co of the West</italic> provided debt for <italic>Apollo</italic>, including <italic>Empire Kosher Poultry</italic>. <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, with DBL-alum Ted Virtue, invested with <italic>Apollo</italic> in supermarket deals and the acquisition of <italic>Big Flower Press</italic>. In 1997, DBL-alum  Jonathan Coslet of <italic>Texas Pacific Group</italic> acquired <italic>J. Crew</italic> with financing from <italic>Donaldson</italic> and <italic>Trust Co of the West</italic>. DBL alums led the industry over the next two decades, with Kissick and Black\u2019s son-in-law Ressler co-founding <italic>Ares</italic>, Attanasio co-founding <italic>Crescent</italic>, Moelis starting <italic>Moelis</italic>, and Virtue founding <italic>MidOcean</italic> \nMeanwhile, employee LBOs ESOPs soared for <italic>Pan Am</italic> and other airlines. To prevent a hostile takeover attempt by <italic>Texas International Airlines</italic>, <italic>Trans World Airlines</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> union joined Carl Icahn. While Japanese bankers bought bank loans from <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>\u2019s sponsored <italic>Northwest Airlines</italic>, they refused <italic>Lazard</italic> Chicago-advised <italic>United Airlines</italic>\u2019 employee LBO ESOP with <italic>Chase</italic> and <italic>Citi</italic> bank loans, leaving <italic>Citi</italic> holding a <italic>highly confident letter</italic> amidst the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic> as they fled HYB. Buying shares of <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic>, and <italic>Chemical</italic> NB, Saudi Prince Walid Solh Saud acquired <italic>Citi</italic> Saudi Arabia and a 4.9% stake in <italic>Citi</italic> in 1990, which he increased to 15% by 1991. Edmond Safra refused to buy <italic>Chase</italic>, saying \u201c<italic>The market value was such that I could have afforded. But no Jew should own the largest bank in a non-Jewish country. That is what my father taught me</italic>.\u201d\nSimilarly, as CSFB held \u2018toxic\u2019 bridge loan in 1989, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> fully absorbed her. Unable to meet debt payments amidst a severe cash shortage, Campeau, <italic>Allied</italic>, and <italic>Federated</italic> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 1990, marking the largest mercantile catastrophe in American history. Bruce Wasserstein faced criticism for his role in orchestrating the complex deals and overpaying for <italic>Federated</italic>. Campeau\u2019s decision to use proceeds from asset sales to buy <italic>Federated</italic> led to accusations of fraudulent conveyance. As more boutiques folded, <italic>Ranieri Wilson</italic> shuttered in less than two years later. Kendrick Wilson joined <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in 1989, where he advised on financial institutions.\nAs banks and a Japanese LIC ran from KKR\u2019s RJR HYB, <italic>Lazard</italic> feared legal ramification of buying equity. KKR survived by calling on pensions to recap RJR and holding unto shares for five more years. Likewise, KKR pivoted to leveraged buildups and minority investments. Acquiring a part of <italic>Macmillan</italic> publisher in 1989, KKR owned most of the equity of over 52 additional acquisitions by 1997. By 1990, RJR shareholders accused<italic> Lazard</italic> and <italic>Dillon</italic> of reckless advice to accept KKR\u2019s bid. These legal challenges pressured investment banks to justify fees and the value of their services in subsequent years. While <italic>McKinsey</italic>-alum Lou Gerstner left RJR by 1993 to lead IBM per Vernon Jordan\u2019s reference. RJR hired her <italic>Davis Polk</italic> attorney as CEO.\nOutside of finance, Japanese and media transactions continued. By 1989, <italic>Allen</italic> advised on <italic>Coca Cola</italic>\u2019s sale of <italic>Columbia Pictures</italic> (which they sold to them 1982) to <italic>Sony</italic>. In 1990, Rohatyn facilitated the acquisitions of entertainment giant MCA by Japanese electrical company <italic>Matsushita</italic>, <italic>Warner </italic>by <italic>Time </italic>(along with <italic>American Express</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Shearson</italic>), clothing retailer <italic>Limited</italic> by <italic>Bergdorf Goodman</italic>, and <italic>Paramount</italic> by <italic>Viacom</italic>, a part of Sumner Redstone\u2019s <italic>National Amusements</italic>. \nSince Japan\u2019s <italic>Diet</italic> restricted real estate lending in April, BOJ hiked rates by August as Iraq invaded Kuwait. While the Soviet Union joined America and the international community in the <italic>Gulf War</italic>, domestic <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</italic> stores and international oil stockpiles established after the 1973 embargo mitigated supply disruptions, resulting in oil prices 30% above prewar levels into 1992. Without such reserves, emerging markets like India watched FX reserves fall below a month\u2019s worth of imports by June 1991 along with industrial production as inflation soared. Amidst the crisis, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Rodney Wagner arranged a syndicated loan for Saudi Arabia to cover war costs.\nAirlines particularly suffered, with bankruptcies including <italic>Eastern </italic>(1989), <italic>Braniff</italic> (1989), <italic>Continental </italic>(1990), <italic>Pan Am</italic> (1991), <italic>Midway </italic>(1991), <italic>America West </italic>(1991), and <italic>Trans World </italic>(1992). As David Bonderman bought <italic>Continental</italic> out of bankruptcy in 1993, he formed private equity TPG to buy bankrupts. While airlines were unable to tap NOCs since TA1986,  expanded protection to non \u2018true\u2019 leases, driving GE and AIG airline financing. TPG-like transactions became popular after the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>.\nWhile Congress exempted nonbank swaps from automatic stays with BA1990,  taxed reorgs. FRS contracted lending by tightening regulatory capital. Bankruptcies spread as small business lending and merger finance collapsed. Despite FRS liquidity infusions, more banks failed. As Rhode Island folded deposit insurance, New England depositors ran. FDIC nationalized BNE and most of New Hampshire\u2019s banks. \nWith growing panic, regulators eased ERISA for pensions to buy risky assets. Unable to turn to DBL for HYB,<italic> </italic><italic>Fairfield Cable</italic>\u2019s principal lenders, <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic>, faced large real estate loan losses, and <italic>Fairfield</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> credit line in August 1990, soon leading to the largest bankruptcy in the state\u2019s history. Most LBOs reorged without disruption using debtor-in-possession debt that FRS did not count as <italic>highly leveraged transactions</italic>. \nBy 1990, <italic>Bank of America</italic> promoted California-head Richard Rosenberg to CEO and Chair, perhaps the most senior Jew in banking. While <italic>Bank </italic>of <italic>America</italic> and <italic>First NB of Boston </italic>bid to buy BNE from FDIC in 1991, they lost out as KKR allied with <italic>Fleet Norstar</italic> BHC with a higher bid before KKR took additional passive minority positions in <italic>ConAgra</italic>, <italic>Texaco</italic>, and <italic>First Interstate Bancorp</italic>. Still, <italic>Bank of America</italic> acquired <italic>Security Pacific</italic> within a year in the biggest banking merger ever, becoming the nation\u2019s second-largest bank. The same year, FRS, FDIC, and UST\u2019s OCC ended <italic>highly leveraged transactions</italic> scrutiny and rules. Congress eased DA1989 restrictions, and the Court held goodwill reversal unconstitutional. \nLike KKR, other private equity competed with BHCs. As part of Texan oil magnate Robert Bass\u2019 LBO, David Bonderman acquired <italic>American Savings Bank</italic> in 1988. His implementation of a good bank/bad bank model set a precedent for similar strategies in the industry and Bonderman\u2019s future TPG. After selling <italic>American Savings Bank</italic> to <italic>Washington Mutual </italic>in 1996, Bonderman gained a <italic>Washington Mutual</italic> board seat. While initially selling large property pools, RTC began offering smaller pools to more investors in 1993. So, Bass joined with John Grayken\u2019s <italic>Lone Star Funds</italic> to acquire half-a-billion S&L mortgage portfolios from RTC by 1995, later achieving a 77% return.\nAfter leaving the DOJ, Rudolph Giuliani ran for mayor of New York City in 1989 but lost to David Dinkins, who became the city\u2019s first Black mayor. By 1991, courts had acquitted Milken, but the city was facing a fiscal crisis following the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>. In response, Dinkins proposed a $29 billion budget for 1991, which included $2 billion in cuts. To address the budget shortfall, he sought relief from the state\u2019s <italic>Municipal Assistance Corp</italic> (\u201cMAC\u201d) through a $1 billion bond refinancing plan. However, MAC Chair Felix Rohatyn blocked this proposal, citing concerns about a potential credit downgrade.\nDinkins then considered service cuts, but unexpectedly, higher tax revenues and lower-than-anticipated state aid cuts led to a $200 million surplus in 1992. As a result, he abandoned plans to borrow from MAC. In 1993, Dinkins introduced a $31 billion budget to address a $2 billion gap, relying on $530 million in unconfirmed state and federal aid. This move drew criticism from fiscal experts and political opponents, including Giuliani, who pointed out Dinkins\u2019 failure to resolve long-term financial issues. That year, Giuliani became mayor of New York City, aided by contributions from <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>Dillon</italic>, and other bankers.\nAs SEC investigated <italic>Salomon</italic>\u2019s CEO John Meriwether for not supervising false bids,<italic> Berkshire</italic>\u2019s Buffett became CEO. Likewise, <italic>McKinsey </italic>alumni reorganized the financial sector. Since selling <italic>Coldwell </italic>Commercial to an MBO and <italic>Carlyle </italic>in 1989, <italic>Sears</italic> sold <italic>Coldwell </italic>Residential to <italic>Fremont Financial</italic> (which securitized the pool via<italic> Merrill</italic>), <italic>Coldwell </italic>Mortgage to PNC NB, <italic>Allstate </italic>in an IPO, and <italic>Dean Witter</italic> as a spin-off by 1993, GE sold <italic>Kidder</italic> for alleged fraud in 1994. Losses since the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic> by rescuing a California LIC in 1992, <italic>American Express</italic> sold <italic>Boston Co </italic>in 1992 to <italic>Mellon Bank</italic> and James Robinson retired<italic>, </italic>and<italic> McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Harvey Golub took over in 1993. \nBy 1994, Golub sold <italic>American Express</italic>\u2019 <italic>Shearson Loeb</italic>\u2019s retail brokers to Sanford Weill\u2019s <italic>Smith Barney</italic> and spun-off <italic>Allstate Insurance</italic>, <italic>First Data</italic>, and <italic>Lehman</italic>. Likewise, after rising mortgage defaults forced <italic>Travelers</italic> business insurer to sell <italic>Dillon</italic> to <italic>Baring </italic>in 1991, <italic>Smith Barney</italic> merged with <italic>Travelers</italic> by late 1993. After buying several hotel chains, <italic>Blackstone</italic> spun off <italic>Hospitality Franchise Systems</italic> by 1993. And as <italic>Coldwell</italic> Commercial went public in 1996 to fuel expansion, <italic>Hospitality Franchise Systems</italic> bought it.\nAnd following depressed volumes since the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic>, gold brokers reorganized. While Bruce Wasserstein<italic> </italic>advised <italic>Swiss Bank Corp-</italic>UBS merger in 1988, HSBC bought the rest of <italic>Midland</italic> <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic> in 1992, and <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> bought <italic>Sharp Pixley</italic> from <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic> in 1993. And as <italic>Safra</italic> bought <italic>Westpac Johnson</italic>,<italic> Anglo-American Co</italic> sold half of <italic>Johnson </italic>to <italic>Barclay</italic> and UBS. After a scandal that <italic>Standard Charted Mocatta Goldsmid</italic> bribed officials in Asia per local custom in 1994,<italic> Standard Chartered</italic> sold<italic> Mocatta Goldsmid</italic> to <italic>Bank of Nova Scotia</italic> in 1997. \nSince 1994, Sam Jonah turned Ghana\u2019s <italic>Ashanti Goldfields</italic> into an African privatization model through futures contracts to stabilize gold prices, growing production by 40% via acquisitions. Having joined <italic>Warburg </italic>London in 1987, James Sassoon, an heir of HSBC\u2019s founders, led UBS\u2019 privatization after 1995, he served as Vice Chair of Investment Banking until 2002. From there, Sassoon held various leadership roles in <italic>Exchequer</italic>. Likewise, soon after Robin Leigh-Pemberton stepped down as BOE Governor in 1993, his son James left <italic>Warburg</italic> London to join <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>.\nLikewise, Japan demonetized real estate by reforming bankruptcy, FA1933-like laws, pro-cartel bank interest rate controls, and tax laws on bank land-collateralized loans and bad loan accounting from 1991 to 1994. While <italic>Mitsubishi</italic> covered <italic>Rockefeller Center</italic>\u2019s partial cash shortfalls, <italic>ROCK</italic> filed for bankruptcy in 1995, which <italic>Goldman</italic> and David Rockefeller bought. As <italic>Mitsubishi </italic>merged with <italic>Bank of Tokyo </italic>to create the world\u2019s largest bank in 1995, their California subsidiaries, <italic>Union Bank </italic>and <italic>Bank of California</italic>, fused into California\u2019s fourth largest bank.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of Asia</italic>\nWhile WWII dissolved most multi-national Chinese bankers, OCBC (1932) faced new competition in financing import-substitution industrialization in the 1950s and 1960s, with branches in South-East Asia, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Across Southeast Asia and the Pacific Basin region, Overseas Chinese magnates employed a network for mutual dealings in commodities trading, property, and finance. Their adaptability and business acumen have allowed them to thrive, even in countries where they initially faced challenges as minority refugees. Especially in Indonesia and Thailand, the group learned to navigate economic and political landscapes discreetly, ensuring their continued growth and influence. \nIn countries like Thailand and Indonesia, entrepreneurs struggled to access information about machinery, relying on itinerant salesmen from advanced nations without established marketing connections. This pushed machinery manufacturers to invest directly instead of exporting. The Chinese business community in Indonesia acted as a crucial link, using family networks to connect local users with suppliers from Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. This facilitated trade, reduced costs, and often led to Chinese Indonesians owning machinery and leasing to native Indonesians.\nOverseas Chinese particularly assimilated into Buddhist Thailand. After a military coup in 1958, the Sarit government in Thailand implemented policies to promote industrialization with private capital. Restricting state enterprises to promote infant private industry and weaken their predecessors, the government provided incentives to investors, imposed high import duties to, and introduced economic plans and support from America, leading to significant industrial growth and the emergence of new domestic capitalist groups based on manufacturing industries, Chinese Thai led by Chen Sophonpanich\u2019s <italic>Bangkok Bank</italic>. While making 5-10% of the population, they controlled half of the financial sector, largely due to the government\u2019s policy of limiting foreign banks and promoting domestic banking, which grew 50-fold in the thirty years from 1960. Most local bankers in this sector were Chinese Thai, with extensive networks into other sectors of the economy, including agriculture and small businesses, due to marriage ties and interlocking directorships. \nKorea was even more extreme, continuing the roots of Japanese colonialism. Following the <italic>Korean War</italic>, the post-1961 military-backed state effectively enforced its economic policies, securing compliance from businesses in contrast to Japan\u2019s historical reliance on big business. The political executive in Korea, closely linked to the military, reduced dependency on corporate support. When Park assumed power, he detained corrupt businessmen from the Rhee regime, threatening asset confiscation and compelling them to establish new businesses and pay fines to evade asset seizure, including the seized bank shares. Unlike Japan, where businesses could influence elections by withdrawing support from politicians, in Korea, challenging the military-backed President would have required businesses to shut down, leading to potential ruin.\nPresident Park also promoted chaebols\u2014like Japanese zaibatsu\u2014with loans and incentives for large family-owned businesses.\u00a0Like aristocracies in other regions, chaebols were led by landlords who kinterlinked with competitors and the government. From a landlord family, Lee Byung-chul married a Japanese woman during the colonial era and founded <italic>Samsung</italic>. In 1948, his daughter married Jo Woon-hae, who was linked to Jo Beom-seok, the country\u2019s first PM. By 1958, Lee Byung-chul\u2019s son wed a high-ranking government official\u2019s daughter. Another daughter married Koo Cha-kyung, who would become Chair of LG. The families soon connected with <italic>Hyundai,</italic> founded in 1947 by Chung Ju-yung to service America\u2019s Army. Partnering with <italic>Ford</italic> to start <italic>Hyundai </italic><italic>Motor</italic> in 1967, <italic>Hyundai</italic> diversified into electronics and shipbuilding by 1972.\u00a0\nStill, HSBC remained the largest Asian bank. Although <italic>Jardine </italic>gained control of HSBC from the Iraq Jewish <italic>Sassoon</italic> in 1895, <italic>Kadoorie</italic>\u2014fellow Iraqi Jews\u2014gained control of <italic>China Light </italic>in 1928. After WWII, HSBC and led banks in lending, often without requiring collateral, to reputable firms, PUs, and Shanghai cotton spinners, funneling HK $50 million through <italic>China Engineers</italic>. By 1954, these banks collectively loaned up to 100 million to the cotton spinning industry, fostering its growth and profitability. \nHowever, after <italic>China Communist Party</italic> (\u201cCCP\u201d) expropriated mainland assets, Chinese bankers refocused on Hong Kong. While few native Chinese bankers established foreign branches, they relied on British HSBC and <italic>Mercantile Bank</italic>, which established a global presence by expanding their branch networks and acquiring other banks, continuing to serve as correspondent for the smaller Hong Kong native banks.\nAfter <italic>Kadoorie</italic> replaced <italic>Sassoon</italic> cousins at HSBC in 1956, the death Baron Sassoon in 1961 severed the direct male lineage of <italic>Sassoon</italic>. Instead, <italic>Liu</italic>, <italic>Far East</italic>, and other banks paid higher time deposit rates than HSBC to buy offices. After HSBC supported <italic>Liu</italic> and <italic>Far East</italic> from runs, HSBC secured <italic>Reg Q</italic>-like interest caps and a ban on new banks by 1964. <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s HEC split Hong Kong PUs with <italic>China Light</italic>. As PUs subsidized industry, calls to nationalize them for grew. In 1964, <italic>China Light </italic>and <italic>Exxon</italic> agreed to control. \nSince Robert Ho joined <italic>Jardine</italic> as a clerk in 1880, married a daughter of partner Alex Maclean, and became chief comprador in 1883, his family held the position. The Hos also kinterlinked with the Sassoons, serving as compradors for <italic>Sassoon</italic> and other institutions. Ho\u2019s son Edward led HSBC\u2019s compradors for over thirty years, serving as the bank\u2019s Chinese manager. Edward\u2019s son Joseph was born in Shanghai and graduated from <italic>Catholic Uni</italic> in America in 1953, served in the Army, and worked at <italic>Marine Midland Bank</italic> in New York from 1957 to 1960. \nAfter the deaths of his grandfather and father, Joseph moved to Hong Kong, developed commercial property holdings, and expanded American investments. He served on the boards of HSBC, <italic>Hong Kong Electric</italic>, and other firms. Joseph\u2019s second cousin, Hong Kong-born Stanley Ho fled to Macau after the Japanese invasion in 1941. There, he married the daughter of a Portuguese lawyer and made his first million trading machinery, rice, kerosene, and luxury goods by the end of WWII. In 1961, with backing from Henry Fok, he founded <italic>Sociedade de Turismo e Divers\u00f5es de Macau</italic>, securing a gambling monopoly that lasted four decades.\nWhile international Chinese banks did not branch in the Philippines due to competition challenges with domestic banks, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and\u2014after expulsion for Malaysia in 1965, the predominantly Chinese Singapore, had the most foreign branch banks and subsidiaries of the over 100 family-owned Chinese banks. Before, Khoo Puat joined other OCBC shareholders and executives to form <italic>Malayan Banking </italic>in 1960. \nGiven the variety of laws, Kwek Hong Png<italic> </italic>started <italic>Hong Leong</italic> in 1963 using a \u2018triangular family network\u2019. While his brother-in-law provided expertise in property development in Hong Kong and China, his Malaysian cousin financed transactions and insurance through <italic>Dao Heng Bank</italic> in Hong Kong, and in sourcing building materials through <italic>Hong Leong Industries</italic> in Malaysia.\nAlthough not a banker, Malaysia\u2019s most prominent Chinese financier, Robert Kuok, worked with other bankers, including Malaysia\u2019s Robert Kuok, a client of Chen Sophonpanich\u2019s <italic>Bangkok Bank</italic>. Born to a Chinese middle-class merchant in and educated at one of Malaya\u2019s finest schools, Kuok and his brother founded <italic>Kuok</italic> in 1949, focusing on rice, sugar, salt, flour, and other commodities. Their business expanded rapidly within Malaysia into imports and processing operations. In 1959, Kuok partnered with Malaysia\u2019s government-owned <italic>Federal Land Development Authority</italic> to establish <italic>Malaya Sugar Manufacturing Co</italic>. By the 1960s, he became Malaysia\u2019s primary sugar refiner. Kuok diversified into shipping, bank, insurance, plantation, and property development interests. After co-founding the country\u2019s largest Malay-owned bank, <italic>Bank Bumiputra </italic>in 1965, Kuok led Malaysia\u2019s Finance Minister\u2019s plan to organize <italic>Malaysian International Shipping Corp </italic>in 1968. <italic>Kuok</italic>\u2019s collaboration with state institutions, substantial shareholdings in various companies, and representation by Malay elites on their boards facilitated lasting partnerships for business protection and expansion.\nAs Chinese made up 3% of Indonesia, immigrant Liem Sioe Liong, adopted his surname to his new home following WWII and founding <italic>Salim</italic>. <italic>Salim</italic> expanded and diversified into financial activities, including <italic>Bank of Central Asia</italic>, Indonesia\u2019s largest private bank formed out of the 1957 nationalization of <italic>Dutch East Indies Co </italic>successor <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>. A 1957 FX crisis forced Indonesia\u2019s first President to nationalize <italic>Shell</italic> oil into <italic>Pertamina</italic>. \nTo separate trade from production, Suharto split <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> and nationalized banks in 1963. As Marxists slaughtered Chinese merchants, General Suharto seized power and <italic>Pertamina</italic> by 1966. Suharto soon sold the country\u2019s clove, cement, and flour monopolies to <italic>Salim</italic>. While Liem held a passive stake in <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Central Asia</italic>, he controlled it with his fellow Overseas Chinese Riady family, which had controlling stakes in <italic>Lippo Bank</italic> in Jakarta and Chinese Bank in Hong Kong. \nAfter Russian engineers visited Indonesia in 1967, Japan sought to fund hydroelectricity there, but could not agree on how. European and American firms developed Libyan oil after the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> <italic>Crisis</italic> and <italic>Sinai War </italic>of 1956 and in Nigeria after Libyan boycott during the <italic>Six Day War</italic> of 1967. Since Hong Kong refused to reduce withholding taxes, <italic>Bank of America, Chase,</italic> and <italic>Narodny</italic> ran to Singapore when she lowered taxes in 1968 and the Muslim Religious Council absorbed waqf (charitable Islamic trusts) decision-making powers. Together with Hong Kong, Singapore invested in MMEA to bank East Asia. \nIn Taiwan, Chiang Kai-Shek\u2019s autocracy grew in the 1960s. As more people were arrested for advocating Taiwan\u2019s independence, legal scholar Peng Ming-min was detained in 1964. After the death of his chief rival in 1965, Chiang Ching-kuo, Kai-Shek\u2019s only son (from his first wife, not Soong), became national defense minister. As he directed industrial and economic development, Ching-kuo became the Vice-Premier from 1969. After surviving an assassination attempt in America in 1970, Chiang Ching-kuo became Taiwan\u2019s premier and implemented a crackdown on corruption within the bureaucracy from 1972. While Kai-Shek continued as President, Yu Kuo-hwa, who hailed from the same village as the Chiangs, governed <italic>Bank of Taiwan</italic>.\nSoon after banishing Japanese occupiers, America granted the Philippines independence in 1946. By 1954, CIA\u2019s Lansdale and Taiwanese traders formed<italic> Federation of Chinese Chambers of Commerce</italic>. When Ferdinand Marcos sought promotional campaign funds in the early 1960s, <italic>Federation</italic>\u2019s Chua Haw-ko refused, saying they only supported incumbents. So, Marcos enlisted the support of <italic>Chinese Tobacco Association</italic> President Ralph Nubla. Nubla redirected their contributions from <italic>Federation </italic>to Marcos and convinced <italic>Chinese Textile Association</italic> to do the same. As President Ferdinand reduced <italic>Tobacco Association</italic> import duties and allowed <italic>Textile Association </italic>to<italic> </italic>import Japanese textiles despite tariff restrictions. <italic>Federation </italic>subsequently replaced Chua with Nubla. Nubla also became the head of <italic>Philippine Bank of Communications</italic>, a branch of Taiwan\u2019s <italic>Bank of Communications</italic>.\nFollowing the <italic>Spanish-American War</italic> in 1898, the American Philippines denied citizenship and economic assimilation to new Chinese immigrants. Despite further Chinese restrictions after WWII, most private commercial banks were Chinese-Filipino, Basque, or foreign. By 1970, the five banks owning nearly half of all bank assets, were: government\u2019s <italic>Philippine National Bank</italic>, American <italic>Citi</italic>, Chinese-Filipino<italic> China Banking Corp</italic>, <italic>Equitable Bank</italic>, <italic>Bank of the Philippines</italic>, and Lopez\u2019s <italic>Philippine Commercial & Industrial Bank</italic>. Since a Basque governor established the Philippines\u2019 first bank in 1851 it became <italic>Bank of the Philippines</italic> in 1912, and <italic>Ayala</italic> took it over from the Catholic Archdiocese in 1969. While the Ayala family\u2019s intermarriages diluted their Basque heritage, Aboitiz continued marrying within the community. As <italic>Aboitiz</italic> management shifted to an American-educated generation in 1968, they expanded into banking, energy, and real estate from shipping.\nDespite independence, America controlled Philippine electricity. Since Hopson\u2019s <italic>Associated</italic> PUIHC and PA1935, <italic>Manilla Electric</italic> (\u201c<italic>Meralco</italic>\u201d) services collapsed during Japanese occupation in WWII. But by 1947, electricity capacity exceeded prewar levels, and <italic>Meralco</italic> soon restored service to metro Manila. In 1962, sugar and media magnate Eugenio Lopez established <italic>Meralco</italic> <italic>Securities</italic> to acquire <italic>Meralco</italic>. \nAfter Marxist-sympathizing President Diosdado Macapagal investigated his use of kinship politics for securing bank loans for takeovers, Lopez supported Ferdinand Marcos in his presidential bid in 1965. With Marcos\u2019 support, <italic>Meralco</italic> built an oil pipe from Batangas to Manila in 1967 and founded <italic>Philippine Electric</italic> to produce transformers and other equipment in 1969. Other expansion moves brought the company into banking and oil refinery operations.\nAfter naming Fernando Lopez his VP, Marcos faced resistance over fuel price increases, strikes, and violent government responses. As the Lopez family used their media empire to protest his government, Marcos declared martial law in 1972, during which the Lopez family lost control of their assets. While replacing newspapers with ties to the Marcos regime, Marcos interests gained control of <italic>Meralco </italic>and the country\u2019s second largest bank, <italic>Philippine Commercial & Industrial Bank</italic>. \nBy 1973, <italic>Jardine</italic> expanded into Philippine sugar plantations, soon partnering with <italic>Aboitiz</italic> to create the country\u2019s largest insurance broker, <italic>Jardine Aboitiz Insurance Brokers</italic>. Commencing in 1975, Philippine President Marcos initiated an inclusive naturalization policy, leading to citizenship for many in the Chinese community. After natural disasters damaged <italic>Meralco,</italic> Marcos absorbed <italic>Meralco</italic> and designated the state monopoly as the sole electrical power producer in 1979. Still, electricity distribution expanded in the Manila region, connecting numerous towns and cities to meet growing power demand by the mid-1980s. \nMorover, Marcos\u2019 associates soon acquired over a dozen Philippine banks. In 1977, Herminio Disini reopened <italic>Continental Bank</italic> as <italic>International Corporate Bank</italic>. Ricardo Silverio\u2019s <italic>Pilipinas Bank</italic> received state support after a 1976 merger. Marcos\u2019 nephew Eduardo Cojuangco Jr bought <italic>First</italic> <italic>United Bank</italic> in 1981 (renamed <italic>United Coconut Planters Bank</italic>). Lucio Tan\u2019s group (renamed <italic>Genbank</italic> <italic>Allied Bank</italic> in 1981. Disini\u2019s group purchased <italic>Overseas Bank of Manila</italic> in 1984 (renamed <italic>Commercial Bank of Manila</italic>). \nRalph Nubla acquired <italic>Philippine Bank of</italic> <italic>Communications</italic> in 1982. Marcos\u2019 brother-in-law Benjamin Romualdez took over <italic>Philippine Commercial & Industrial Bank</italic> in 1981. Imelda Marcos\u2019 family friend Emilio Yap acquired <italic>Philippine Trust</italic> <italic>Co</italic> in 1983. Marcos held most shares of <italic>Philippine Veterans Bank</italic> in trust. Marcos associate Roberto Benedicto acquired <italic>Republic Bank</italic> in 1978, (renamed <italic>Republic Planters Bank</italic>), and bought <italic>Traders Commercial Bank</italic> (renamed <italic>Traders Royal Bank</italic>). Marcos reportedly controlled <italic>Security Bank</italic> through front companies.\nEntering the Pacific, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> employed a consistent approach of forming partnerships with prominent local banks and influential families. In 1960, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> established her first JV with <italic>Wagg</italic> in Australia. John Darling, from a prominent Australian business family, became the local partner, along with other local participants like <italic>Bank of New South Wales</italic>, <italic>Binder Hamlyn</italic>, and <italic>Jardine</italic>. With <italic>Wagg</italic> and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> investment <italic>Darling</italic> opened an office in Sydney. While <italic>Wagg</italic> and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> merged by 1962, and venture expanded to Melbourne and Perth.\nSince Britain\u2019s Africa-focused <italic>Standard</italic> acquired <italic>Bank of British West Africa</italic> in 1965, HSBC\u2019s great rival East Asia-focused <italic>Chartered </italic>broke her Africa-sharing contract with <italic>Chase, </italic>merging with <italic>Standard</italic> in 1969, and gold broker <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic> from <italic>Hambro</italic> in May 1973. Impressed by <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic>\u2019s advisory on the<italic> Chartered</italic> merger,<italic> Standard</italic> <italic>Chartered</italic> invited <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> to form a merchant banking JV in Hong Kong, <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> <italic>Chartered</italic> by 1970. With <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> and <italic>Chartered</italic> holding 40% each, and <italic>China Light</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s<italic> </italic>Lawrence Kadoorie held the remaining 20% and became the non-executive Chair. The business took off, especially due to a new issues boom, and <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> <italic>Chartered</italic> expanded to Singapore and Tokyo, tapping into the thriving Chinese textile and garment industry. As <italic>Hong Kong Stock Exchange</italic> boomed, <italic>Hutchison</italic>\u2019s Chair Douglas Cleague introduced the first investment trust, <italic>GT Management</italic>. Following <italic>Hang Seng Bank</italic>\u2019s IPO, <italic>Sung Tao Newspapers</italic> hired intention to go public with the assistance of <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> <italic>Chartered.</italic> \nWinfried Bischoff led <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> <italic>Chartered</italic>\u2019s new issues, averaging one every six weeks. Born in Germany in 1941, Bischoff\u2019s Christian family later relocated to South Africa due to his father\u2019s work in import-export. With a degree in economics from <italic>Uni of Witwatersrand,</italic> Bischoff parlayed a relationship with <italic>Chase</italic> Frankfurt\u2019s Hermann Volz into a coveted trainee program with <italic>Chase</italic> New York. After joining <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg </italic>without an <italic>Eton</italic> or <italic>Oxford</italic> education, he built <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> <italic>Chartered</italic> by networking with fellow entrepreneurs, and leading the IPO of <italic>Cheung Kong</italic> IHC by 1972. \n<italic>Cheung Kong</italic>\u2019s founder Li Ka-shing descended from a scholarly family in Chaozhou, Guangdong, where his great-grandfather was a distinguished scholar in the Qing Dynasty\u2019s civil service exams. After his scholar father died, Li apprenticed at his wealthy uncle\u2019s pioneering watch manufacturer in Hong Kong. His uncle\u2019s wealth helped bankroll Li's early plastic flower manufacturing ventures, and in 1963, Li married his cousin. He soon became one of Hong Kong\u2019s main property developers and industrialized the port. \nAs America, Britain, and the Dutch de-industrialized from coal manufacturing to financial services, Japan, Germany, and Italy rebuilt with re-industrialization. Like Poland for East Europe, Germany supplied ECSC coal. De-industrialization replaced coal mining with low-cost overseas oil and coal imports from the 1960s. So, bankers consolidated domestically. Alfred Herrhausen started his career at <italic>Ruhrgas</italic> in Essen after graduating from college in 1952. In 1955, he moved to a regional public PU, which he helped partially privatize in 1966, and later joined as a board executive. \nBy 1970, Herrhausen joined <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>\u2019s board with responsibility for the Essen region as well as operations in North and South America, Australasia, and South Africa. Likewise, J\u00fcrgen Ponto led <italic>Dresdner Bank</italic> from 1969, soon reorganizing RWE and AEG.  While GBB\u2019s first President Karl Blessing steered Germany through the P<italic>anic of 1966</italic>, he retired soon after. By 1981, Blessing\u2019s son joined <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>\u2019s board. However, West Germany\u2019s left-wing <italic>Red Army Faction</italic> militants began murdering senior industrialists and robbing banks from the late 1960s.\nBy 1967, AEC began to sell enriched uranium on the global market. As poor electricity spurred Czech coal strikes in 1968, <italic>Lloyd</italic> South America, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, and <italic>Lazard</italic> London funded Hungarian projects via MMEU. SCP shifted from oil, gas, and coal to Czech-built nuclear power out of Ukraine with Uzbek uranium. By 1971, <italic>Rothschild</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> out of France formed a uranium cartel to stabilize global uranium prices. Still, bankruptcies continued. While AEC sunset the uranium embargo from 1972 over five years, she PUs to long term contracts, and TVA and FTC were aware of the cartel. Having dominated ECGD export credit, <italic>Lazard</italic> London faced competition by 1972.\nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>, Poland allowed food inflation to quell shortages but deflated nonfood. Dock strikes led her to Western banks to industrialize. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia\u2019s long-time Communist dictator Josip Broz Tito reduced state control over the economy and moved towards \u2018market socialism\u2019 with increased managerial autonomy. By 1971, constitutional amendments aimed to enhance self-management within republics and enterprises, establishing agreements to coordinate. That year, Yugoslavia became the first centrally planned economy to break the monobank and introduce a market-oriented two-tier banking system. Concurrently, Yugoslav banks expanded overseas, aiding exporters with trade financing for major Western financial centers, emphasizing support for exporters and assisting Yugoslav firms in Germany and America.\nAfter BSU<italic> </italic>opened a second Moscow bank to settle Eastern European MMEU debts, <italic>Narodny </italic>opened sister banks in Frankfurt (1971) and Vienna (1974). By 1974, Viktor Gerashchenko chaired <italic>Narodny </italic>Frankfurt. As the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>, MMEU transitioned from corporate to sovereign debt after the <italic>Herstatt </italic>failed in Frankfurt. By 1975, <italic>Narodny</italic> Singapore retreated MMEA as her loans funded illicit Chinese activities. The same year, <italic>Pertamina</italic>, Indonesia\u2019s state oil company, defaulted on its foreign debts and the central bank of the country hired <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris, London\u2019s <italic>Warburg</italic> <italic>Paribas</italic>, and New York\u2019s <italic>Lehman Kuhn</italic> to sort out its affairs. These firms formed an association nicknamed \u2018<italic>Troika</italic>\u2019 and offered their services to other countries. They offered expertise to local governments in exchange for a fixed salary and assisted them in international negotiations, playing on their credibility and respectability in front of the <italic>Paris Club</italic>. \nThe <italic>Troika</italic> and <italic>Paris Club</italic> were closely connected. One member of the <italic>Paris Club</italic> was Denis Samuel-Lajeunesse. The son of <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris Director Ren\u00e9 Samuel-Lajeunesse, Denis joined the Treasury Directorate of the Ministry of Finance. He served as Assistant to the heads of the treasury departments from 1973 to 1975 and as Alternate Administrator at IMF from 1977 to 1979. In the 1980s, he was Deputy Director of Multilateral Affairs (1983-1985), Deputy Director of Savings & Financial Markets (1985), Deputy Director of Holdings (1985-1986), and Head of the International Affairs Service (1986-1992).\nBut the <italic>Troika</italic> faced competition. <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> recruited <italic>Foreign Office</italic> and <italic>BANK</italic> staff to advise central banks and state enterprises. But bankers also competed with consultants. While refusing to restructure <italic>Bank of China </italic>due to a perceived lack of impact, <italic>McKinsey</italic> accepted President Nyerere\u2019 invitation to study decentralization of Tanzania\u2019s government. Amid the competition, Gerashchenko had to rehabilitate <italic>Narodny</italic> Singapore by 1977.\nAs PUs ran from oil to nuclear after the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>, uranium prices spiked. Although the European cartel dissolved, <italic>Westinghouse</italic> reneged on a bundle contract in 1975, further increasing uranium prices. Breaking the American nuclear reactor monopoly, SCP entered the uranium market in 1974 competing with GE and <italic>Westinghouse</italic> by selling PUs to Spain, South Korea, and Argentina. While America and Japan considered funding Soviet oil, they shifted in 1975. Japan funded Indonesian hydroelectricity for oil, contracted long-term Middle East oil and Australia coal, and drilled for oil in Korea and China. \nIn 1972, BMW Germany informed EC of its exclusive distribution agreements. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1973</italic>, EC granted BMW an individual exemption for its distribution scheme in 1974. The agreement prohibited exports to other member states, but EC required BMW to remove a clause that restricted consumers from choosing their own garage for repairs and to allow the sale of original parts to independent dealers. However, German importers complained that BMW Belgium was banning intra-<italic>European Economic Community</italic> (\u201cEEC\u201d) exports without notifying EEC, while German BMW dealers bought directly from Belgian dealers at lower prices. \nAmidst oil inflation and the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Jean Guyot helped <italic>Michelin</italic> sell her stake in bankrupt <italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> to <italic>Peugeot </italic>to better compete. In 1976, <italic>MedicoBanca</italic>\u2019s Cuccia organized the sale of 9% sale of Italy\u2019s largest manufacturer, <italic>Fiat</italic>, to Libya. By 1978, <italic>British Leyland</italic> received massive public financial support and eventually became fully nationalized by the government. While French <italic>Peugeot Citro\u00ebn</italic> bought American <italic>Chrysler</italic>\u2019s struggling European operations, she could not turn it around. In July 1979, EEC\u2019s Court invalidated Belgian BMW\u2019s distribution agreement, destabilizing her distribution. So, EC drafted an exemption for the sector to preserve independent sales networks and ensure price competition between member states.\nLike leasing boomed in capitalist countries, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> formed joint ventures in oil-rich Iran, UAE, Oman, and\u2014with <italic>Narodny</italic>\u2014Lebanon, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Romania. For export finance, American and British ECGD guarantees, Congress and Europe limited sovereign immunity by 1976. However, following the suicide of an imprisoned leader in 1976, the <italic>Red Army Faction</italic> continued to commit a series of violent acts in West Germany in 1977. \nThese terrorist activities opposing capitalist imperialism included the bombing American military bases and murder of prominent industrialists and bankers, like when <italic>Dresdner</italic>\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Ponto was shot. Still, France expanded ECGD, and Congress did so in 1979. As Norwegian, Dutch, and British SOEs developed North Sea offshore oil and gas, France had only a small allocation and so firms pooled resources to finance research. As France built nuclear PUs, her ECGD credits spurred<italic> Lazard</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and <italic>Shell</italic> accelerated imports of oil, coal, and uranium from the Persian Gulf and Africa.\nSince the de-legalization of hongs in the 19th century, four British trading company conglomerates soon dominated Hong Kong trade\u2014half by Brits and the other half by Chinese\u2014namely <italic>Jardine</italic>, <italic>Hutchison Whampoa</italic>, <italic>Swire Pacific</italic>, and <italic>Wharf Holdings</italic>. After the <italic>Panic of 1973</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg Chartered</italic>\u2019s Bischoff encountered financial troubles, leading to his premature sale of shares. As business activity ceased aside from <italic>China Light</italic> rights issues, <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> and <italic>Chartered</italic> recorded their only loss in 1974. \nThat year, Li Ka-shing set up a deposit-taking JV with <italic>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</italic>. After HSBC rescued and merging her 19th century trading and docks companies into <italic>Hutchison </italic><italic> Whampoa</italic> in 1977, Bischoff advised <italic>Cheung Kong</italic>\u2019s Li Ka-shing in gaining control of <italic>Hutchison </italic><italic> Whampoa</italic> in 1979 with HSBC loans, becoming the first Asian to lead a major British trading house. While Li joined HSBC\u2019s board several months later and became the bank\u2019s Chinese leader, HSBC\u2019s dominance over Hong Kong shipping began diminishing. \nSo, HSBC began competing in the real estate market that she had formerly left to Chinese bankers. Moreover, as China liberalized and formed <italic>China International Trust & Investment Corp </italic>(\u201cCITIC\u201d) for domestic and foreign investments, Li became a director. Similarly, Bischoff defended <italic>Hong Kong Gas</italic> from <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s HEC bank holiday weekend takeover bid. Without a prior relationship, Bischoff aided RC Lee in Hong Kong\u2019s first London-style market defense, ultimately winning by a significant margin against multiple bid increases.\nAlso in 1974, <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic>\u2019s Chair Michael Verey appointed James Wolfensohn as Group Chief Executive, an Australian whose father served as a private secretary to James Rothschild until falling out with him. Wolfensohn focused on expanding investment banking operations, including <italic>Schr\u00f6der </italic>New York, which was led by Steve Petschek, a <italic>Petschek</italic> heir and Czech refugee who worked at <italic>Cravath</italic> and <italic>Loeb</italic>. As David Ogilvy replaced Verey in 1977, Wolfensohn resigned to join <italic>Salomon</italic> and then headed <italic>BANK</italic>. However, Petschek\u2019s business career ended after being shot in the face.\nBy 1976, <italic>China Light</italic> and its partner <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s <italic>Esso Eastern</italic> sought to construct new power stations, with British ECGD guarantee financing. Bischoff informed <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic>\u2019s Dewe Mathews in London, who proposed that <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> arrange the power station financing, unaware that GEC had appointed <italic>Lazard</italic> London for the task. This sparked a prolonged battle over who would secure the financing for <italic>China Light</italic>\u2019s power stations. As <italic>Lazard</italic> London partnered with HSBC to finance the entire contract in Hong Kong <italic>dollars</italic> at a higher fixed rate with a margin, <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic>\u2019s tied to American <italic>dollars</italic>. While Financial Secretary Philip Haddon-Cave intervened, deeming <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s margin offer as unreasonable, <italic>Esso</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s preference for American <italic>dollar</italic> loans led her to offer to syndicate the loans among American banks, helping <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> secure the mandate.\nOver the following decade, such electric financings broke more records and soon included France. Within these arrangements, female executives thrived. As <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> Assistant Director Sasha Chamberlain led day-to-day operations, Sheila Chuang served as <italic>Exxon</italic>\u2019s Finance Director. From <italic>Exxon</italic>,<italic> Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> hired PhD economist Kathie Painter as Director to build Project Finance mathematical models. She collaborated with Alison Carnwath, the Corporate Finance Director. Maria Leung handled treasury matters for <italic>China Light</italic>, Veronique Coutarde managed <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>\u2019s participation, and Marie-Christine Moulin oversaw GEC\u2019s export operations. Nancy Cowie and Fran\u00e7oise Orsini represented the British and French ECGD organizations.\nDescended from pre-Mao Shanghai bankers, Yue-Kong Pao came to Hong Kong in 1949. After the close of the <italic>Suez Canal</italic>, he built shipping operations, selling a large stakes to HSBC in 1964\u2014whose board he joined\u2014and later <italic>Industrial Bank of Japan</italic>. By 1975, Pao\u2019s daughter wed the heir of Singapore\u2019s <italic>Wing Tai Holdings</italic>. During the battle for control of <italic>Kowloon Wharf</italic> in June 1980, HSBC supported Pao over <italic>Jardine</italic>. While both of Hong Kong\u2019s PUs had raised rates in 1974, <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s HEC adopted public control before a big hike in 1979. \nAgainst takeovers, <italic>Jardine</italic> fused HEC into a property HC in 1980, but wrote-down real estate and FX losses from 1983. As <italic>Jardine</italic> spun off subsidiaries, Li Ka-shing\u2019s <italic>Hutchison </italic><italic> Whampoa </italic>bought HEC in 1985. Since building <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> <italic>Chartered</italic> in Hong Kong and taking <italic>Cheung Kong</italic> public in 1972, Winfried Bischoff became CEO of <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> in 1984 at age 42. Likewise, <italic>Merrill </italic>bought a Hong Kong bank by 1982.\nAs PUs in Japan, Hong Kong, and Korea turned to coal, Japan industrialized Korea. As Korea altered her laws, <italic>Lazard</italic> created her first merchant bank with local banks. By 1980, Korea ended PU subsidizes for IMF and <italic>BANK</italic> aid. While America advocated Taiwan, After the passing of Chiang Kai-shek, his son Ching-kuo assumed the presidency of Taiwan in 1978, serving until his demise in 1988. A year before, Taiwan lifted martial law and privatized firms. And from 1978, Hong Kong offered an entry point into China as BCCI bought <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Hong Kong branch to bank CCP.\nBy 1980, UST bailed out <italic>Chrysler</italic>. As the oil shock curtailed car demand, European manufacturers faced supply competition from Japan, which captured 20-30% of the market. So, they restructured to compete with American and Japanese competitors. While <italic>Renault</italic> invested in <italic>Volvo</italic>, European firms also partnered with Japanese competitors as IRI-owned <italic>Alfa Romeo</italic> entered a joint-venture with <italic>Nissan</italic> in 1980. At <italic>MedioBanca</italic>\u2019s urging that year, <italic>Fiat</italic> laid off 23 thousand employees, revitalizing the enterprise. As steel deflated firms in American conglomerated, Japan cartelized, and France and Britain stopped subsidizing striking steel labor.\nIn 1982, EC attributed Europe\u2019s fragmentated car sector to member states\u2019 chaotic value-added taxes. However, consumer advocates blamed manufacturers for treating each country as a separate market, urging EC to regulate distribution and grant exemptions to harmonize prices. In 1983, EC introduced draft laws that allowed clauses prohibiting sales of new cars or parts to unauthorized dealers. They specified that the exemption would be revoked if the retail price in the highest-priced country remained above 12% of the least expensive country for over six months. By 1985, EC established a 10-year block exemption for the entire automobile industry, not just BMW. This move curtailed market competition between carmakers and dealers, ensuring competitiveness and protecting consumer access. As <italic>Fiat</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> merger with <italic>Ford Motor</italic> fell apart in 1986, Herrhausen bought Libya\u2019s <italic>Fiat</italic> stake, making <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> the second largest shareholder. <italic>Fiat</italic> soon bought <italic>Alfa Romeo</italic> and <italic>Maserati</italic>.\nSince Yugoslavia\u2019s banking reforms of 1970s, enterprise directors and technical experts soon began dominating decision-making, influenced by local politics. The most prominent of these was Slobodan Milosevic. After most of his family died, he befriended fellow law student Ivan Stambolic, nephew of a Serbian political leader. Transitioning from Belgrade city hall to produce gases for industry at <italic>Tehnogas</italic> under Stambolic, succeeding him as president in the early 1970s. However, Milosevic left in 1978 to preside over <italic>Udruzena Beogradska Banka</italic>, a conglomerate of nineteen banks, and signed a JV with <italic>Barclay</italic>. While Milosevic had little interest in politics, the death of Tito in 1980 without suitable replacements created an opportunity. \nAlthough Russia subsidized her satellites, she rationed oil after from<italic> </italic>1979. As CCC ECGD exported American grain to Egypt, Brazil, and China, banks lent over CCC\u2019s limit, MMFR rates remained above 10% through 1982 after peaking above 19% in 1980. As FRS restricted credit and threatened banks that did not constrain loans for speculation and takeovers, they promoted consumer and business credit. Extending <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s focus on ECGD, Hugo Kindersley replaced Evelyn Baring, former Governor of Kenya, as head of Britain\u2019s international development arm, <italic>Commonwealth Development Corp</italic>, in 1980. While Daniel Meinertzhagen retired as Chair of <italic>Lazard</italic> London by then, his brother Peter remained General Manager of <italic>Commonwealth Development Corp</italic>.\nWhen the <italic>Paris Club</italic> expected further write-downs, they avoided negative precedents by moving from the French treasury and allowing international OECD to reorg debt for Turkey (1980), Poland (1981), Mexico, and Cuba (1983). As Germany increased ECGD credit to Poland in 1980, America\u2019s <italic>Security Council</italic> urged UST to maintain Polish loans. When Poland raised food prices, coaler strikes inflated European electricity before she defaulted in 1981. \nAfter Poland crossed Regan\u2019s line with martial law, America prohibited oil and gas sales to the Soviet Union. Although Poland lifted martial law in 1983, the main democratic political organization remained illegal. Barter replaced hard currency for trade as energy-poor Hungary avoided default only with BIS and IMF assistance. Without federal aid, American banks reorged Polish debt. As low-cost imports replaced European coal, Germany sponsored a gas pipe to Soviet Russian over Reagan\u2019s protest.\nAs investors ran from Communist economies, Hungary and Yugoslavia could not access MMEU for FX or debt rescheduling in 1982. Banks, represented by <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic>, hesitated to engage with Comecon countries, reflecting a widespread lack of confidence in the region\u2019s financial stability. This highlighted the urgent need for measures to rebuild confidence and regain access to essential financial resources for Eastern European economies. Facing a liquidity crisis, Yugoslavia reintroduced of trade restrictions, leading to an unsustainable \u2018export at any price\u2019 strategy, challenging the country\u2019s protectionist production structure. With Stambolic\u2019s backing, Milosevic ascended in leadership roles within the Serbian Communist Party by 1984.\nAlthough Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro called for a debtor\u2019s cartel in 1982, BCCI\u2019s Abedi called for an inter-national private-public <italic>Third World Bank</italic> in 1983. By 1985, <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Herrhausen advocated a <italic>Third World</italic> debt pardon, but American bankers resisted. Within two years, most came around to conditional debt forgiveness. In 1988, the <italic>Paris Club</italic> introduced the Toronto terms, with Mali being the first recipient. By 1992, 19 countries, including 17 in sub-Saharan Africa and 2 in Latin America, had received debt relief tied to IMF agreements. \nA total of $5.7 billion was rescheduled, with $1.5 billion in partial write-offs, $1.7 billion through extended repayment periods, and $2.5 billion at concessional rates. Countries such as the Central African Republic, Madagascar, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Tanzania, and Togo received aid twice. Mali, Mozambique, and Niger obtained multi-year agreements. \nMeanwhile, Indonesian restricted banks from having foreign branches. There, <italic>Salim</italic> grew trade with other Chinese merchants and banked Suharto with MMEA. During the 1970s, while his sons led Salim, Liem established partnerships with Suharto\u2019s family. With, Suharto\u2019s half-brother, Liem expanded offshore through <italic>First Pacific Bank</italic> in Hong Kong. As Liem formed offshore <italic>First Pacific </italic>HC via Hong Kong-based, they bought Singapore-listed <italic>United Industrial Corp</italic>. Despite the low profitability of the mature steel industry, <italic>Salim</italic> organized a steel company in Indonesia for the benefit of Suharto by 1983. \nIn Thailand, amidst populist calls for social responsibility, Chen Sophonpanich\u2019s <italic>Bangkok Bank</italic> suggested that banks could adjust lending policies if the state restricted the unorganized money market and encouraged them to become public companies. In 1979, revisions to financial regulations aimed to increase state control over monetary policy, limit commercial bank investments, and promote wider ownership distribution, acknowledging the ongoing modernization of the banking system and the significance of commercial banks in Thailand\u2019s development.\nSince the 1960s, the Royal, Sophonpanich, Lamsams, Ratanarak, and several other families, gained near-monopoly control over Thai finance and industry by 1983. <italic>Bangkok Bank</italic> saw her share of total deposits rise from 18% in 1962 to almost 35% in 1983, not counting Hong Kong banks or other industries. As <italic>Bangkok Bank</italic> financed over a third of Thailand\u2019s trade. By 1993, five years after the passing of its former Chair Chen Sophonpanich, <italic>Bangkok Bank </italic>was among the world\u2019s most profitable banks.\nLike in Asia, American racism slowed Chinese finance. Chow Chan, born in April 1910, emigrated to California in 1933. In 1938, he co-founded <italic>Phoenix Bakery</italic> with his wife in Los Angeles. Unable to obtain bank loans, Chan organized several investors, including the grandfather of former Los Angeles city councilman and mayoral candidate Michael Woo. Despite resistance from state regulators, they formed <italic>Cathay Bank</italic> in 1962, which became Southern California\u2019s first (and for a decade only) Asian-American commercial bank. \nAs the <italic>Immigration Act of 1965</italic> fueled increased immigration, leading to the emergence of new ethnic communities. After being denied a state S&L charter in 1966 due to racism, Chan\u2019s co-founder Betty Chu appealed directly to FHLBB Chair Preston Martin, whom she knew from college, for a federal charter. By 1973, they founded <italic>East-West </italic>S&L, the Asian community\u2019s first S&L.\nMeanwhile, another Chinese immigrant Henry Hwang began in the laundry business and became a certified public accountant before starting one of Southern California\u2019s first Chinese immigrant-owned accounting firms. By 1974, Hwang established America\u2019s first Asian-American-owned federally chartered bank, <italic>Far East</italic> NB in Los Angeles\u2019 Chinatown. By then, Chow Chan\u2019s son, Kellogg Chan serving in the Army in South Korea and earned a business degree from <italic>UC Berkeley</italic> and a law degree from <italic>Hastings College</italic>. \nSevering as a prosecutor in the Los Angeles County district attorney\u2019s office during the mid-1960s, Kellogg ascended to assistant director of the major frauds division. By 1979, at his father\u2019s urging, Kellogg left the district attorney\u2019s office to fully dedicate himself to banking. Chan became a key figure in steering <italic>East-West </italic>S&L\u2019s as funds from Hong Kong and Taiwanese immigrants rushed into California. In 1981, Betty Chu left <italic>East-West</italic> to found <italic>Trust Savings Bank</italic>.\nSince Khoo Puat and other OCBC executives founded <italic>Malayan Banking</italic> in 1960, the bank was placed under government protection amidst anti-Chinese riots in 1969. After the Chinese ruling party established <italic>Multi-Purpose Holdings </italic>to raise investment funds from the Chinese community at large to modernize and enlarge the scale of its corporations with less emphasis on banks in 1975, the Malay government formed <italic>Permodalan Nasional</italic>, to grow Malay ownership in 1978. \nBy 1982, Malay capital ownership in Chinese-run banks grew to 77%, the share of Chinese run banks collapsed. Leading Malaysia since 1981, PM Mahathir Mohamad and his in-laws connected government, military, and finance. While one brother-in-law was Chief of the Defense Forces. Furthermore, another brother-in-law was a former central banker and Chair of <italic>Permodalan Nasional</italic>. When the largest Malay-founded banks, <italic>Bank Bumiputra</italic>, became insolvent in 1984, <italic>Permodalan Nasional </italic>transferred ownership to the oil monopoly, <italic>Petronas</italic>, in which it became the primary shareholder.\nAfter Indonesians rioted against Chinese merchants in 1984, Suharto soon proposed they turn over equity to SOEs. So, <italic>Salim</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Liem diversified. <italic>First Pacific</italic> soon bought <italic>Hibernia Bank</italic>\u2014California\u2019s 12th largest bank\u2014and Dutch trading giant <italic>Hagemeyer</italic> by 1984. Liem also co-invested in hotels and commodities jointly with fellow Oversea Chinese Malaysia\u2019s Robert Kuok. Forming political compromises and meeting government requirements by involving Malay interests in their companies, <italic>Shangri-La Hotel</italic>-owner Kuok continued to maintain political and multi-ethnic connections. \nOne of these was the Malay Rashid Hussain. Hussain began his financial career in 1971 at <italic>Strauss Turnbull</italic> in Britain. He returned to Malaysia in 1975 to join <italic>Bank Bumiputra</italic> and gained international experience with <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Daiwa</italic> in Tokyo, and <italic>Salomon</italic> in New York. By 1983, he founded Malaysia\u2019s largest stock brokerage in 1982. Before Kuok partnered with Hussain, he bought <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s Malaysian affiliate with Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin. \nHowever, a recession destabilized <italic>Multi-Purpose Holdings</italic>. In response, Kuok joined a group to revitalize the group in 1987 with liquidations before returning to their own businesses. Instead, Lim Thian Kiat became Chair of <italic>Multi-Purpose Holdings</italic> after his father\u2019s bank took over the highway toll concession in 1987 alongside Hussain and Zainuddin\u2019s family. As Hussain married Kuok\u2019s daughter in 1989, he joined Salim to take over another Malaysian bank in 1990. \nAgainst<italic> Lloyd</italic> Bank\u2019s takeover bid in 1986, <italic>Standard Chartered</italic> sold a third of her stock. Pao bought half as Australia\u2019s Robert Holmes and Singapore\u2019s Khoo Puat split the rest. Also that year, American regulators assisted <italic>Hibernia</italic> in buying troubled <italic>United Savings Bank</italic>, in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown. Similarly, <italic>Hibernia</italic> bought seven North California branches as the condition for FRS to allow <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> to buy <italic>Crocker NB</italic>. Reversing their American bank investments in 1987, <italic>First Pacific</italic> decided to sell <italic>Hibernia Bank</italic>, pivoting to Asian investments to avoid regulatory challenges.\nSince Philippines President Marcos nationalized <italic>Meralco</italic>, foreign creditors stopped lending to the loss-leader, and most of her shares were pledged to government banks as collateral on bad loans. Around the revolution of 1986 that ousted Marcos, <italic>Meralco</italic> losses hit a high of 23%. Since Marcos initiated an inclusive naturalization policy for the Chinese community in 1975, Chinese-Filipinos owned 45% of large manufacturers by 1986 and acquired privatized enterprises soon after. The revolution also restored Lopez family\u2019s holdings, including <italic>Meralco</italic>. As Manuel Lopez became President of <italic>Meralco</italic>, <italic>Meralco</italic> initiated efforts to upgrade its network, which had suffered during the Marcos era and continued to face challenges in the economic turbulence of the late 1980s.\nBy 1984, China\u2019s CCP relaxed restrictions on private entrepreneurship while SOE reforms lagged. To address the growing disparity between the private and public sectors, a new decision on reform of the economic structure was promulgated, calling to reduce central planning for SOEs, a profit tax, and greater enterprise autonomy. Despite resistance from SOE workers and staff, urban residents feared inflation and rushed to withdraw money from banks and buy commodities. \nAside from small traders, many entrepreneurs descended from pre-revolutionary elites, using their connections to secure credit and launch business. China also appointed one of the first female central bank chairs, Chen Muhua in 1985. The other early female chairs were also from Marxist countries. While the first were at <italic>East German National Bank </italic>between the 1950s and 1970s, Tamara Pefia briefly led <italic>Banco Central de Bolivia</italic> in 1985, and Pany Yathotou presided over <italic>Bank of Laos</italic> for almost a decade from 1988.\nMeanwhile, China\u2019s capitalist trade partner faced a crisis. By early 1985, Taiwan faced its worst financial scandal. Bank runs hit <italic>Taipei Tenth Credit Cooperative</italic> and <italic>Cathay Investment & Trust Co</italic>, both controlled by KMT member Tasi Chen-chou. The scandal exposed financial irregularities, government corruption, and systemic weaknesses. Government officials, including Economic Minister Hsu Lih-teh and Finance Minister Loh Jen-kang, resigned. Premier Yu Kuo-hua, implicated in the scandal, retained his position, while KMT Secretary-General Tsiang Yen-shih was removed from his role due to rumored involvement in the scandal. \nAs <italic>China Petroleum </italic>sold oil below import cost since the <italic>Panic of 1973</italic>, oil and coal SOE monopolies stymied private enterprise until an FX crisis in 1985. While BCCI loans eased pressure, CCP de-monopolized coal into SOEs and free collieries and streamlined SOE bankruptcy to protect employees and consolidate. While <italic>McKinsey</italic> refused to restructure <italic>Bank of China</italic> in the 1970s and overhauling China\u2019s steel industry in 1985, she set up a branch in Hong Kong that year.\nOver seven thousand Chinese enterprises sold non-transferable shares by 1989, mainly to employees. In early 1987, a nationwide campaign against \u2018bourgeois liberalization\u2019 led CCP to regulate investment in fixed asset projects. But as inflation soared, residents in northeastern China ran from banks for the first time since 1949 to department stores in June 1988. In response to this crisis, CCP established a special task force to control fixed assets investment. Over 600 construction projects\u2014many which had not started yet\u2014were cancelled or postponed, and plans were made to increase CCP economic management. So, as bank financed fell in 1989, SOE loans grew as CCP took over fixed investment. As falls for privatization grew, so did protest.\nWhile President Bush Sr appointed <italic>Akin Gump</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Strauss Ambassador to Russia, he recruited former <italic>McKinsey</italic> and <italic>Celanese</italic> head John Macomber to lead EXIM in 1989. Establishing an audit committee and loan-loss reserves, who grew export financing from $6.36 to 12.06 billion by 1991. As CCC ECGD loans to Egypt, Iraq, Korea, Morocco, and Algeria grew, Iraq deregulated food prices and dissolved unions in 1989. \nAs inflation and unemployment soared, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. While the Soviet Union joined America and the international community in the <italic>Gulf War</italic>, domestic and international oil stockpiles established following the 1973 embargo mitigated supply disruptions in America, resulting in oil prices remaining 30% above prewar levels into 1992. Without such oil reserves, India\u2019s FX reserves dwindled to less than a month\u2019s worth of imports by June 1991, leading to a sharp decline in industrial production as inflation soared. Following Hussein\u2019s retreat, Congress increased CCC loans to Iraq, which re-licensed private banks for the first time since 1964. Amidst the crisis, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Rodney Wagner arranged a syndicated loan for Saudi Arabia to cover war costs.\nSince 1982, BCCI had branches in Canada, Venezuela, Columbia, Jamaica, Panama, and America, allowing Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to launder cocaine money out of Florida. After <italic>Safra</italic> sold one of his banks to Robinson\u2019s <italic>American Express</italic> in 1983, his other banks continued competing, fueling bad blood grew. As right-wing antisemitic newspapers linked <italic>Safra</italic> to CIA, Iran, and South American cocaine in 1988, <italic>American Express</italic> apologized for slandering <italic>Safra</italic> after a private detective found implicating evidence. \nIn 1984 Turkey charged officials at her largest banks of buying black market gold with Turkish<italic> lira</italic> and selling smuggled gold for <italic>dollars</italic> and <italic>marks</italic> as capital flight. Within a year, Lebanese Armenians laundered drug money to America with <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> and BCCI. After a political scandal, the Swiss Parliament criminalized money laundering in April 1989. \nAs Abedi had a heart transplant and stepped aside from BCCI, Pakistan elected Bhutto\u2019s daughter, Benazir, as PM in 1988. (Several years later, Bangladesh elected Sheikh Hasina Wajid as PM, the daughter of the slain PM Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.) Ahead of charging the first major international bank with drug money laundering, DOJ blocked BOE\u2019s reorg and runs by closing BCCI in July 1991, spreading losses to global FX counterparties. \nAlthough Americans had few BCCI assets, FRS ringfenced BCCI\u2019s assets to pay American creditors paid in full and levied a $200 million fine against BCCI for failing to disclose its identity when investing in American banks earlier. Depositors in Britain, Japan, and the Third World. DOJ indicted Abedi\u2014who slept at FRS <italic>New York</italic> before his death in 1995\u2014and Pharaon. As <italic>Safra</italic> stemmed cocaine money rumors with an internal control audit, FA1991 extended FA1978 to give FRS powers to close international banks in America, FRS moved to give BIS dictatorial powers over international banking. \nWhile Abu Dhabi Shaikh Zayid lost billions in a failed effort to avoid collapse, Shaykh Khalid of <italic>Saudi National Commercial Bank</italic> paid $224 million to settle charges of wrongdoing. After years of fraudulent loss concealment, fines, and ring-fencing, over 500 <italic>Deloitte</italic> staff recovered 75% when the insolvency closed in 2012. Over 100 subsidiaries BCCI went bankrupt, but the Colombia branch may have been the only survivor. \nIn the 1920s, the Gilinski family fled Lithuania for Israel before settling in Colombia, where they established a conglomerate to buy and sell companies. After acquiring BCCI\u2019s Colombia branch with loans from <italic>Barclay</italic> and ING, Gilinski reorganized it into <italic>Andino</italic>. However, concerns about low share prices worried the government, and Gilinski sold <italic>Andino</italic>. Later, as Colombia privatized <italic>Banco de Colombia</italic>, Gilinski purchased the bank using funds from <italic>Soros</italic> and subsequently sold her. \nAlong with BCCI, the banking empire of fellow Gulf financed Iraqi Ahmad Chalabi collapsed. Since Chalalbi became CEO of Jordan\u2019s <italic>Petra Bank </italic>in 1981 and advised his brother Hazem at <italic>MEBCO Bank </italic>in Switzerland\u2014which served Lebanese clients in West Africa, including Lebanese Jamil Mohamed gained control of Sierra Leone\u2019s diamond fields and fisheries by supporting the government\u2014a banking scandal in 1989 forced the dismissal of Ahmad Chalabi from P<italic>etra, </italic>which<italic> </italic>collapsed along with related Swiss and Lebanese enterprises. After Chalabi fled to Britain, Jordan convicted him in absentia to 22 years in prison for fraud.\nInstead of BCCI, more Western-affiliated bankers emerged to link Islamic markets from Africa to Pakistan. Out of Turkey, Mehmet Kutman founded <italic>Global Securities</italic> in 1990, with a New York branch led by ex-<italic>Citi</italic> Donna Pulini. Expanding into Central Asia, Kutman managed an IPO for Turkey\u2019s <italic>FS Invest</italic>, obtaining a license to distribute <italic>Coca Cola</italic> in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and southern Russia. He also established JV in Pakistan with UBS, overseen by ex-<italic>Citi</italic> banker Khawaja Iqbal Hassan. <italic>Global Securities</italic> soon branched to Cairo<italic>.</italic> \nIn 1994, Aly Tahry and Aladdin Saba left <italic>Kidder</italic> to establish <italic>Hermes</italic>. Two years later, they merged with ex-<italic>Goldman</italic> banker Ahmed Heikal\u2019s <italic>Egyptian Finance Group</italic>, resulting in <italic>EFG-Hermes</italic>, Cairo\u2019s largest investment bank. <italic>EFG-Hermes</italic> expanded across the Middle East and North Africa. Four years after <italic>Goldman</italic> forged an alliance with Hindi Uday Kotak in 1994, the two formed <italic>Goldman </italic>India<italic>.</italic> \nSince <italic>Indochine</italic> and <italic>Suez</italic> fused in 1975, <italic>Indochine</italic> <italic>Suez</italic> sought to buy <italic>Grenfell</italic> in 1989. Having befriended German Chancellor Helmut Kohlm <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Herrhausen was appointed as one of three consultants to reorg German steel in 1983. While Herrhausen\u2019s consolidation plan failed as steel managers and states refused to close unprofitable locations, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>\u2019s board elected Herrhausen as spokesman in 1985. \nThat year, a mid-level KGB officer, Vladimir Putin, arrived in Dresden as East Germany neared bankruptcy. While evidence of Putin\u2019s dealings has been destroyed, the <italic>Red Army Faction</italic> killed the head of R&D at <italic>Siemens</italic> by 1986. While Herrhausen sealed a $3 billion loan to the Soviet Union in 1988, Germans tore down the <italic>Berlin Wall</italic> on November 9, 1989, and <italic>Deutsche</italic> bought <italic>Grenfell </italic>at the end of the month. Within two days, the <italic>Faction</italic> assassinated Herrhausen using a remote car bomb. As East Germany underwent political and economic changes after the fall of the Berlin Wall, certain old elites and Stasi leaders formed alliances to exploit state resources and acquire assets for personal gain. But none of this could happen in the open.\nWhile America, Chile, and Taiwan had private bankruptcy, Britain, Mexico, and most of Asia, regulated bailouts with insolvency laws. Unlike America and Chile, Britain had public electricity until 1990 despite Thatcher. As<italic> </italic>hedge funds like <italic>Soros</italic> replaced <italic>Citi</italic>-led bank cartels, Britain, Asia, and Latin America still had <italic>dollar</italic> debt. \nAlthough European central banks guaranteed <italic>mark</italic> debts after reforms disrupted loan cartels, German reunification strengthened the <italic>mark</italic>. So, <italic>Soros</italic> led currency shorts against BOE and other pegged FX banks from 1992. While antitrust led <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic>\u2014and later <italic>Gates</italic>\u2014to fund health, BCCI\u2019s controlling charities promoted \u2018<italic>South</italic>\u2019 and \u2018<italic>Third World</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>, and Soros<italic> </italic>started <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic> against what he saw as authoritarian. From Hungary in 1984, he expanded to Russia in 1987, and 20 others by 1992. \nOut of Britain, Arthur Lehman Goodhart\u2019s three Anglican sons helped steer philanthropy and policy. While eldest brother Philip became a Conservative Member of Parliament, and briefly serving under Thatcher\u2019s government, middle brother William focused on international law and human rights before joining the House of Lords. Charles, the youngest brother, pursued a career as an academic economist and started providing policy advice at BOE in 1968. His involvement in significant central bank regime changes included his role in Hong Kong during the <italic>Panic of 1983</italic> and his contributions to establishing inflation targeting in New Zealand in 1988. Goodhart firmly believed in the concept of an autonomous central bank and, as a testament to his expertise, he was appointed as an external member of BOE\u2019s inaugural <italic>Monetary Policy Committee</italic> from 1997.\nIn 1989, Eastern Europe witnessed protests signaling the end of Communism. Amidst this, there arose a desire among Serbs for a unified Serbian republic of Yugoslavia disintegrated. By 1990, Slobodan Milosevic advocated for a Greater Serbia over independent republics. In 1991, Slovenia declared independence, triggering conflicts in the region. Ethnic cleansing began in Croatia, escalating tensions, and Bosnia faced the dilemma of staying in Yugoslavia or declaring independence, risking war. \nIn May, Congress prohibited economic assistance to Yugoslavia due to human rights violations in Kosovo. America took the lead in recognizing Bosnia in April 1992, while Saudi Arabia, supported the Bosnian Muslims. Mid-1992 saw Slobodan Milosevic facing potential ousting due to economic hardships and global condemnation for war-related repercussions. By 1993, President Clinton\u2019s Secretary of State Madeleine Albright viewed Milosevic as evil. Her parents had fled Czechoslovakia and converted to Christianity in the 1930s. Likening the situation to Hitler\u2019s actions in 1938 and Stalin\u2019s moves in 1948, she advocated for a bombing campaign to pressure Serbs into ending the Bosnian war by 1995.\nLikewise, without Soviet oversight, nuclear weaponization grew. While coal-based industries grew in South Korea, under-developed coal deflated North Korea, which began mining uranium for weaponization. So, America embargoed her oil. \n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panic of 1997</italic><italic> </italic>\nWhen Boston Brahmin-led <italic>Boston Co</italic> and <italic>Boston Safe Deposit & Trust </italic>controlled BCG, rising star Bill Bain left in 1973 to start his management consulting firm because he believed management consultants should implement strategy. Within a year, BCG became independent. Among the first to form an ESOP for a management LBO after the Congress enacted ERISA during the <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>. In 1977, Bain recruited Mitt Romney, a Mormon who had consulted with BCG for two years after graduating from <italic>Harvard </italic>Business. \nWhile Mitt\u2019s mother was a Boston Brahmin Russell cousin, his father, George, was a cousin-in-law of Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith, FRS banker David Eccles, and hotelier John Marriott. George started at automobile manufacturer <italic>Nash</italic><italic> Motor</italic><italic> </italic>in 1948. <italic>Nash</italic> merged with <italic>Hudson Motor </italic>in 1952 to create <italic>American Motor</italic> George became CEO. \nIn 1962, George left to become a three-term Governor of Michigan and ran for the 1968 Republican Presidential nomination, though he lost to Richard Nixon. Also in 1977, <italic>Bain</italic> hired Israeli-born <italic>Harvard </italic>Business<italic> </italic>graduate Orit Gadiesh, the daughter of Falk Gadiesh, Managing Director of <italic>Monsanto</italic>-subsidiary<italic> Israel Chemical Fibre</italic> and Chair of Israel\u2019s <italic>Foreign Investor</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Organization</italic>. By 1981, <italic>Bain</italic> hired <italic>Harvard </italic>Business<italic> </italic>graduate and Boston Brahmin Meg Whitman from <italic>Proctor Gamble </italic>as a VP. By 1986, Bill Bain and senior partners sold 30% of their equity to an ESOP, funding Mitt Romney\u2019s <italic>Bain Capital </italic>to strategically invest in clients by grafting LBOs on to consulting.\nMeanwhile, the Guinness family no longer led the family brewer and kinterlinked with the Jewish Samuel of <italic>Hill Samuel</italic> in 1980. That following year, <italic>Guinness </italic>hired <italic>Bain </italic>to grow via acquisition. However, the <italic>Guinness </italic>scandal in 1987 tarnished <italic>Bain</italic>\u2019s reputation, resulting in legal issues for <italic>Guinness</italic> and client losses for <italic>Bain</italic>. These challenges, along with economic difficulties and high debt, necessitated a 10% reduction in <italic>Bain</italic>\u2019s workforce in 1988. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>, the ESOP debt further squeezed <italic>Bain</italic>. Of consultants that left, Meg Whitman joined <italic>Disney</italic>, which she helped acquire <italic>Discovery</italic>. \nTo address this crisis, Mitt Romney replaced Bill Bain as the head of <italic>Bain</italic> in 1991. Romney oversaw a recapitalization by 75 junior partners gaining equity over the 8 founding partners. Orit Gadiesh rallied senior partners to commit to the company, preventing further departures. As Romney left to run against long-term Senator of Massachusetts Edward Kennedy, Orit Gadiesh became the first female head of a consulting firm as the Chair of <italic>Bain </italic>from 1993. As Kennedy won again, Romney returned to <italic>Bain Capital</italic>. \nLike <italic>Bain </italic>fused consulting with LBOs and VCs, Larry Fink\u2019s <italic>BlackRock</italic> <italic>Financial Markets Advisory</italic> (\u201cFMA\u201d) did so with asset management. While <italic>Blackstone</italic>\u2019s affiliated fixed income manager, <italic>BlackRock</italic>, helped GE sell <italic>Kidder</italic> in 1994, <italic>Blackstone</italic> could not afford to keep her and sold her to <italic>Pittsburgh National Corp</italic> in 1995. \n<italic>BlackRock</italic> formed FMA as a separate consultancy division to couple regulatory expertise with bond pricing. Since Japan\u2019s <italic>Nikko </italic>bought a 20% interest in <italic>Blackstone</italic>, Sandy Weill\u2019s <italic>Smith Barney</italic> partnered with <italic>Nikko</italic>, leading AIG\u2019s Maurice Greenberg to acquire 7% of <italic>Blackstone</italic> in 1998 before <italic>Blackstone</italic> repurchased <italic>Nikko</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> stake. By 1999, <italic>BlackRock </italic>went public using <italic>Merrill</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Greg Fleming, who joined <italic>Merrill</italic> from <italic>Booz</italic>.\nOther Israeli women also prospered. The Holon-born daughter of a <italic>Uni of Massachusetts</italic> physics professor, Safra Catz grew up in America and graduated <italic>Wharton</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law before joining <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic> in 1994. After helping build <italic>Softbank</italic>, she became managing director until resigning in 1997 to join <italic>Oracle</italic>. However, Galia Maor became Israel\u2019s most powerful woman since Golda Meir. After the <italic>Panic of 1979</italic>, Israeli banks bought-back shares until investors ran from bank shares amidst fears of <italic>shekel</italic> devaluation in 1983. Preventing collapse via nationalization, <italic>Bank of Israel</italic> pledging to repay with interest. \nAlong with <italic>Bank Leumi</italic> losing her position of Israel\u2019s largest bank to <italic>Bank Hapoalim</italic>, public outrage flared in 1986 when <italic>Leumi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s </italic>Chair negotiated a \u2018golden parachute.\u2019 Having entered America in 1980, <italic>Bank Leumi</italic> targeted retail customers in diverse communities. Branching to White Plains and entering Westchester County in 1986, <italic>Bank Leumi</italic> became New York\u2019s largest bank serving Irish, Italian, and Puerto Rican customers. Following losses on retail American loans during the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>, <italic>Bank Leumi</italic> privatized in 1993, shifting from retail to corporate banking under CEO Maor. Maor served in senior posts at <italic>Bank of Israel</italic> from 1963 and as bank supervisor from 1982 until joining <italic>Bank Leumi</italic> in 1991.\nEarlier, President Reagan diversified government with conservative women. After appointing Patricia Diaz as second female and first Latina to <italic>National Labor Relations Board</italic> in 1983, he named her the first Latina Director of <italic>Federal Communications Commission</italic> (\u201cFCC\u201d) in 1986. By 1987, Reagan appointed Texas Senator Phil Gramm\u2019s wife, Hawaiian-born Wendy Lee Gramm, as one of the few Asian-Americans in federal leadership to Chair of CFTC in 1987 after Susan Phillips. \nThe Gramm power couple faced competition. After graduating <italic>Harvard</italic> Business, the daughter of Taiwanese American James Chao\u2014schoolmate Jiang Zemin and founder of<italic> Foremost Shipping</italic>\u2014Elaine, started as an international banker at <italic>Citi</italic> in 1979. Leaving for a one-year White House fellowship in 1983, Elaine met the first female Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole, wife of a Republican North Carolina Senator. From 1984, Chao worked as a syndications VP at <italic>Bank of America</italic> until 1986, when she accepted in executive <italic>Federal Maritime Commission </italic>appointments. By then, the Chao family began supporting Senator Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. As President Bush Sr promoted Elizabeth Dole to Secretary of Labor in 1988, Elizabeth helped Chao become Bush Sr\u2019s Deputy Secretary of Transportation. By 1993, Elaine married McConnell.\nBush Sr also reappointed Wendy Lee Gramm as Chair of CFTC. While <italic>Enron</italic> supported her husband Texas Senator Phil Gramm, Lee Gramm exempted OTC derivatives\u2014except for prohibitions against fraud and manipulation\u2014from regulation in 1993. (Lee Gramm joined <italic>Enron</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> board soon after.) So, OTC derivatives blossomed. Often compared to Insull\u2019s PU empire, <italic>Enron </italic>is rooted with PA1935.\nWhen FDR federalized energy regulation, PA1935 broke <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s <italic>United</italic> and Insull\u2019s PUIHCs in the 1940s into bits, including <italic>Southern</italic>, <italic>American Electric Power</italic> (\u201cAEP\u201d) and <italic>Entergy</italic> between Florida and Ohio. Along with federal TVA and large California\u2019s <italic>Pacific Gas & Electric</italic> (\u201cPG&E\u201d), these PUHCs were the largest into the 1990s as PA1935 limited inter-state competition. While coal political power eased the way for <italic>Southern </italic>and <italic>Entergy</italic>, Donald Cook led AEP. Having started at SEC in 1935, Cook became Chair in 1953. Turning down UST posts, he led AEP (until he left to lead <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> transition from Meyer to Weill after 1976.) \nAs ICC regulated inter-state railroad, trucking, and pipe rates\u2014along with oil and natural gas prices\u2014and FPC oversaw electric PUHCs under PA1935 and forbade fuel ownership. While PUHCs increasingly entered long-term raw energy contracts, their profits fell as CA1970 taxed high-sulfur Eastern coal emissions on one side, and FPC prevented retail rate hikes despite the oil supply shock and PUHC union strikes on the other. After regulating gas producers and pipes in 1938, FPC kept prices low. After the <italic>Panic of 1960</italic>, FRS, Congress, and UST shifted monetary policy from low inflation to stable employment, fixing prices with leases and long-term contracts. \nSimilarly, FPC extended electricity contracts terms by forcing producers to charge pipes the weighted average cost. Producers and pipes used rebates and surcharges to resolve differences between short-term prices and long-term contracts. Pipes mirrored these contracts to distributing PUHCs. But low prices stymied investment, oil supply shocks unleashed inflation. So, PA1978 de-monopolized PUHCs wires to spur energy competition. \nTA1978 and subsequent lease and deprecation tax reforms fostered energy investment. After the <italic>Panic of 1979</italic>, Congress restructured FPC into <italic>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission </italic>(\u201cFERC\u201d) and deregulated gas pipes. Shortages became surpluses as prices stimulated investment and mergers. To hedged producer contracts, pipes mirrored with local gas distributors until FERC invalidated it in 1984. \nLeaving academia, John Sawhill worked at <italic>McKinsey</italic> and CCC until joining OMB\u2019s energy division. Nixon promoted Sawhill to lead FEA during the <italic>Panic of 1973</italic>, but Ford forced him out for promoting gasoline taxes. Carter named Sawhill Deputy Energy Secretary in 1977 and Chair of Carter\u2019s <italic>Synthetic Fuels Corp</italic>, the federal coal liquification corporation, from 1980 until Reagan shuttered it. So, Sawhill returned to lead <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s energy practice, with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jeff Skilling.\nLosing sales to cheap oil from refiner <italic>Koch </italic>in Minnesota, Nebraska-based <italic>InterNorth</italic>\u2014which supplied Insull back in 1930\u2014hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> to invest gains on long-term contract. While <italic>El Paso Corp </italic>alleviated the losses with \u2018market out clauses\u2019, <italic>InterNorth</italic> sold non-gas operations, and <italic>Houston Natural Gas</italic>\u2014led by the son of a Missouri preacher, Kenneth Lay\u2019s\u2014avoided a hostile takeover to merge with <italic>InterNorth</italic>. With Lay as CEO, the firm became <italic>Enron</italic> and issued HYB with DBL. While Lay earlier lobbied Congress to impair contracts, he shifted at <italic>Enron</italic> to create the inter-state gas spot market and close-out contracts. Other pipes sold buying obligations to industrial end-users at below-contract prices. After courts ruled this discriminatory, FERC allowed local distributors to buy gas from any pipe, transitioning <italic>Enron</italic>, <italic>El Paso Corp</italic>, and other pipes from merchants to open-access transporters.\nAs the global oil cartel collapsed in late 1985, FERC squeezed pipes by voiding contracts for end-use sales but not with producers. And then TA1986 hiked taxes. As <italic>Enron</italic> became a takeover candidate, she was too indebted for a <italic>KKR</italic> management LBO. With Rohatyn\u2019s \u2018White Knight\u2019 fund to avoid takeovers, <italic>Lazard</italic> and DBL helped <italic>Enron</italic> remain independent with an ESOP. As <italic>Entergy</italic> became a <italic>McKinsey</italic> client in 1986, consultant<italic> </italic>Jeff Skilling advised <italic>Enron</italic> to become a gas bank and hedge prices in 1987. Since PUs could no longer avoid takeovers, states enacted anti-takeover laws. Six years after the <italic>Three Mile Island</italic> disaster, SEC\u2019s FASB provided accounting relief for PUs to write off nuclear investments. These laws continued limiting PUHC, which remained smaller than international peers (and the dissolved AT&T bits). \nBut gas pipe contract mismatches continued. After a court compelled them in 1987, FERC allowed them to pass the producers\u2019 cost. As the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic> dimmed oil demand, Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. While the Soviet Union joined America and the international community in the <italic>Gulf War</italic>, domestic <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</italic> stores and international oil stockpiles established following the 1973 embargo mitigated supply disruptions in America, resulting in oil prices remaining 30% above prewar levels into 1992. Without such reserves, emerging markets like India watched FX reserves collapse to less than a month\u2019s worth of imports by June 1991 along with industrial production as inflation soared.\nHiring <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Skilling, <italic>Enron</italic> locked gas supply and satisfied long-term contracts and natural gas futures trading to hedge prices. Lobbying SEC to become a gas bank, <italic>Enron </italic>lobbying was widespread and well received. CA1990 finance coal scrubbers via trading emissions instead of taxing PUs. Without DBL\u2019s HYB financing,<italic> Columbia Gas</italic> filed for bankruptcy in 1991, and investors ran from energy firms with long-term contracts. \nRather than impair <italic>Columbia Gas</italic>-type contracts, SEC approved <italic>Enron</italic> to be the first non-financial to value long-term contracts using mark-to-market in 1991. <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s lobbying did not stop at CFTC and SEC. PA1992 completed the shift of gas pipes from merchants into open-access transporters and overturned PA1935 for PUHCs to own gas and international assets. Along with British energy privatization and <italic>BANK</italic>, <italic>Enron</italic> lobbied to buy foreign PUs. Likewise, <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s lobbying also relaxed FERC merger guidelines policies, which combined with PA1992 to spur energy mergers.\nMoreover, <italic>Enron</italic> benefited from fallout after the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic> accelerated derivatives reforms. As Congress required that derivatives trade on exchanges under CFTC regulation 1974, large broker dealers sought to trade nonstandard OTC derivatives without exchanges. After Congress granted CFTC explicit authority to exempt OTC derivatives between \u2018appropriate persons\u2019 sought to provide legal certainty for interest rate swaps in 1992, FRS proposed to expand the enforceability of DA1989 netting contracts by expanding the scope to nonbanks in May 1993. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Lazard</italic> expanded from municipal advisory into higher-margin municipal bond underwriting using firm capital in 1985. To lead this effort, <italic>Lazard</italic> hired William DelGiudice, former chief of staff to the governor of New York. As DelGiudice recruited government aides from various states, including Mark Ferber from Massachusetts, <italic>Lazard</italic> soon led underwriting. From 1989, Ferber advised on the nation\u2019s largest public works project, the cleaning of Boston\u2019s polluted harbor. However, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s position as an impartial advisor prevented it from selling interest-rate swaps to issuers. As a work around, <italic>Lazard</italic> split revenues with <italic>Merrill</italic>. Neither firm disclosed the arrangement to the public. By early 1993, Ferber had left <italic>Lazard</italic> for a competitor. \n<italic>Lazard</italic> also continued to steer national politics. Since Democrat Rohatyn initially supported Ross Perot\u2014whom he knew since the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>\u2014thus splitting the Republican vote with Bush Sr, and letting Clinton Administration win the 1992 Presidential election. Clinton\u2019s VP running mate was a fellow Southerner, Al Gore, whose father represented Tennessee in Congress from 1938 until 1952 and served in the Senate from 1953 to 1970. \nWhile Gore and Senator Lyndon Johnson of Texas were two of the three Southern Senators to support the Court\u2019s desegregation of public schools along with, Gore criticized President Johnson in 1968 for the Vietnam War. Instead of Rohatyn, President-elect Clinton named <italic>Goldman</italic> co-Chair Robert Rubin as <italic>Assistant to the President for Economic Policy</italic> and as Director of the new <italic>National Economic Council</italic> in 1993. (Rubin\u2019s maternal grandfather was heavily involved in Brooklyn\u2019s Democratic political machine.)\nClinton\u2019s chose Hazel O\u2019Leary to be the first woman and Black to lead DOE in 1992. Since O\u2019Leary was born to two doctors in segregated Newport News, Virginia, she graduated <italic>Fisk Uni</italic>, a private historically Black liberal arts college in Tennessee, and <italic>Rutgers Law School</italic> in the 1960s. \nAfter she became a prosecutor in Essex County focusing on organized crime cases, she worked at the DOE in the early 1980s, she joined Byllesby\u2019s <italic>Northern States</italic> PUHC in Minnesota in 1989, oversaw legal and personnel departments, environmental affairs, public relations, and lobbying. <italic>Northern States</italic> soon grew into one of the nation\u2019s largest PUHCs. After an overspending scandal led O\u2019Leary to resign in early 1997, she joined her husband\u2019s consulting firm and later served as president and COO at <italic>Blaylock</italic>, a Black investment bank.\nWhile <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette </italic>co-founder William Donaldson became Head of NYSE in 1991, his one-time rival Arthur Levitt became SEC Chair in 1993. The son of New York\u2019s Comptroller, Levitt formerly partnered with <italic>Smith Barney</italic>\u2019s Sanford Weill and <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Frank Zarb. He also chaired <italic>American Stock Exchange</italic> and <italic>New York City Economic Development Corp</italic>. At SEC, Levitt protected investors with the rise of the Internet. Since 1938\u2019s historical cost accounting for allowing S&Ls to hide losses, SEC guided the <italic>Financial Accounting Standards Board</italic> (\u201cFASB\u201d) to re-introduce mark-to-market to banks. As DOJ relaxed bank merger guidelines and Congress reversed BHCA1956 to allow inter-state branching in 1994, banks merged to diversify.\nAs Los Angeles and other municipal budgets worsened, <italic>Lazard</italic> advised projects to refinance to lower yields bonds and invest the excess funds into UST bonds. <italic>Lazard</italic> profited under lower interest rates by artificially reducing yields on the UST bonds, without disclosing to their clients. By late 1993, SEC investigated municipal finance improprieties, and <italic>Lazard</italic> replaced DelGiudice to aid investigators as cities cancelled contracts. \nEarlier, Austrian-born Heinz Schimmelbusch spent several years in America with <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Morgan Stanley</italic>, and <italic>Goldman</italic> before joining <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> in 1973. By the early 1990s, he was chairman of <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> and a member of <italic>Dresdner</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>\u2019s board. From 1991, he retained <italic>McKinsey</italic> Munich partner Michael Roever to restructure <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>. However, <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> Chair Ronaldo Schmitz opposed <italic>McKinsey</italic> in favor of <italic>Roland Berger</italic>, affiliated with <italic>Deutsche</italic>, with him on both boards.\nWhile <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> maintained oil futures hedges against rising prices, the positions produced losses as prices fell in 1993. Roever identified related liquidity transfers from Frankfurt to New York and reported them to Schimmelbusch, who incorporated the findings into financial controls. When Schimmelbusch sought loans from creditor-shareholders <italic>Deutsche</italic> and <italic>Dresdner</italic> to maintain the positions, Schmitz forced liquidation, realizing the losses and resulting in Schimmelbusch\u2019s dismissal. The subsequent bank bailout, cost-cutting, divestments, and exit from American oil operations prevented Germany\u2019s largest post-WWII bankruptcy.\nAs FRS raised interest rates in 1994 for the first time since the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>, OTC derivative swap losses multiplied. Consumer products firm <italic>Procter & Gamble</italic> settled a fraud lawsuit against <italic>Bankers Trust</italic>, who forgave the debt related to OTC FX and interest rate swaps. However, CFTC and SEC fined <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> for misleading <italic>Gibson Greeting Cards</italic> regarding interest rate swaps. \nAs gas had the highest volatility of traded future, a California municipality speculation with energy derivatives set a bankruptcy record and a large fine to <italic>Merrill</italic>. So,  subjected municipal bankruptcies to explicit state permission. BA1994 overturned the <italic>New Deal</italic> BA1938, in line with the Court\u2019s argument before FDR threatened to pack the court. By 1995, <italic>Lazard</italic> shuttered the municipal department by 1995. In late 1996, Ferber was sentenced to prison, <italic>Merrill </italic>and <italic>Lazard</italic> settled. <italic>Merrill</italic>, however, hired <italic>Yale</italic> Law grad and <italic>Booz </italic>Principal Greg Fleming to restructure the muni division and soon lead investment banking for financial institutions.\nAs BA1994 exempted FX swaps from the bankruptcy stay, swap innovation multiplied. Since <italic>Exxon</italic>\u2019s oil tanker ran aground in Alaska in an environmental and financial catastrophe, a $5 billion fine led <italic>Exxon</italic> to take out a credit line from <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Barclay </italic>in 1993. By late 1994, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Blythe Masters innovated credit default swaps bond insurance, which <italic>Morgan </italic>sold to EBRD. Under this agreement, <italic>European Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> (\u201cEBRD\u201d) would receive a fee from <italic>Morgan </italic>if <italic>Exxon</italic> defaulted. Masters became <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s youngest female director shortly after. (Ahead of Soviet dissolution, American, France, and Japan agreed to create EBRD as a sort of mix of EC, <italic>BANK</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic>.)\nBill and Hillary Clinton, known as \u2018Billary\u2019, formed a strong political partnership during their 12-year leadership of Arkansas from 1979 to 1992, they collaborated on rural policy, educational reforms, and child-focused programs. Although Bill\u2019s effort to appoint their friend Jim Blair as Chair of FHLB failed, Bill appointed Hillary on <italic>Legal Services Corp</italic>\u2019s board based on both merit and political services. While Clinton nominated Felix Rohatyn for FRS Vice Chair, Republican opposition forced Rohatyn despite support from Jesse Jackson and Ross Perot. So, Clinton\u2019s promoted <italic>Goldman</italic><italic>-</italic>alum Robert Rubin to UST Secretary. \nFor UST Deputy Secretary, Clinton\u2019s appointed academic royal Lawrence Summers. Lawrence\u2019s mother, Anita Arrow held key positions as Head of the Urban Section in FRS <italic>Philadelphia</italic>\u2019s research department and various leadership roles at <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic>. Lawrence\u2019s father changed his surname and is the brother of Paul Samuelson. In 1970, Paul became the first American to win the <italic>Nobel Prize</italic> in economics. His brother-in-law, Kenneth Arrow, won that award two years later. While a Professor at <italic>Harvard</italic>, Lawrence was impressed by an undergraduate final, and hired Sheryl Sandberg as his research assistant at <italic>BANK</italic> and then UST. With stints at <italic>McKinsey</italic> while getting her MBA at <italic>Harvard</italic> soon transitioned from shaping public to technology policy. \nPanics also shattered glass ceilings for women and other minorities. Starting her career at Britain\u2019s <italic>Exchequer</italic>, Frances Heaton joined <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1980, and became a director in 1987. After becoming the first female director of Britain\u2019s <italic>Panel on Takeovers & Mergers</italic> in 1992, Heaton was appointed as the first woman BOE non-executive director in 1993. Since spinning off <italic>Pearson</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s David Verey refused to leave Weill\u2019s <italic>Lazard</italic> to head <italic>Pearson</italic>. So,<italic> Lazard</italic> London promoted the first female CEO of the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>\u2019s hundred largest firms, with American-born Marjorie Scardino leading <italic>Pearson</italic> from 1997. (Several decades earlier, Katherine Meyer Graham\u2014the daughter of <italic>Lazard</italic> New York scion Eugene Meyer\u2014became CEO of the family-owned the <italic>Washington Post</italic> newspaper and the first female CEO of a <italic>Fortune 500</italic> company in 1963.)\nIn France, women held only 5% of directorships of the top 40 listed companies in 2003, below the European average. Unlike in Britain, many French female directors owe their positions to family ownership, with about 37% representing family investment companies. Examples include Liliane Bettencourt, who inherited large stakes in <italic>L</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Oreal</italic>, and <italic>Sodexho Alliance</italic>, where family members also play a role. State involvement is another factor, with women, such as Anne Lauvergeon, advanced. After serving at the <italic>Elysee Palace</italic> under President Mitterrand as Advisor for Economic International Affairs from 1991 until 1994, Lauvergeon became <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 sole female partner\u2014one of four across <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2014before becoming SVP at <italic>Alcatel</italic> <italic>Telecom</italic> in 1997, Chair and CEO of <italic>Cogema</italic> in 1999, and subsequently Chair and CEO of nuclear generator <italic>Areva</italic>.\nThe earliest female central bank chairs were primally appointed in Marxist and corrupt regimes of East Germany (1950-8; 1967-74), China (1985 to 1988), Laos (1988-92 and 1995-7), Bolivia (1985), Ecuador (1993-6), and Venezuela (1992-4). With the end of the <italic>Cold War</italic>, egalitarianism started in the new and border democracies. They included Austria (1990-5), Finland (1992-8), Russia (1994-5), Poland (1992-2000), Denmark (1995-2005), Kyrgyzstan (1996-7), with more starting after the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>. While several women held the role in Honduras from 1999, those in Denmark, Botswana, Barbados, Guyana, Turkmenistan, Cayman Islands, Tonga, and elsewhere remained in unelected power for over a decade. \nSpending most of her career at <italic>Bank of Finland</italic>, Sirkka H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen became Chair in 1992 during Finland\u2019s banking crisis, steering the economy toward stability and EMU membership by 1998. Finnish banking also restructured as <italic>Union Bank of Finland</italic>\u2014Finland\u2019s first commercial bank from 1862\u2014joined <italic>Kansallis-Osake-Pankki</italic> and two other banking groups to acquire and divided <italic>Suomen S\u00e4\u00e4st\u00f6pankki</italic>, formed in 1991. By 1995, <italic>Union Bank of Finland</italic> merged with <italic>Kansallis-Osake-Pankki</italic> to create <italic>Merita Bank</italic>. From the beginning, the executive board of <italic>European Central Bank</italic> (\u201cECB\u201d) had a female seat. Starting with H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen in 1998, Austria\u2019s Gertrude Tumpel Gugerell followed from 2003. \nSince the creation of the female FRS governor seat in 1978, Bush Sr appointed Susan Phillips\u2014CFTC\u2019s first female Chair\u2014to replace Martha Seger in 1991. By 1993, he named Alice Rivlin as the first female OMB director, who helped stabilize the <italic>dollar</italic>. Instead of a single female seat, Clinton added Janet Yellen as FRS governor in 1994. After promoting Rivlin as the first female FRS Vice Chair in 1996, Clinton named Yellen as the first female Head of the <italic>Council of Economic Advisers</italic> in 1997. The same year, Clinton appointed one of <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s first female partner, Nancy Killefer, as assistant secretary for UST\u2019s CFO and COO. Likewise, Clinton promoted Blacks. In Rivlin\u2019s stead in 1996, Clinton named <italic>Lazard</italic> partner Franklin Raines the first Black OMB director. Within a year, Clinton named <italic>McKinsey</italic> partner Roger Ferguson the first Black FRS Vice Chair.\nWhile Congress considered regulating OTC derivatives regulators, financial institutions and FRS Chair Greenspan resisted. and retired <italic>Arnold Porter</italic> partner Brooksly Born as CFTC Chair. As <italic>Sumitomo</italic> lost $2.6 billion on LME copper contracts, CFTC sued <italic>Sumitomo</italic> and <italic>Merrill </italic>for market manipulation. Amidst these negotiations, <italic>Lehman</italic> transferred Theodore Roosevelt IV from the international business to being Chair of Financial Products in 1994, followed by Chair of Derivative Products in 1998. While CFTC Chair Born sought to undo Wendy Lee Gramm\u2019s 1993 rule to regulate OTC derivatives, FRS Chair Greenspan, UST Secretary Rubin, UST Deputy Secretary Summers, and SEC Chair Levitt sought a moratorium against it in 1998. \nLikewise, female executives thrived. At 31, Paris-born Christine Lagarde became a partner at Chicago-based <italic>Baker McKenzie</italic> in 1987, perennially the world\u2019s largest law firm by headcount. At the age of 43\u2014a decade younger than her predecessor\u2014Lagarde took over the firm and reorganized it to record growth. Head of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s corporate debt restructuring, Ann Lane banked real estate magnate Donald Trump in 1990 and recapitalized Rupert Murdoch\u2019s <italic>News Corp</italic> in 1991. \nWhen Sanford Weill left <italic>American Express</italic> and took over<italic> Primerica </italic>in the late 1980s, Heidi Goldberg Miller became his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. With a <italic>Yale</italic> PhD in Latin American history, Miller joined <italic>Chemical</italic> NB, and established their Latin debt trading and corporate finance group. After hiring Miller as <italic>Primerica </italic>CFO in 1992, Weill bought<italic> </italic><italic>Shearson Loeb</italic>\u2019s retail broker from <italic>American Express</italic>, and merged with business insurer <italic>Travelers</italic> by 1994. Along the way, Miller played a crucial role in major mergers and acquisitions, which continued. By 1997, <italic>Berkshire </italic>sold <italic>Salomon</italic> to Sanford Weill\u2019s <italic>Smith Barney</italic>. \nWhile nepotism promoted gender balance, it fueled discord. Since he gained control of <italic>Shearson</italic> in the 1970s, Sanford Weill\u2019s children, Jessica and Marc, knew <italic>Shearson</italic> legacy Jamie Dimon. In the early 1990s, Marc managed a $3 billion portfolio at <italic>Travelers</italic>, with Dimon as his mentor. In 1994, Dimon hired Jessica as an EVP at <italic>Smith Barney</italic>, where she reported directly to him. He promoted her to Chair of the mutual fund operations in 1995. Tensions arose in mid-1996 when Dimon advocated for selling no-load mutual funds to compete with <italic>Vanguard</italic>, which conflicted with Jessica\u2019s preference for internal funds. In 1997, Dimon excluded her from a key planning committee, which Weill viewed as a slight. This led Jessica to resign. Weill then sought to place Marc in charge of the firm\u2019s fixed income arbitrage group in 1998. Dimon opposed this decision, believing Marc lacked the necessary skills and required him to report to him for oversight. Facing criticism, Marc left <italic>Smith Barney</italic> in 2000 to start his own VC firm, further straining Dimon and Weill\u2019s relationship.\nAfter <italic>Salomon</italic> ousted him as CEO during the trading scandal, John Meriwether and a group of <italic>Salomon</italic> traders started <italic>Long-Term Capital Management</italic> (\u201cLTCM\u201d) hedge fund. As BA1994 exempted FX swaps from the bankruptcy stay, LTCM leveed equity 25x using OTC derivatives from <italic>Safra</italic> and global banks. By mid-1997, investors ran from East Asia. As the run spread, FRS lowered interest rates in April 1998, and Russia defaulted in August. \nLTCM lost 80% of her equity after betting that Russian bonds would yield less than American debt. Feared that derivatives counterparties would run from LTCM in a SIPA liquidation, FRS Chair Greenspan organized the firm\u2019s trading partners to reorg LTCM\u2019s debt. Since legislation through BA1994 exempted derivatives from automatic stays, counterparties closed out over-collateralized positions at fire sale prices. Without a bailout, LTCM\u2019s strategies soon became profitable again.\nAs another quantitative hedge fund, <italic>Renaissance Technology</italic>, tax arbitraged basket options\u2014converting short-term trading profits into leveraged long-term capital gains\u2014<italic>Deutsche</italic> launched a similar product. While TA1999 banned the practice, <italic>Renaissance Technology</italic> and<italic> </italic>other hedge funds continued for decades, and along with wealthy families joined <italic>S-corps</italic>\u2014also taxed as \u2018small\u2019 businesses on pass-through income\u2014to lobby for lower taxes over <italic>C-corps</italic>. \nAfter <italic>McKinsey</italic> consultant Roger Ferguson married White <italic>Davis Polk</italic>-attorney Anette Nazareth in 1986, Nazareth served as <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s Senior Counsel, advising the fixed income division from 1994 until becoming Managing Director of <italic>Smith Barney</italic> in 1997, where she was Deputy Head of the Capital Markets Legal group. As Sanford Weill disbanded Meriwether\u2019s old bond arbitrage group to lower <italic>Salomon</italic>\u2019s risk profile, his <italic>Smith Barney</italic> merged with <italic>Citi</italic> by 1998, creating a \u2018global financial supermarket.\u2019 The merger dealt the final blow to the rift, which led Weill\u2019s former deputy and <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s next-in-line CEO Jaime Dimon to leave, and soon become head of <italic>Bank One</italic> (which had acquired <italic>First USA</italic> with <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s advice). \nAfter Dimon left, Victor Menezes and Michael Carpenter became joint CEOs of <italic>Salomon Smith Barney</italic> in November 1998. <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s former CFO, Menezes had joined <italic>Citi</italic> in India after college, and was named President of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s bank unit and co-CEO of the corporate and investment bank with Carpenter, who had led <italic>Travelers</italic>\u2019 life and annuity division and managed <italic>Kidder Peabody</italic> during her 1994 trading losses. In 2000, Heidi Miller left her position as <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s CFO to join <italic>Priceline.com</italic>, an internet startup specializing in discounted travel bookings. After her stint at <italic>Priceline</italic>, Miller went on to work with insurance broker <italic>Marsh</italic>, in 2001, and then joined some of Weill\u2019s old associates at <italic>Bank One</italic> by 2002.\nBy 1999, Rubin left UST, Clinton replaced him with Summers. Rubin soon becoming Vice Chair of <italic>Citi</italic>. Weeks after LTCM, Gramm led Congress in codifying the moratorium of CFTC regulation of OTC derivatives. While SEC Chair Levitt cracked down on NASDAQ abuses, his former co-partner Frank Zarb left <italic>Lazard</italic> to head NASD and merge the American and Philadelphia exchanges into his group\u2019s <italic>NASDAQ</italic>. After President Clinton reappointed him to a second five-year SEC Chair appointment in 1998, Arthur Levitt hired Nazareth. While at <italic>Smith Barney</italic>, Annette Nazareth represented SEC at a charity event in DC, thanks to her husband\u2019s FRS connection. After accepting a lunch with SEC\u2019s Arthur Levitt, Nazareth served as his top aide and the Director of the Division of Market Regulation at SEC from 1999, overseeing the supervision and regulation of American securities markets. As Nazareth remained at SEC, Levitt left in 2001 to become <italic>Carlyle</italic> LBO\u2019s Senior Advisor, where he soon reported to Lou Gerstner, formerly of <italic>McKinsey</italic>, RJR, and IBM.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panic of 2000</italic>\nCongress allowed ICC to regulate trucking in 1935 to reduce ruinous competition against railroads. Following the inflation of the 1970s, they deregulated truck carrier-customer terms from standardized ICC tariffs to negotiate lower common law contracts with the <italic>Motor Carrier Act of 1980</italic> (\u201cMC80\u201d). By easing entry, MC80 increased concentration and bankruptcies. Since MC80 required truckers to file nominal tariff rates with ICC, bankruptcy trustees sought to collect the difference of carrier filed over negotiated rates from customers. \nAs ICC ruled that carriers could only enforce contracted rates, the Court rejected such discrimination as offensive of IA1987 in 1990. After limiting carrier demand rates and allowing rate ranges, Congress eliminated contract filing requirements. By 1995, they dissolved the independent ICC agency, transferring control to the<italic> Transportation Department</italic>. \nHealthcare had avoided Federal regulation for much of the century. Generally, those who can afford to pay must cross-subsidize costs to achieve universal access. In advocating regulated big business, Theodore Roosevelt supported health insurance. However, Wilson\u2019s victory in 1912 shifted policy against market power. Southwestern electricity cooperatives inspired medical cooperative organizations during the 1929 utility boom. While physician offices cross-subsidized after the 1930s, FDR did not regulate the <italic>American Medical Association</italic> during the <italic>New Deal</italic> and allowed the lobby to restrict competition and inflate consumer prices. States and UST\u2014using Medicare after 1964\u2014subsidized care until inflationary deficits led Congress to mandate employers establish <italic>health maintenance organizations</italic> (\u201cHMOs\u201d) in 1973, shifting cross-subsidization to insurers.\nUsing tax-exempt debt, HMOs integrated health care services with insurance until TA1986. On the insurance demand side, reduced enrollment by raising after-tax benefits costs. And on the supply side, it reduced bank demand for tax-exempt bonds and required non-profit hospitals to serve the uninsured. And as HMO failures grew, courts prevented the state-regulated entities from sharing inter-state assets. So, HMOs converted into for-profits and merged to access the capital markets. As HMOs increased insurance premiums to compensate for their losses, enrollment fell. \nDespite the HMO mergers and soaring prices, the Court ruled in 1995 that HMOs held limited market share in the broader health market. However, the Court opened the door to direct health care taxation. President Clinton failed to convince Congress to nationalize or regulate HMOs as public utilities. So, Congress began enforcing 1986 requirements that all emergency rooms receiving Medicare treat the uninsured. As the higher costs resumed HMO and hospital mergers, Congress enacted . As TA1997 reduced Medicare payouts, the beleaguered HMOs charged patients more and decreased enrollment.\nIn 1988, bank regulators promoted derivatives markets to provide banks with credit risk transfer instruments. After DOJ closed BCCI for money laundering in 1991, FA1991 allowed FRS to oversee foreign banks operating in America. However, heavy auditor lobbying pushed Congress to limit external audit liability by 1995. Then, Congress enacted the  (\u201cDA1991\u201d). DA1991 required FRS to shutter the discount window to weak banks and required presidential approval for FDIC bailouts of systemically important\u2014<italic>too-big-to-fail</italic>\u2014banks. Moreover, DA1991 extended stay exemptions from swaps to all nettable derivative claims to bolster bank setoffs and decrease bankruptcy risk. And non-nettable swaps fell in priority as  elevated domestic deposit claims over those of foreigners and general creditors. \nTA1993 promoted entrepreneurship over NOC protection. Before 1993, IRS allowed taxable mergers to amortize and deduct intangible assets. However, goodwill\u2014the premium paid over tangible assets\u2014was fully expensed. IRS litigation over intangibles\u2019 valuation and useful lives grew after the Court held all intangible assets reviewable. To reduce court cases, TA1993 standardized the amortization of intangibles\u2014including goodwill\u2014to 15 years. While goodwill amortization reduced accounting earnings generally, only non-<italic>C-corp</italic> acquisitions created tax-deductible goodwill. Lengthening the lives of software development and client lists, TA1993 also disallowed write-offs in case of asset impairment. So, acquirers paid less to acquire <italic>C-</italic><italic>corps</italic> or merged in stock-for-stock transactions to pool assets without creating goodwill accounting expenses.\nSince TA1986 prohibited passive partnership losses and NOC trafficking, startups\u2014with upfront losses and a low probability of future gains\u2014formed corporate joint ventures. <italic>C-corps</italic> sought these ventures\u2019 NOCs as TA1986 increased corporate taxes beyond individual rates. TA1993 reversed TA1986 by increasing personal income taxes above corporate and capital gains rates. TA1993 also eliminated BT81\u2019s tax-free stock for debt swaps that delayed illiquid corporations\u2019 bankruptcy. \nTA1993 also fostered VC investing with privileged capital gains for small<italic> C-corps</italic>. VCs pushed startups into <italic>C-corps</italic> since only this form qualified for the privileged capital gains tax. However, <italic>C-corps</italic> could neither use the NOCs themselves nor pass them through to investors. For acquirers, these firms offered neither NOCs nor tax-reducing goodwill, so their primary option to improve profitability was pooling assets in stock-for-stock mergers. \nCongress also made exits more attractive. Whereas BA1978 treated all companies equally\u2014large or small, public or private, corporation or partnership\u2014 fast tracked Federal small businesses liquidation process. At the same time, they streamlined the <italic>Small Business Administration</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> (\u201cSBA\u201d) debt securitization to mirror TA1986\u2019s real estate mortgage process. By 1996, Congress created a tax-exempt entity to stimulate small business investment and ordered UST to devise regulations.  \nSince 1968, Hambrecht Quist dominated tech IPOs in California, inviting <italic>Morgan </italic>Stanley\u2019s tech banker, Frank Quattrone, to Apple\u2019s 1980 IPO. While they then pivoted to competitive bidding, investors saw a little interest without investment bank market making. With humble roots, Quattrone and his \u2018friends\u2019 intermediated capital out of a California branch, like Michael Milken, with deep startup and VC relationships. From taking <italic>Cisco</italic> public in 1990, Quattrone helped start the <italic>Tech Boom</italic> with <italic>Netscape</italic>\u2019s 1995 IPO. While <italic>Sequoia</italic> had funded and nurtured <italic>Cisco</italic> since 1984 and <italic>Yahoo </italic>in 1995, <italic>Kleiner Perkins</italic> funded <italic>Netscape</italic> and a dozen other companies that went public in 1995. \n<italic>Netscape</italic> was rooted in graphical interface. While <italic>Stanford</italic> professor Jim Clark developed 3-dimensional graphics, he had trouble selling to existing computer companies. So, he founded <italic>Silicon Graphics</italic> computer workstation manufacture, in 1982, which <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> took public in 1986. Unable to guide the company into low-cost, network-friendly hardware, Clark left <italic>Silicon Graphics</italic> in 1994. To start a new software company related to interactive TV, <italic>Netscape</italic>, Clark recruited Marc Andreessen of <italic>Mosaic</italic>, a graphical interface for finding Internet sites without programming knowledge. \nWithin its first 18 months,<italic> Mosaic</italic> increased Internet users by 300% and the number of web sites by a factor of 100. Developing in parallel to <italic>Mosaic</italic>, <italic>Time Warner</italic> and other companies invested in interactive TV set-top boxes. After the launch of <italic>Netscape</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> <italic>Navigator</italic> browser, although sensing a bubble, Bill Gates\u2019 <italic>Microsoft</italic> introduced <italic>Internet Explorer 2.0</italic>, offering it as a free download and incorporating the browser into the new <italic>Windows 95</italic> operating system. \n<italic>Netscape</italic> and <italic>Microsoft</italic> then competed on strategic alliances. While <italic>Netscape</italic> teamed up with <italic>MasterCard</italic>, <italic>Microsoft</italic> and <italic>Visa</italic> announced a partnership. Soon afterward, <italic>Netscape</italic> teamed up with GTE, MCI, and <italic>America Online</italic>. In late 1995, <italic>Netscape</italic> negotiated with large PC manufacturers into adding <italic>Navigator</italic> to the operating system in their computers. While some liked the idea, in late 1995 said they were prohibited for reasons they could not legally disclose. So, <italic>Netscape</italic> contacted DOJ in early 1996. As <italic>Yahoo</italic> went public in 1996, <italic>Sequoia</italic> and <italic>Kleiner</italic> <italic>Perkins</italic> funded <italic>Google</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Kleiner</italic> <italic>Perkins</italic> invested in <italic>Amazon</italic>.\nWith soaring debt, <italic>Time Warner</italic> initiated a restructuring phase marked by debt renegotiations. Seeking new leadership, <italic>Time Warner</italic> enlisted Richard Parsons as President in 1995, who had previously rescued <italic>Dime Savings Bank</italic> from bankruptcy. As Parsons oversaw various corporate functions, including filmed entertainment, music businesses, and administrative affairs, he was invited to <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s board in 1996, where he would remain for 16 years. Despite financial challenges, <italic>Time Warner</italic> continued expanding, buying <italic>Turner </italic><italic>Broadcasting System </italic>in 1996 after <italic>Westinghouse</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> acquired CBS. The same year, GE used NBC\u2019s 24-hour cable channel, CNBC to form a JV with <italic>Microsoft</italic> and launch of MSNBC, a 24-hour cable news network and Internet site.\nBy yearend, Congress enacted the <italic>National Securities Markets Improvement Act</italic> (\u201cSA1996\u201d), preempting state regulatory authority and streamlining federal securities laws. Amending SA1933 and SA1940, SA1996 exempted private firms from inter-state IPO registration for standardized listings. California followed by similarly exempting VCs. Likewise,  stimulated IPOs with lower capital gains taxes and allowed capital gains rollovers for small <italic>C-corps</italic>. By shortening the time to carry back losses for refunds and extending the period to carry losses forward, TA1997 emphasized the need to carry losses against future taxable income without immediate benefits from tax losses, driving a wedge between risky startups and large corporations.\nAfter taking <italic>Amazon</italic> public in 1997 and coming in second to <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> in IPOs performance in the two years after 1996, Quattrone and over 300 staff fled centralized <italic>Deutsche </italic><italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell </italic>for CSFB in 1998, where he oversaw research reports. While Quattrone led as many tech IPOs as <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> combined. But <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s deal values were larger. As online auction platform <italic>eBay</italic> grew rapidly, she faced competition from <italic>Yahoo</italic>, <italic>Onsale</italic>, <italic>First Auction</italic>, and <italic>Excite</italic>. \nBy 1998, <italic>eBay </italic>hired Meg Whitman\u2014who led a children\u2019s shoe manufacturer and <italic>Florists Transworld Delivery</italic> after leaving <italic>Bain </italic>and <italic>Disney</italic>\u2014to lead their IPO via <italic>Goldman</italic>. By 1999, <italic>Kleiner Perkin</italic>\u2019s saw multiple successful optical network exits, including <italic>Cisco</italic>\u2019s acquisition of <italic>Cerent</italic> in stock, <italic>Redback Networks</italic> stock acquisition of <italic>Siara</italic>, and IPO of router manufacturer <italic>Juniper Networks</italic>.  \n<italic>Goldman</italic>, meanwhile, faced her own transformations. Serving as co-Chair of <italic>Goldman</italic> alongside Robert Rubin from 1990, M&A head Stephen Friedman assumed sole leadership of the firm after Rubin departed to join the Clinton Administration in 1992. As Friedman retired, the Management Committee unanimously approved joint successors in 1994, with Jon Corzine as CEO and Hank Paulson as COO, neither of whom were Jewish. \nDisagreement between Corzine and Paulson grew over the firm\u2019s size and acquisition strategy, with Corzine favoring acquisitions like <italic>Salomon</italic> and <italic>Morgan </italic>while Paulson had concerns about overlaps and cultural clashes. The conflict escalated when Corzine\u2019s secret merger talks with <italic>Mellon Bank</italic> were revealed in 1998, resulting in a management shakeup. Paulson gained control of strategic discussions, setting the stage for <italic>Goldman</italic> to go public via an IPO in 1999 with the assistance of <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s former Vice Chair Kendrick Wilson.\nSince President Bush Sr\u2019s cousin George Walker of Saint-Louis graduated from <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> in 1992 and joined <italic>Goldman</italic> in Mergers & Acquisitions in New York, later working in London and Frankfurt. By 1998, Walker became one of the youngest partners in <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s history. In August 1999, he was appointed co-head of the firm\u2019s Wealth Management business as his cousin once removed campaigned for the presidency. Still, America\u2019s Jewish Golden Age blossomed as Clinton\u2019s VP Al Gore and his Jewish Senator Joe Lieberman narrowly lost to Bush Jr in the 2000 Presidential election. In 2011, Republican Congressman Eric Cantor of South Carolina became the first Jew to lead a chamber of Congress.\nWhile Rohatyn tried to lure CSFB\u2019s Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella to <italic>Lazard</italic>, they went independent instead and formed <italic>Wasserstein Perella </italic>by 1988, hiring Raymond McGuire as their first Black banker to open a Chicago office and advising on the <italic>Swiss Bank Corp-</italic>UBS merger. <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic> also raided <italic>Salomon</italic> for HYB staff, including Ashish Bhutani. After <italic>Morgan </italic>separated from <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> in the 1970s to compete in MMEU, <italic>Morgan Grenfell</italic> suffered through the <italic>Guinness</italic> scandal of 1985, and was taken over by <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> in 1989. On the other hand, British <italic>Barclay</italic> bought German <italic>Merck Finck</italic>.\nEuropeans bought British private banks after a <italic>Baring</italic> Singapore derivatives trader hid large losses in early 1995. As Dutch ING bought <italic>Lambert</italic> Brussels, <italic>Baring</italic>, and <italic>Berliner Frankfurter</italic>, <italic>Swiss Bank Corp </italic>acquired <italic>Warburg</italic>, <italic>Bank of Tokyo </italic>and<italic> Mitsubishi Bank </italic>Japanese fused into the world\u2019s largest bank, and Germany\u2019s second largest, <italic>Dresdner Bank</italic>, bought <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic>. By then Perella fell-out with Wasserstein, leaving <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic> for <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley </italic>in 1993 with Gary Parr, who became Head of M&A. Within a year, Raymond McGuire left <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic> to be <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s M&A managing director. From then, Ashish Bhutani led <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic> Securities.\nBlacks also made in roads at S&Ls. Since making Managing Partner at white-shoe law firm <italic>Patterson</italic> <italic>Belknap</italic>, Richard Parsons left in 1988 to become COO of <italic>Dime Savings Bank</italic>. When <italic>Dime</italic> named him President and CEO, Parsons became the first Black to lead a large S&L. His strategic initiatives, including the acquisition of <italic>Starpointe</italic> <italic>Savings Bank</italic> in 1988, expanded <italic>Dime</italic>\u2019s presence into consumer banking in New Jersey, and making the nation\u2019s 18th largest. As <italic>Dime Bank</italic> posted a profit after five consecutive years of losses, Parsons gained acclaim and a seat on <italic>Time Warner</italic>\u2019s board by 1992.\nLike the <italic>Civil Rights Act of 1964</italic> ensured Blacks to rise at banks, the <italic>Immigration Act of 1965</italic>, flooded Wall Street with a new wave of competitors in the 1980s, increasing income inequality. Hailing from places like Beirut, Bombay, Lahore, and Lagos, they were also offspring of immigrant families. Distinguished by their intelligence, these scholars held degrees in quantitative disciplines such as electrical engineering, physics, and applied mathematics.\nSince clerking for Justice Thurgood Marshall and joining CSFB in 1983, Nigerian-born Bayo Ogunlesi rose to head project finance, creating some of the first off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, and soon rivaling Quattrone in scope as he absorbed power, oil, and gas, and then chemicals groups. Bombay-born Muslim Arshad Zakaria, brother of <italic>Newsweek</italic> columnist Fareed, graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business before joining <italic>Merrill</italic> in 1987. Implementing tax shelters (with some invalidated as tax dodges), 28-year-old Zakaria rose to Managing Director by 1990. After earning a <italic>Columbia</italic> PhD and joining <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> in 1983, Vikram Pandit became Managing Director in seven years and headed the equity-derivatives business by 1994.\nOther immigrants were more recent. Victor Menezes was born in Pune to Goa descendants of Portuguese colonists. His father had  served as General Manager of <italic>Southeastern</italic> RR, Secretary of Defense Production, and Chair of the Railway Board. Victor graduated from IIT Bombay in 1970 and received a master\u2019s degree from MIT in 1972. He joined <italic>Citi</italic> the same year and held roles in India, South Asia, Hong Kong, China, Latin America, and Africa. He joined <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Policy Committee in 1985 and became EVP in 1989, overseeing European consumer operations. \nLikewise, women broke the glass ceiling. From Greece, Zoe Papadimitriou migrated to America as a child and later graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business. She married her classmate, Ernesto Cruz of Nicaragua, and after having three children, she became an FX trader at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> in 1982 and a Managing Director by 1990. The daughter of Washington state property developer Eugene Horbach, Sandra Horbach partner at <italic>Forstmann Little</italic> in 1992 at the unusually young age of 32, making her the first female partner at a major American private equity. \nWith a background in Chinese and Economics from <italic>Wellesley</italic> and <italic>Fudan</italic>, followed by an MBA from <italic>Stanford</italic>, she joined <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s M&A team. Similarly, the Israeli-born daughter of a <italic>Uni of Massachusetts</italic> physics professor, Safra Catz grew up in America and graduated <italic>Wharton</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law before joining <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic> in 1994. After helping build <italic>Softbank</italic>, she became managing director until resigning in 1997 to join <italic>Oracle</italic>.\nBorn in Brazil to Jewish parents, Dina Dublon immigrated to Israel as a child. After studying math and economics at <italic>Hebrew Uni</italic>, she started her career as a trader on <italic>Tel Aviv Stock Exchange </italic>and Israel\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Hapolim</italic>. Eventually, she moved to America with her husband, where she obtained a business degree from <italic>Carnegie Mellon</italic>. In 1981, she joined <italic>Chemical</italic> NB as an entry-level trader. Running <italic>Chemical</italic> since 1983, Walter Shipley\u2014whose father worked at <italic>Brown Harriman</italic>\u2014bought <italic>Texas Commerce</italic> (1987) and <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic> (1991) to become the 4th largest bank. While fellow Brazilian Jew<italic> Safra</italic> refused to buy America\u2019s largest BHC, <italic>Chase</italic>, Dublon helped <italic>Chemical</italic> buy <italic>Chase</italic> in 1996 before Shipley retired shortly after. \nArguably Wall Street\u2019s largest immigrant group per capita were Lebanese Christians fleeing the Civil War. Ziad Abdelnour sold HYB during Milken\u2019s tenure at DBL, George Boutros became a successful deal maker for CSFB and later co-chaired global technology banking at <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>, Walid Chammah led <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s investment bank, George Bitar held a high-ranking position in <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s private-equity division, and Philippe Jabre was an original partner of the London-based hedge fund <italic>GLG Partners</italic>. \nSince joining <italic>Morgan Stanle</italic>y from <italic>Smith Barney</italic> to sell bonds in 1972, John Mack, the son of Lebanese immigrants, became Head of Fixed Income in 1993 and promoted Zoe Cruz to Head of FX. Born in Kuwait to Lebanese parents, Fares Noujaim grew up in Brooklyn at 8, and worked odd jobs through a quantitative economics degree from <italic>Pace Uni</italic>. Having briefly worked at <italic>Goldman</italic>, Noujaim joined <italic>Bear </italic>in 1987. After Noujaim scored <italic>Ford</italic>\u2019s $9.5 billion bond as co-Head of <italic>Global Debt Capital Markets</italic>, CEO and Chair Jimmy Cayne elevated him to Vice Chair by 1998.                                        \nAfter <italic>Deutsche</italic><italic> Morgan</italic><italic> Grenfell</italic> poached <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanle</italic>y\u2019s Quattrone and his<italic> </italic>tech team in 1996, John Mack orchestrated a merger with Purcell\u2019s <italic>Dean Witter</italic> (who was advised by Wasserstein) in 1997. While Mack became President\u2014and promoted Zoe Cruz to Head of Fixed Income\u2014Purcell became Chair, expanding <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s reach, whose alumni were executives at <italic>American Express</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>Swiss Bank Corp Warburg</italic>, <italic>Lehman</italic>, HSBC, and UBS. From strategy, leadership, finance, to marketing, the alumni\u2019s range of practices is as impressive as the roster. \nSince the 1980s, Wall Street firms and banks in the America, Asia, and Europe expanded into large, complex institutions with diverse product lines, creating demand for <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s consulting services In the mid-1980s, HSBC brought in <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Steven Green to reorganize the treasury department and later hired and made him head of the merged capital markets unit at HSBC. \n<italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s principal consultant to <italic>Goldman</italic> Lawrence Linden joined <italic>Goldman</italic> as a partner in 1992 and became managing director in 1996 with responsibility for operations, technology, and finance. While <italic>McKinsey</italic> health care partner Stephan Sands started two biotech firms before joining <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in 1994,<italic> </italic><italic>McKinsey</italic> director John Cecil, who had advised <italic>American Express</italic> and <italic>Lehman</italic>, became Chief Administrative Officer of <italic>Lehman</italic> following her spin-off from <italic>American Express</italic>. He cut expenses by more than $300 million, imposed strict cost controls. <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s head of strategic management George Farr joined <italic>American Express</italic> as Vice Chair in 1995.\nThat year, the head of <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s European wholesale banking practice, George Feiger, joined SBC Warburg after advising <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic> on her acquisition of <italic>Warburg</italic>. At SBC <italic>Warburg</italic>, he replaced the firm\u2019s corporate advisory model with a product-based structure that prompted banker departures and the loss of clients such as <italic>Halifax Building Society</italic>. \nSince retaining <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 1981, the tiny <italic>North Carolina</italic> NB\u2019s Hugh McColl embarked on a transformative growth strategy. Acquiring <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Lake City</italic> in Florida in 1982, <italic>North Carolina</italic> NB expanded further, acquiring the subsidiaries of the struggling Dallas\u2019<italic> First Republic Bank</italic> in 1988. After <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic> of Atlanta and <italic>Sovran</italic> of Norfolk merged to avoid takeover by <italic>North Carolina</italic> NB, they all fused into <italic>NationsBank</italic> by 1991. <italic>Sullivan Cromwell</italic> advised on this transaction (as well as on the mergers of <italic>Manufacturers</italic> <italic>Hanover</italic> and <italic>Chemical </italic>and other major transactions that year.) \nAnd after America\u2019s most prominent Jewish banker, Richard Rosenberg, built <italic>Bank of America</italic> into the America\u2019s second largest BHC after the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic> and retired in 1996, <italic>NationsBank</italic> bought <italic>Montgomery Securities </italic>(advised by <italic>Lazard</italic>) and <italic>Bank of America</italic> to become America\u2019s largest BHC by 1998. Also in 1991, North Carolina\u2019s second largest BHC, <italic>First Union</italic>, bought Florida\u2019s largest BHC, <italic>Southeast Bancorp</italic> of Miami, which was taken over by FDIC.\nLike conglomerates, BHCs had to compete with private equity. As part of Texan oil magnate Robert Bass\u2019 LBO, David Bonderman acquired <italic>American Savings Bank</italic> in 1988. His implementation of a good bank/bad bank model set a precedent for similar strategies in the industry and Bonderman\u2019s future TPG. After selling <italic>American Savings Bank</italic> to <italic>Washington Mutual </italic>in 1996, Bonderman gained a <italic>Washington Mutual</italic> board seat. While initially selling large property pools, RTC began offering smaller pools to more investors in 1993. So, Bass joined with John Grayken\u2019s <italic>Lone Star Funds</italic> to acquire half-a-billion S&L mortgage portfolios from RTC by 1995, later achieving a 77% return.\nSince KKR allied with <italic>Fleet Norstar</italic> BHC to buy <italic>Bank of New England</italic> (\u201cBNE\u201d) after the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic> in 1991 from FDIC with a higher bid than <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of Boston </italic>and<italic> Bank of</italic> <italic>America</italic>, <italic>First NB of Boston </italic>fell behind, acquiring San Francisco-based investment bank <italic>Robertson Stephens</italic> from <italic>Bank of</italic> <italic>America</italic> in 1998 before merging with BNE in 1999. By 2004, the new <italic>Bank of</italic> <italic>America</italic> bought BNE-<italic>First NB of Boston</italic>. North Carolina\u2019s second and third largest banks also merged. \nAfter <italic>First Union</italic> sought assistance for a money losing unit<italic> </italic>from <italic>McKinsey</italic>, CSFB, and <italic>Merrill</italic> in 2000, <italic>Wachovia</italic> followed <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s advice to become a \u2018regional leader.\u2019 With financial and legal advice from CSFB and <italic>Sullivan Cromwell, Wachovia</italic> merged in 2001 with <italic>First Union</italic>, whose advisors included <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s Greg Fleming. Likewise, <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> bought the Eccles-dominated <italic>First Security</italic> BHC in 2000, becoming the largest bank in terms of deposits in New Mexico, Nevada, Idaho, and Utah.\nAnd as China and other countries allowed foreign investment to overhaul decrepit state-owned banks, refineries, phone networks, steel mills, and shipbuilders, <italic>McKinsey</italic> entered to guide multinationals. <italic>McKinsey</italic> alums also reshaped European exchanges and reinsurers. However, a central banker started the process. Born in 1943 at the family estate in Grocholin, Posen, R\u00fcdiger Rosen\u2019s mother led six children to the West in freezing temperatures. After earning a doctorate, Rosen focused on the central capital market committee. \nDuring his tenure at GBB, he served as an assistant to Karl Blessing\u2019s successor Karl P\u00f6hl, headed the President\u2019s office in 1980, and became the Press Chief in 1984. His career shifted when he left GBB in 1986 to reorganize and unify the fragmented German stock exchanges as the head of the management of <italic>Association of German Stock Exchanges</italic>. While he was appointed CEO of <italic>Frankfurt Stock Exchange</italic>, he struggled to unify the various divisions and failed to challenge the resistance of market makers on <italic>Frankfurt Stock Exchange</italic> to an electronic order-matching system.\nBy 1993, <italic>Deutsche B\u00f6rse</italic> was formed as a HC for <italic>Frankfurt Stock Exchange</italic> and other financial entities. Frankfurt was known for its technological advancement, settling trades within 48 hours, but faced challenges like an underdeveloped investor culture and inadequate regulation. <italic>Deutsche B\u00f6rse</italic> largest shareholders\u2014<italic>Commerzbank</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic> <italic>Morgan</italic> <italic>Grenfell</italic> and <italic>Dresdner Kleinwort</italic>\u2014appointing Werner Seifert as CEO to create a world-class operation that could help Frankfurt rival London for supremacy as a financial center. Without stock exchange experience, Swiss-born Seifert had a doctorate in business and political science from <italic>Uni of Hamburg</italic> and <italic>McKinsey</italic> experience since 1979. \nThree years after joining <italic>McKinsey</italic>, Seifert made Partner at the unusually young age of 33. Remained there until 1986, he left to join <italic>Swiss Re</italic>. As the <italic>Financial Markets Promotion Act of 1994 </italic>improved regulations, interest in investing grew. With the <italic>euro</italic>\u2019s introduction in 1999, mergers became prevalent, and <italic>Deutsche B\u00f6rse</italic> merged its settlement and clearing unit with <italic>Cedel</italic> to create <italic>Clearstream</italic>. While Seifert took <italic>Deutsche B\u00f6rse</italic> public in 2001 to acquire <italic>London Stock Exchange,</italic> he failed, but so did his successor. During his tenure, <italic>Deutsche B\u00f6rse</italic> became Europe\u2019s largest exchange, with the world\u2019s largest derivatives market, <italic>Eurex</italic>, and taking ownership of <italic>Clearstream</italic>. Without of a European giant, smaller rivals merged to create <italic>Euronext</italic>.\nLike other Swiss financial elites through most of the 20th century, Rainer Gut\u2019s directorates included <italic>Nestl\u00e9</italic>, <italic>Swiss Re</italic>, <italic>Ciba Geigy</italic>, BGGE, <italic>Pechiney</italic>, <italic>Union Carbide</italic>, and <italic>Daimler Benz</italic><italic>.</italic> However, the Swiss corporate network of interlocking directorates soon declined. Shifts in business strategies, such as reducing close ties and the arrival of foreign managers, altered the network\u2019s structure. Additionally, changes in global economics weakened Swiss shareholders\u2019 influence, while leading banks redirected focus towards more profitable markets, distancing themselves from industrial companies.\nThroughout the 1990s, <italic>Swiss Re</italic> concentrated on reinsurance, acquiring companies in the life and health reinsurance sectors, and exploring opportunities in the investment banking market. After Seifert left <italic>Swiss Re</italic>, Managing Director of <italic>McKinsey</italic> Switzerland Lukas M\u00fchlemann joined <italic>Swiss Re</italic> in 1994. By 1997, <italic>Lazard</italic>-alum Rainer Gut made M\u00fchlemann CEO of <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>, buying Swiss insurer <italic>Winterthur</italic>, <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s equity operations, and <italic>Garantia</italic>, one of Brazil\u2019s largest banks. \nWalter Kielholz, another <italic>McKinsey</italic> alum, took over as head of <italic>Swiss Re</italic>, soon buying <italic>Connecticut Life Re</italic>, thus creating the largest reinsurer in the world. Kielholz also joined <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s board. Likewise, <italic>McKinsey</italic> alum-turned-Vice Chair of <italic>American Express</italic> George Farr became the first American to join <italic>Swiss Re</italic>\u2019s board in 1996. After <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s James Gorman developed <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s Internet strategy for a decade, <italic>Merrill </italic>hired him to lead marketing against retail brokerage competition from 1999. \nSimilarly, <italic>McKinsey</italic> alums connected industry with investors outside of banking. After the Navy during WWII, Chicago-born Andrall Pearson finished <italic>Harvard Business</italic>. By 1954, he joined <italic>McKinsey</italic>, where he helped merge <italic>Pepsi</italic> with <italic>Frito-Lay</italic> in 1965. After 16 years with <italic>McKinsey</italic>, <italic>Pepsi</italic> hired Pearson as President by 1971. After 14 years with <italic>Pepsi</italic> and a stint as a <italic>Harvard Business </italic>professor, Pearson joined LBO firm <italic>Clayton</italic> <italic>Dubilier</italic> <italic>Rice</italic> in 1993, orchestrating the transformation of <italic>Pepsi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> fast-food businesses. By 1997, he became CEO and Chair of the resulting company, now known as <italic>Yum Brands</italic>. \nPearson hired over a dozen more <italic>McKinsey</italic> alumni for <italic>Pepsi</italic>, including Michael Jordan, who went on to run <italic>Westinghouse</italic>. Since Jordan expanded <italic>Pepsi</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>snack foods business overseas, he left for <italic>Clayton</italic> in 1992. However, <italic>Westinghouse</italic> recruited him within a year. Selling off most of the conglomerate\u2019s subsidiaries, Jordan recast the remaining media arm as CBS. By 1998, he became CEO of Ross Perot\u2019s EDS, which <italic>Hewlett-Packard </italic>bought within a decade. \nOther <italic>McKinsey</italic> alums reorganized companies ranging from fashion magazine powerhouse <italic>Cond\u00e9 Nast </italic>to sports broadcaster<italic> </italic>ESPN. Of these, Pamela Thomas broke a glass ceiling at <italic>McKinsey</italic>. The combination of New Deal era democratic socialism and white flight from Detroit privileged the Thomas family with rare stability after they graduated <italic>South Carolina State Uni</italic>. Born in South Carolina, Albert Thomas participant in the desegregated Army during the <italic>Korean War</italic>, before joining the Detroit municipal government, where he remained for 44 years, finishing as Deputy Director of Buildings & Safety Engineering Department. His Georgia-born wife, Marian spent 37-years with Michigan\u2019s Health & Human Services culminated as District Office Manager. Throughout, the couple prioritized their Presbyterian faith and the Democrat party politics.\nAffirmative action also helped their daughter, Pamela graduate <italic>Harvard</italic>, <italic>Harvard</italic> Business, and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law by the age of 26 in 1989. Joining <italic>McKinsey</italic>, she became the first female Black partner by 1995 at 32. Resigning in 1999, Pamela joined GE\u2019s NBC as President of CNBC.com. By 2001, she became CEO of CNBC cable TV until 2005, when she left to lead <italic>Liz Claiborne</italic>. (Since <italic>McKinsey</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> first Black female hire, <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic> Business graduate Jacqueline Bradley joined in 1982, she left for finance roles within two years, rising to SVP of Florida\u2019s <italic>SunTrust Bank</italic> and directing <italic>Tampa Electric Co</italic> and other boards.)\nMeanwhile, French finance revitalized as socialism went into remission. As French socialists lost power in 1986, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris finally gained a banking license. That year, Amschel Rothschild, after a decade as a circulation manager for literary magazine, entered the family business, and became head of Asset Management two years later. That year, Hugo Kindersley, the third Lord Kindersley, left <italic>Lazard</italic> London to chair British <italic>Brent Walker</italic>. David Verey, son of former <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> Chair Michael Verey, became head of <italic>Lazard</italic> London<italic> </italic>after being with the firm since 1972.<italic> </italic>By 1991, <italic>Barclay</italic> bought <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris bank. \nFollowing French bank nationalization in 1982, former <italic>Credit Agricole</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> banker Jacques Mayoux joined the foreign service until <italic>Goldman</italic> recruited him in 1986. <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris no longer led French M&A. Since France reprivatized <italic>Paribas</italic> in 1987, deposit banking operations loss grew until the bank divested areas to focus on corporate and financial banking in 1994.\nWhile the need for liquidity drove <italic>Indochine</italic> <italic>Suez</italic> to sell the fourth largest British asset manager and <italic>Indochine</italic>\u2019s old Hong Kong branch, <italic>Lyonnaise</italic> sold her Latin American subsidiaries in 1996. Since <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris<italic> </italic>formed a derivatives JV with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</italic> in 1994, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</italic> hired<italic> Goldman</italic>\u2019s Mayoux to buy <italic>Indochine</italic> <italic>Suez</italic> in 1996. While <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Jean-Marie Messier launched France\u2019s first LBO in 1989, dealmaking only grew with the return of a right-wing government in 1993. Along with a trove of deals, Messier helped <italic>Lazard</italic> privatize BNP by 1996. When Vincent Bollor\u00e9\u2014son of Bernheim\u2019s high school friend\u2019s Michel Bollor\u00e9 and a Goldschmidt heiress\u2014sold several of his group\u2019s divisions in 1994, including <italic>Frans</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 <italic>Gaz & Eau</italic> and Messier\u2019s LBO financed <italic>Frans</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> </italic>MBO. \n<italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 power also grew with the fortunes of cousins outside of the firm. A grandson of Clotilde Lazard, Edmond Alphand\u00e9ry served as Deputy for Maine-et-Loire from 1978 and Mayor of Longu\u00e9-Jumelles from 1977. While he became a VP of the political <italic>Centre des D\u00e9mocrates Sociaux</italic> from 1989, he joined insurers controlled by his Lazard cousins, becoming President of <italic>Caisse Nationale de Pr\u00e9voyance</italic> and VP of CNP-<italic>Assurances</italic>\u2019 Board. In 1993, he returned became Minister of the Economy under President Edouard Balladur until 1995, when joined <italic>\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France</italic> as President in 1995.\nBut as Michel Weill\u2019s son-in-law, Eduardo Stern, joined <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in 1994, Messier saw his chances at leading <italic>Lazard</italic> vanish, and left to head what became <italic>Vivendi Universal</italic>. Born lower-middle class in Orleans, Anne Lauvergeon attended a provincial lycee before graduating from the prestigious <italic>Ecole des Mines</italic> and <italic>Ecole Normale Superieure</italic>. She served at the <italic>Elysee Palace</italic> under President Mitterrand as <italic>Advisor for Economic International Affairs</italic> from 1991 until 1994, when Stern hired her as <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 only female partner, making four in all <italic>Lazard</italic>. \nBy 1996, likely with the aid of Michel, the newly privatized French aluminum giant, <italic>Pechiney</italic>, invited Lauvergeon to the company\u2019s board. Stern grew furious for he had been <italic>Pechiney</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> adviser, and thought he deserved the seat. As he fired Lauvergeon in late 1996, his relationship with his father-in-law deteriorated. Lauvergeon\u2019s career, however, improved as she became Senior Executive VP at <italic>Alcatel</italic> <italic>Telecom</italic> in 1997, Chair and CEO of <italic>Cogema</italic> in 1999, and then Chair and CEO of nuclear generator <italic>Areva</italic>.\nAlthough <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris\u2019 Bernheim allowed LVMH\u2019s Bernard Arnault to win the takeover of <italic>Boussac</italic> in 1984 over the larger <italic>Bidermann</italic>, who owned the licenses for <italic>Yves Saint Laurent</italic>, <italic>Calvin Klein</italic>, <italic>Ralph Lauren</italic>, and other designers. While<italic> Lazard</italic> advised on the restructuring of Paris-based <italic>Bidermann</italic> in 1995, it was <italic>Goldman</italic> who bought a third of <italic>Ralph Lauren</italic> in 1994 and took the company public in New York by 1997. Through all the disruption, however, Lazard-Wertheim descendants continued to privately own <italic>Chanel</italic> in Paris.\n<italic>Lazard</italic> led privatization by partnering with local elites. Since India\u2019s <italic>State Bank of India</italic> grew merchant banking services from 1985, Udayan Bose became Chair of a new a joint-venture with <italic>Lazard</italic> London forming India\u2019s first multinational investment bank, <italic>Credit Capital </italic>(\u201c<italic>Lazard</italic> India\u201d), after holding key positions in Asia-Pacific with <italic>Grindlay</italic> and <italic>Deutsche.</italic> While Bose chaired <italic>Kolkata Stock Exchange</italic> to modernize and attract foreign investors, he also made deals, advising on Marwari R.P. Goenka\u2019s acquisition of HMV. By 1993, Bose co-founded of <italic>Indian VC Association</italic> with government-financed entities. As SEBI introduced guidelines for VC firms in India spurred investment, <italic>Draper</italic> was among the earliest in 1996. \nSince co-founding <italic>Industrial Credit & Investment Corp of India</italic> (\u201cICICI\u201d) in 1955 with <italic>BANK</italic> and IMF, the newly independent Indian government became ICICI\u2019s primary funding source. However, economic reforms in the early 1990s compelled ICICI to seek international capital. Concurrently, the bank diversified by forming strategic partnerships, such as the ICICI <italic>Securities & Finance </italic>JV with <italic>Morgan </italic>in 1994. While <italic>Harvard</italic> Business graduate Naina Lal Kidwai helped organize the JV, she left to be Vice Chair & MD of HSBC <italic>Securities & Capital Markets </italic>in India. \nOther women also prospered. Lalita Gupte served as ICICI\u2019s Joint Managing Director, becoming the first woman on its board in 1994. As Chanda Kochhar became ICICI\u2019s Executive Director from 2001, Renuka Ramnath led ICICI <italic>Ventures</italic>, and Shikha Sharma was CEO of ICICI <italic>Prudential </italic>LIC. Kalpana Morparia rose to Executive Director, she left to be CEO of <italic>Morgan </italic>India by 2007. And outside of ICICI, Kishori Udeshi served as Deputy Governor of the <italic>Reserve Bank of India</italic> from 2003.\nBy 1987, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s emerging markets practice hired Filipino Vincent Perez, who started his first job with <italic>Mellon Bank</italic> in 1983. Transferring to New York, he became the first Asian to make Partner at<italic> Lazard</italic>. His deals included debt-for-nature swap conservation deals for an underground river in Palawan and coral reefs in El Nido. He resigned by 1996 to start an Asian-focused LBO. (Likewise, V-Nee Yeh left <italic>Lazard</italic> London in 1994 after six years to direct another Asian fund.) While <italic>Lazard</italic> created a JV with Poland\u2019s state-owned <italic>Handlowy </italic>in 1995, Poland privatized <italic>Handlowy </italic>in 1997, and <italic>Morgan </italic>acquired nearly a quarter of the shares by 1998. Failing to acquire smaller rivals, <italic>Citi</italic> bought <italic>Handlowy </italic>after a bidding war in 2000. \nIn Russia, with royal and KGB roots, <italic>Energy Minister </italic>Vladimir Lopukhin advocated breaking up Soviet energy into vertical integrated competitors. After Russia hired <italic>Lazard</italic> to raise foreign debt, Yeltsin sought to privatize SOEs into units, and so replaced Lopukhin in 1992 and named former Soviet Gas Minister Minster Viktor Chernomyrdin as PM. As Yeltsin allowed him to create an integrated gas monopoly, Lopukhin formed <italic>Lazard</italic> Moscow to create <italic>Gazprom </italic>with Chernomyrdin as Chair. \nAfter Italy formed development bank IMI in 1931, Alberto Beneduce and his son-in-law, Enrico Cuccia, organized <italic>MedioBanca</italic> and deposited shares with allies, including Beneduce\u2019s <italic>Banca Commerciale Italiana</italic> (\u201cBCI\u201d), <italic>Banco di Roma</italic>, and <italic>Generali</italic>. Selling some equity to <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1955, <italic>MedioBanca</italic> split control of <italic>Generali </italic>with <italic>Lazard</italic> by 1973. In 1989, <italic>MedioBanca</italic> invested in BCI. Enrico Braggiotti, the recent Chair of BCI, was born in Turkey 1923 to a <italic>TURK</italic> director. While his family moved to Monaco shortly after, he spent his career internationally with BCI. By 1990, Enrico left to lead a bank in Monaco, which BCI bought by 1996. As part of the transaction, Enrico Braggiotti\u2019s son, Gerardo, joined <italic>MedioBanca</italic>. \nFrom 1990, Italy began separating Medieval-era banking from charitable foundations, with tax incentives to expand into private-sector activities. <italic>Sanpaolo</italic> established as a joint-stock corporation in 1992 and privatized in 1997. Likewise, new Italian banking legislation of 1993 brought increased competition to <italic>MedioBanca</italic> and corporations sought alternative financing. While remaining a <italic>Lazard</italic> director, Antoine Bernheim chaired Italy\u2019s largest insurer, <italic>Generali</italic>, from 1995. That year, Gerardo Braggiotti rose to <italic>MedioBanca</italic>\u2019s second in command. \nIn 1996, <italic>United Steelworker</italic> hired <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Ron Boom, where he worked under union specialist Keilin to reorg. Like the members of labor unions, leadership dynasties continued with the ascension of James Hoffa Jr as the head of <italic>International Brotherhood of Teamsters</italic>. As oil prices fell in 1997, a substantial transformation reshaped the international oil industry, marking its most significant change since 1911. \nThis transformation resulted from a series of mergers that created larger, more efficient, and globally expanded entities referred to as \u2018supermajors.\u2019 Despite concerns, regulatory authorities permitted the merger of <italic>Exxon</italic> and <italic>Mobil</italic> in 1999, subject to divestitures, given their relatively small market share compared to the <italic>OIL</italic>. This shift in the industry landscape had noteworthy impacts on oil prices and politics, particularly during America\u2019s 2000 Presidential Campaign. From May 1999, gold prices fell as Britain decided to sell half her gold supply to build reserves of <italic>dollars</italic>, <italic>euros</italic>, and <italic>yen </italic>after the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>. \nThe human tolls of socialite banking on families can only be guessed. Failings led head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Asset Management Amschel Rothschild to commit suicide in 1996. As tension grew with his son-in-law, Weill\u2019s <italic>Gaz</italic> seeded Stern\u2019s LBO to make him leave in 1997. Within weeks, Stern and Beatrice divorced. Since spinning off <italic>Pearson</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s David Verey refused to leave Weill\u2019s <italic>Lazard</italic> to head <italic>Pearson</italic>. \nSo,<italic> Lazard</italic> London promoted the first female CEO of the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>\u2019s hundred largest firms, with American-born Marjorie Scardino leading <italic>Pearson</italic> from 1997. The same year, Rohatyn, left <italic>Lazard</italic> to represent the Clinton Administration in France. By then, Felix\u2019s son Nicholas was the youngest member of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s strategy group, heading the emerging markets, FX, and commodities groups, and soon establishing offices in Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Russia, Korea, and India.\nBy 1998, <italic>AXA Insurance</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Assurances Generates de France </italic>(\u201cAGF\u201d),<italic> </italic>and LVMH launched LBO funds. By then, investment banks fought family-owned private insurers. BNP formed an alliance with France\u2019s largest insurer, <italic>Union des Assurances de Paris</italic>, in 1989. The same year, French AXA outbid Italy\u2019s <italic>Generali</italic> for <italic>Co du Midi</italic>, and <italic>Paribas</italic> raising her investment in AXA to nearly 30% by 1992. \nLikewise, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> of Cologne sold her stake in <italic>Colonia</italic> to a French group in 1989 and restructured as a limited partnership with family ownership. In 1994, American <italic>General</italic> Re acquired a majority stake in <italic>Cologne</italic> Re, <italic>Colonia</italic>\u2019s reinsurance subsidiary. As <italic>Generali</italic>\u2019s Bernheim improved relations with AXA in 1996, <italic>Union des Assurances de Paris </italic>merged with AXA, forming AXA <italic>Colonia</italic> by 1997. After one of Maurice Greenberg\u2019s sons left AIG to lead capital markets for insurance broker <italic>Marsh</italic>, his brother became heir apparent to his father Maurice.\nAs more investment banks entered Italy, Gerardo Braggiotti sought to merge with <italic>Lazard</italic>. But as Cuccia blocked him in 1997, Gerardo defected to <italic>Lazard</italic> as the head of Europe outside of England and France by 1998. Weill also hired Steven Rattner as Deputy Chair, exacerbating with Vice Chair Kendrick Wilson and other partners. To resolve power dynamics within the firm, Weill and Rattner hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> to mediate. However, Rattner soon left with three partners to start <italic>Quadrangle</italic> LBO. So did <italic>Lazard</italic> Chicago\u2019s Ira Harris, to join a Pritzker fund. Soon after, Wilson left to lead the financial institutions group at <italic>Goldman</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> bought <italic>Hambro</italic> in 1997, BNP borrowed from <italic>Goldman</italic> in hostile bids for <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> and <italic>Paribas</italic> before taking over <italic>Paribas</italic>, to form BNP <italic>Paribas</italic>. Defensively, <italic>Sanpaolo</italic> and IMI merged to create Italy\u2019s largest bank. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, <italic>Allianz</italic> formed a LIC in China through a JV <italic>Dazhong</italic> and acquired several LICs in Korea to establish <italic>Hana</italic>. And as <italic>Allianz</italic> initiated the acquisition of AGF, <italic>Generali</italic> launched a hostile takeover of AGF. With AGF hiring<italic> Goldman</italic>\u2019s Mayoux for advice, protracted negotiations ensued, leading to a resolution in May 1997, where <italic>Allianz</italic> acquired AGF while conceding control of <italic>Aachener M\u00fcnchener Beteiligungs </italic>(\u201cAMB\u201d), Germany\u2019s third-largest insurer to <italic>Generali</italic>. In 1998, <italic>Generali</italic> capitalized on this agreement, gaining majority control of AMB and acquiring three AGF subsidiaries. Additionally, <italic>Generali</italic> formed a strategic alliance with <italic>Commerzbank</italic>, Germany\u2019s fourth-largest bank.\nIn 1998, former <italic>McKinsey</italic> consultant Alessandro Profumo merged <italic>Credito Italiano</italic> Italy\u2019s 6th largest banks into the 8th largest, <italic>Unicredit</italic>, along with seven regional banks, to become Italy\u2019s second-largest bank. To protect <italic>MedioBanca</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> independence against hostile takeovers, Cuccia sought to merge <italic>Banca di Roma</italic> with BCI. But as Gerardo Braggiotti advised <italic>Unicredit</italic> to acquire BCI, the fourth-largest bank, <italic>San Paolo</italic> IMI proposed to buy <italic>Banca di Roma</italic>, the fifth-largest bank. So, Cuccia brought in <italic>Banca Intesa </italic>as a white knight for BCI and ousted Bernheim from <italic>Generali</italic> in 1999 to control BCI shares and <italic>MedioBanca</italic> shares<italic>.</italic> Afterward, <italic>Unicredit</italic> looked outside Italy, buying Poland\u2019s state-owned <italic>Pekao</italic> and the largest Bulgarian and Czech banks, <italic>Bulbank </italic>and <italic>Zivnostenska</italic>. \nIn 1999, to separate Weill family assets from other <italic>Lazard</italic> partners, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</italic> bought 30% of <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s HC, Weill renamed <italic>Gaz</italic> into <italic>Azeo</italic> (putting <italic>Generali</italic> interests into <italic>Eurafrance</italic>), and cut ties with <italic>Pearson</italic>. Since turning down <italic>Pearson</italic> in 1997, Verey resigned in 2000 as Weill reorganized <italic>Lazard</italic> to bring together the Paris, London, and New York houses. Weill replaced Chair of <italic>Lazard</italic> London Verey with Marcus Agius. Since Maltese Agius joined <italic>Vickers</italic> in 1968, plc before marrying Kate Rothschild, a Katz-cousin descended from Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, in 1971. Becoming a cousin-in-law of the Huths through the Rothschilds, Agius was hired by <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Poole in 1972, along with Verey.\nWith the rise of global investment banks traditional British merchant banks declined. Since Dutch ING took over what remained of <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Warburg</italic> London, and <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic> were taken over respectably by <italic>Swiss Bank Corp </italic>and <italic>Dresdner Bank</italic>. <italic>Citi</italic> acquired <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s investment banking division in January 2000, <italic>Chase</italic> purchased <italic>Fleming</italic> in April. Only <italic>Lazard</italic> London and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London remained independent from the top ten City merchant banks of 1983, before PM Thatcher deregulated the sector with <italic>Big Bang</italic> of 1986. Among the bankers to remain British, <italic>Hill Samuel</italic> sold herself to <italic>Trustee Savings Bank</italic> (\u201cTSB\u201d) after the Scottish depositor-owned bank floated her shares. Smyth-in-law Nicholas Goodison soon became her Chair, stepping down to Deputy Chair  after selling TSB to <italic>Lloyd</italic> in 1995.\nAgius soon advised <italic>Halifax</italic> on her merger with <italic>Bank of Scotland</italic> in 2001 to form HBOS, and power moved to the Yorkshire-based <italic>Halifax</italic>.<italic> Bank of Scotland</italic>\u2019s Peter Burt, an establishment figure, whose father managed operations for the Earl of Inchcape, who later acquired P&O <italic>Shipping</italic> with <italic>Lazard</italic> London. <italic>Bank of Scotland</italic>\u2019s main rival, <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland </italic>(\u201cRBS\u201d) pursued a different path. \nLed by non-elite George Mathewson and Fred Goodwin. Like Mathewson washed away elitism in Britain, he further chipped away at the Boston Brahmin, buying commercial banks from Boston-based <italic>State Street</italic> and <italic>UST Corp</italic>. As he grew <italic>Citizens Financial </italic>from New England\u2019s fifth-largest bank in in 1988 into the third largest by 1996, Mathewson hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> to centralize operations. After failing to take over the larger <italic>Barclay</italic> in 1999, RBS bought <italic>NatWest</italic> by 2000. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Barclay</italic> reinforced elite relations. A grandnephew of <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Robert Brand, Robert Fellowes joined the London discount broker <italic>Allen Harvey Ross</italic> in the 1960s and became a director until he entered the Royal Household in 1977 as Assistant Private Secretary to Queen Elizabeth. After he married Cynthia Spencer\u2014whose ancestors include Francis Baring\u2014in 1978, Cynthia\u2019s sister Diana married the Crown Prince in 1981. Fellowes was promoted to Deputy Private Secretary in 1986 and to Private Secretary in 1990 but retired after Diana died in 1996, and became Chair of <italic>Barclay</italic> Private Bank.\nAfter buying <italic>Salomon</italic> in late 1997, Sanford Weill\u2019s <italic>Smith Barney</italic> merged with <italic>Citi</italic> against FA1933, creating a \u2018global financial supermarket\u2019 in 1998. As American bank market share of credit shrank, FRS increased the amount of revenues banks could derive from investment banking, and FDIC called for the repeal of FA1933. By November, Congress enacted the <italic>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act </italic>(\u201cFA1999\u201d). Unlike the acts up to  that limited BHC activities, the new legislation allowed FHCs that could invest in securities broker-dealer, insurance, VC, LBO, and other financial activities. As FRS required reserves for BHC-issued CP since August, FA1999 limited nonbank activities. While regulations dissuaded banking investment in VC and LBOs,  minorities thrived as bank mergers grew.\nAfter Jamie Dimon left <italic>Citi</italic> in November 1998, Victor Menezes President of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s bank unit and joint CEO of the corporate and investment bank,<italic> Salomon Smith Barney</italic>. Menezes, was born in Pune to Goa descendants of aristocratic Portuguese colonists. His father had  served as General Manager of <italic>Southeastern</italic> RR, Secretary of Defense Production, and Chair of the Railway Board. Victor graduated from IIT Bombay in 1970 and received a master\u2019s degree from MIT in 1972. He joined <italic>Citi</italic> the same year and held roles in India, South Asia, Hong Kong, China, Latin America, and Africa. He joined <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Policy Committee in 1985 and became EVP in 1989, overseeing European consumer operations. \nVictor\u2019s brother Ivan, studied at IIM Ahmedabad and in 1985. He joined <italic>Nestl\u00e9</italic> in 1981 and, after earning an MBA at <italic>Northwestern Uni</italic>, worked at <italic>Booz Allen</italic>. From 1992, he served as group marketing VP at <italic>Whirlpool</italic> in Italy. In 1997, he became strategy director at <italic>Guinness</italic> during her merger with <italic>Grand Metropolitan</italic>, which formed <italic>Diageo</italic>. In 1998, he was named global marketing director. He later became president of North America and COO, and, in 2013, CEO.\nBy 2000, <italic>Morgan </italic>merged with <italic>Chemical</italic> <italic>Chase</italic> and Dina Dublon ascended to CFO, becoming one of the most powerful women on Wall Street. The same year, Peter Karches, a 25-year veteran at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, was ousted by CEO Phil Purcell, and Vikram Pandit assumed his role as co-Head of <italic>Institutional Securities</italic> in charge of 15,000 people and over 60% of firm profits. While Raymond McGuire left <italic>Merrill</italic> to join Perella at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> as global co-head of M&A, Stanley O\u2019Neal won the CEO succession race of <italic>Merrill</italic> in 2001 to become the most prominent Black on Wall Street and elevated Zakaria to co-Head of <italic>Global Markets & Investment Banking</italic>, responsible for 60% of the firm\u2019s revenues. \nThis leadership trend continued with Bayo Ogunlesi at CSFB, who oversaw over 25,000 bankers collectively with Pandit and Zakaria. These leaders, in charge of the most profitable divisions, recruited like-minded trusted lieutenants, exemplified by individuals such as Tarek Abdel-Meguid, whose father hails from Egypt, reporting to Pandit, and Ahmass Fakahany from Egypt and Dow Kim from Korea reporting to Zakaria. \nWhile <italic>Lazard</italic>-alum Rainer Gut stepped down as Chair of <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> in 2000,<italic> McKinsey</italic> Switzerland alum Lukas M\u00fchlemann took his place and negotiated with Hamilton James to buy <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, </italic>becoming the World\u2019s largest HYB underwriter. By 2001, M\u00fchlemann hired the newly ousted John Mack to lead Investment Banking at CSFB. Although Mack tried to recruit his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Zoe Cruz, she worried about conflicts of interest as her husband was Head of <italic>Equity Capital Markets</italic> at CSFB, and so remained loyal to <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> despite a rocky relationship with Pandit. Almost immediately, Mack sought to oust the powerful Quattrone. While Mack waited for his opportunity, lack of heirs and politics redefined <italic>Lazard</italic>.\nAs Bernheim felt slighted that Weill, did not protect him against <italic>MedioBanca</italic>, Vincent Bollor\u00e9 likened <italic>Lazard</italic> Partners to Insull\u2019s PUIHCs in a hostile takeover. However, he did not win over Bernheim. With the death of Enrico Cuccia in 2000, Bernheim returned as Chair of <italic>Generali</italic> until two years before his death in 2012. Instead, Weill merged his family\u2019s <italic>Eurafrance</italic> and <italic>Azeo</italic> into <italic>Eurazeo</italic>, in 2001 under the chairmanship of Patrick Sayer. Within a year, <italic>Eurazeo</italic> sold her <italic>Generali</italic> shares for over \u20ac900 million. \nWhile Weill sought to sell <italic>Lazard</italic>, Germany\u2019s <italic>Dresdner Kleinwort</italic> bought <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic> September 2000, promoting Ashish Bhutani to head of <italic>Dresdner </italic>America. He worked under Manjit Boual was born in India into a Sikh family before moving to Britain as a child. After graduating <italic>Bristol</italic> <italic>Uni</italic>, she joined <italic>Cooper Lybrand</italic> and then moved to <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic>. Working on the privatization of regional PUs and telecoms, she became COO of <italic>Dresdner Kleinwort </italic>in 1999 and later co-head of investment banking. (Following <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Marjorie Scardino at <italic>Pearson</italic>, Boual became the first non-White female CEO of the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>\u2019s hundred largest companies as Chair of <italic>Provident Financial</italic> in 2014.)\nAfter buying PIMCO asset management from California-based <italic>Pacific</italic> LIC in 2000, <italic>Allianz</italic> bought <italic>Dresdner</italic> <italic>Kleinwort</italic> <italic>Wasserstein </italic>in April 2001, offering a <italic>Citi</italic>-like panoply of services. After failing to sell <italic>Lazard</italic>, Weill reorganized <italic>Lazard</italic> and hired Bruce Wasserstein from <italic>Allianz</italic> as senior partner to run <italic>Lazard </italic>in 2002. While remaining Chair, Michel gave authority on hiring, firing, and pay, selling him a 1% stake in <italic>Lazard</italic> for $30M with another 7% for free. \nBefore Wasserstein appointed Ashish Bhutani to head <italic>Lazard</italic> Asset Management, Weill left to grow <italic>Eurazeo</italic>. But KKR dominated European LBOs. Along with joining French steelworks <italic>Wendel</italic> to buyout <italic>Legrand</italic> from<italic> Schneider</italic> in 2002, they added seven <italic>Siemens</italic> subsidiaries. In Germany, <italic>Dresdner</italic> joined with <italic>Deutsche</italic> and <italic>Commerzbank</italic> to pool mortgage operations in 2001. For this initiative, <italic>Commerzbank</italic> added Martin Blessing to her board. A grandson of GBB\u2019s first President and son of a <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> board member, Blessing joined <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Frankfurt and New York offices and became a partner by 31 before leaving for finance two years later in 1996.\nAmong her multi-directional expansion, <italic>Citi</italic> bought Poland\u2019s <italic>Handlowy </italic>after a bidding war in 2000. The same year, <italic>Citi</italic> bought<italic> Schr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s investment banking division. By 2001, <italic>Citi</italic> bought <italic>Banamex</italic> from <italic>Helu</italic> after BBVA bought <italic>Bancomer</italic>. By 2002, after transforming Italy\u2019s postal system, <italic>McKinsey</italic> consultant Corrado Passera joined <italic>Intesa</italic> BCI to integrate operations. Shortly after <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</italic> phase out their derivatives joint venture in 2003 due to \u2018market conditions, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</italic> bought <italic>Lyonnais</italic>. By 2006, <italic>Sanpaolo</italic> IMI merged with <italic>Intesa</italic> BCI under <italic>McKinsey</italic> alum Corrado Passera\u2019s leadership. \nAfter Japanese rate hikes during the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>, the <italic>Diet</italic> demonetized land by reforming bankruptcy, FA1933-like laws, pro-cartel bank interest rate controls, and tax laws on bank land-collateralized loans and bad loan accounting by 1994. By 1997, Japanese investment banks <italic>Sanyo Securities</italic> and <italic>Yamaichi</italic> filed for bankruptcy. \nWhile <italic>Nikko</italic> entered a JV with <italic>Salomon Smith Barney</italic> that was tantamount to a takeover, <italic>Allianz</italic> formed a LIC in China through a JV <italic>Dazhong</italic> and acquired several Korean LICs and formed <italic>Hana</italic> LIC. Likewise, <italic>Nomura</italic> and <italic>Daiwa</italic> allied with <italic>Industrial Bank of Japan</italic> and <italic>Sumitomo Bank</italic>, while continuing to lose market share. Since Japan\u2019s <italic>Nikko </italic>bought a 20% interest in <italic>Blackstone</italic>, Sandy Weill\u2019s <italic>Smith Barney</italic> partnered with <italic>Nikko</italic>, leading AIG\u2019s Maurice Greenberg to acquire 7% of <italic>Blackstone</italic> in 1998 before <italic>Blackstone</italic> repurchased <italic>Nikko</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> stake.\nJapan\u2019s steel cartel collapsed as a Korean conglomerate fire sold steel during the <italic>Asian Crisis</italic>. Despite Congress guaranteed loans, American to steel distributors failed as banks refused to lend. Amidst the international disarray, investors ran to LBOs and California\u2019s platform and telecom VC boom. While <italic>Berkshire </italic>sold <italic>Salomon</italic> to Sanford Weill\u2019s <italic>Smith Barney</italic> in 1997\u2014before the FA1999 boom\u2014she made her first PU investment in 1999 as investors ran to startups. \nIn 1998, Congress further supported the internet platform boom by codifying the Court\u2019s old decision prohibiting states from discriminatory taxes on out-of-state sales. So, consumers avoided state sales taxes online. Since the startups had heavy intangibles, they were poor candidates for conventional court-approved bankruptcies. \nInstead, VCs preferred liquidation using the Bay Area\u2019s unique assignments for the benefit of creditors (\u201cABC\u201d) process. As ABCs were less regulated than bankruptcy, they were faster and with less stigma. While this reassured senior investors, inside trade creditors\u2014such as other startups\u2014had lower priority. So, mergers helped protect credit. However, UST decried the potential for abusing small business loan securitization rather than issuing guidelines in early 2000. As a result, startup financing fell after March. \nTo reduce energy costs in 1996, California forced PUs to sell off electricity generating assets and abandon long-term contracts in favor of open-market spot purchases. While the collapse of oil prices during the East Asian <italic>Panic of 1997 </italic>assisted California\u2019s market. Despite BA1994, Puerto Rico could not approve municipal bankruptcy inexplicably since BA1984. \nMore so than on the mainland, FDR\u2019s Congress pushed through the <italic>Puerto Rico Power Authority</italic> (\u201cPRPA\u201d) to monopolize hydroelectricity. At the start of the <italic>Cold War</italic>, TA1954 and subsequent laws turned Puerto Rico into a corporate tax haven. Growing into America\u2019s largest PU, PRPA focused on oil refining from the 1960s. As the TA1976 spurred earnings repatriation after <italic>Panic of 1974</italic>, Puerto Rico negated it with taxes. From 1996, Congress phased Puerto Rico\u2019s tax haven benefits over a decade. But with PA1992, <italic>Enron</italic> expanded natural gas into Puerto Rico and sought to develop offshore gas by 1997. \nGlobal PU and telecom privatization accelerated with PA1992 and <italic>BANK</italic> aid. Since expropriating SGE\u2019s PUs in the 1940s, Argentina sold PUs to American PUs and pegged her <italic>peso</italic> to the <italic>dollar </italic>in 1991. As <italic>Enron</italic> rushed into India after her 1991 energy reform, R.P. Goenka, a Marwari businessman, took over <italic>Calcutta Electric Supply Corp </italic>(\u201cCESC\u201d) with help from the government. He quietly acquired 12% of CESC\u2019s equity and the Marxist government of West Bengal helped him acquire the rest of the shares needed for the takeover. Likewise, Malaysia and Indonesia sold public assets to politicos without competitive bids. By 1996, <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic> advised American PUs on three British PU buyouts. \nLike countries turned to <italic>BANK</italic> after BCCI fell, the fugitive <italic>Rich</italic> commodities in Switzerland formed <italic>Glencore</italic> via a management LBO in 1993. Only in 2001 did President Clinton pardon Marc Rich on his last day. Splitting from <italic>Rich</italic> with other senior partners, Schlumberger descendant Baron Eric T\u00fcrckheim founded <italic>Trafigura</italic> with funding from his former employer, BNP <italic>Paribas</italic>.\nAs moved <italic>Enron</italic> into Italy and the Nordic countries, Ken Lay pressed for deregulation in the European Union. Since launching <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s capital and trading division, former <italic>McKinsey</italic> consultant Jeffrey Skilling became <italic>Enron</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> President and COO. However, he faced competition for to succeed Lay as Chair from Rebecca Mark. Vice Chair Mark had renegotiated <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s Indian project with India\u2019s Hindu nationalists and headed <italic>Enron</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> push in the water industry.\nBut as much energy in India\u2019s <italic>Enron </italic>PU was stolen, losses grew as oil prices recovered by 1999. As Clinton released the <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</italic>, prices climbed through 2001. With unprecedented price volatility, President Bush Jr\u2019s energy task force concluded that Iraq\u2019s warmongering had to end to secure energy. Under higher oil prices and explosive demand from startups around the Bay Area, California\u2019s legislation squeezed PUs. PUs had to buy energy on the market but shield customers from price changes. Meanwhile, <italic>Enron</italic> and other traders bought energy where it was cheap and sold where it was expensive. <italic>Perot Systems</italic> sold software to profit across thousands of inter-state tax loopholes to<italic> Enron</italic>, <italic>El Paso Corp</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, the municipal <italic>Los Angeles Power & Water</italic>, and others with fixed energy contracts that could curb production. As insolvent PUs\u2014including PG&E\u2014stopped subsidizing electricity rates and filed for bankruptcy in 2001, consumer energy prices soared until the state capped rates. \nSince <italic>Northern States</italic> PUHC (\u201cNSP\u201d) hired former DOE regulator Hazel O\u2019Leary in 1989 to oversee legal and personnel departments, environmental affairs, public relations, and lobbying, President-elect Clinton appointed her the first woman and Black to lead DOE in 1992. As NSP planned to merge with <italic>New Century</italic> PUHC (\u201cNCE\u201d) in anticipation of deregulation in 1999. This merger required approval from different states and FERC. The combined company became one of the nation\u2019s largest. NCE was rapidly growing its basic utility business, while NSP excelled in deregulated services. NSP\u2019s subsidiary, NRG, became a significant source of earnings and expanded its global operations. In 2000, NRG had a successful IPO, and NSP merged with NCE to form <italic>Xcel</italic> PUHC. By 2001, <italic>Xcel</italic> received approval to build a line connecting Colorado to the eastern grid. \nCreditors sold risky assets to <italic>special purpose vehicles</italic> (\u201cSPVs\u201d) funded by <italic>asset-backed</italic> CP (\u201cABCP\u201d). But non-true sales plagued SPVs\u2014like airlines during the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>\u2014as creditors promised minimum returns and retained recourse. Few consolidated reporting as appropriate. While <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s domestic trading was profitable, the international disarray required significant write-downs in her foreign investments. To reduce debt and financing expenses, they moved these and other assets to off-balance-sheet SPVs. Since <italic>Enron</italic> did not hold majority voting interests in the SPVs, FASB and SEC allowed nonrecourse treatment without requiring consolidated reporting. \nHowever, <italic>Enron</italic> used derivatives\u2014instead of taxable loans or sales\u2014to structure SPV transactions. With <italic>Citi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> assistance, derivatives converted the off-balance-sheet debt into recourse debt. Furthermore, <italic>Enron</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s </italic>mark-to-market accounting used opaque model estimates to value illiquid trading positions and SPVs. After <italic>Enron</italic> failed to sell her Indian and other international PUs to the Sheik of UAE due to the latter\u2019s health issues in late 2000, investors ran as Jim Chanos and other short sellers publicized the SPVs. By early 2001, a court avoided liquidating <italic>LTV Steel</italic> by applying the automatic stay and treating ABCP as secured loans. As ABCP markets seized up, Congress moved to amend BA1993 but was forced to stop. \nThrough the 1980s, BCCI, along with two Saudi banks, channeled funds from wealthy Arabs and CIA to support the mujahideen in Afghanistan during the <italic>Afghan-Soviet War</italic> of the 1980s. While the collapse of BCCI hurt Osama bin Laden\u2019s early terrorist financing, he continued funding Islamist radical movements against liberal across the Middle East and beyond. Even after losing Saudi citizenship, he used <italic>Saudi</italic> <italic>National Commercial Bank</italic> of Saudi Arabia to transfer funds for various activities. When bin Laden\u2019s 9/11 terrorist attacks disrupted America\u2019s financial and airline system, both of which UST bailed out. \nAfter <italic>Enron</italic> retained <italic>Weil Gotshal</italic> in October 2001, SEC required <italic>Enron </italic>to restate prior years\u2019 statements, leading investors run by December 2001. Filing for bankruptcy under counsel of <italic>Weil Gotshal</italic>, <italic>Enron </italic>wiped out ESOP and worsened ABCP runs. <italic>Enron</italic> used the Nebraska-based <italic>InterNorth</italic> pipe\u2014which formed <italic>Enron</italic> in 1985\u2014as loan collateral from<italic> Dynegy</italic>. While <italic>Dynegy</italic> took over <italic>InterNorth</italic> when <italic>Enron</italic> defaulted, <italic>Berkshire </italic>bought unstable <italic>Dynegy</italic> in 2001. \nWhile <italic>Enron</italic> had saved a failed wind firm earlier, GE bought the firm after <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s bankruptcy as the investor of last resort. <italic>Swiss Re</italic> faced her first losses in over a century in 2001 due to the collapse of <italic>World Trade Center</italic> and<italic> Enron </italic>claims. With the largest share of the liability in the consortium of insurers covering <italic>World Trade Center</italic>, there was a legal dispute with <italic>Silverstein Properties</italic>, the owner of <italic>World Trade Center</italic>, over whether the attacks should be considered as one or two separate events for insurance purposes. <italic>Swiss Re</italic> paid out for a single event.\n<italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s bankruptcy also spread tailwinds to competitors. These issues along with FERC investigations into natural gas price manipulation during California\u2019s energy crisis led <italic>El Paso Corp</italic> to settle for a $1.6 billion with FERC and sell off asset from 2002 as a shareholder launched proxy fights among a 90% drop in stock price. <italic>Xcel</italic> had to repurchase NRG due to a drop in wholesale power prices in 2002. NRG was struggling with debt, and banks demanded more collateral. As the majority shareholder, <italic>Xcel</italic> was at risk of creditor lawsuits. This situation could cost <italic>Xcel</italic> the amount they had invested in NRG. Despite revenue and profit growth since 1999, demand fell in 2002, leading to NRG filing for bankruptcy in 2003. Soon after, as PG&E came out of bankruptcy in 2004, commissioners counted \u2018regulatory\u2019 assets to allow rate hikes.\nMeanwhile, telecoms reorganized. Back in 1981, Britain established <italic>British Telecom</italic> (\u201cBT\u201d) as a separate, state-owned entity and allowed competitors in the domestic telephone network. <italic>Mercury Communications</italic>, founded in 1981, became a significant long-distance communications competitor on a digital network. By 1984, Britain privatized BT via <italic>Kleinwort Benson</italic> and established regulatory oversight. That year, Congress revoked AT&T\u2019s telecom monopoly to promote competition. While broke up AT&T into seven \u2018Baby Bells,\u2019 keeping the telephone and cable cross-ownership ban. Milken\u2019s HYB helped these risky ventures to consolidate and build internet infrastructure as IBM, IT&T, and over 100 others entered the long-distance market. While GTE merged with <italic>Sprint</italic> in 1983, market share troubles led her to sell <italic>Sprint</italic> to <italic>United Telecom</italic>. As access charges increased, IBM\u2019s telecom division merged with MCI. Through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, MCI and <italic>Sprint</italic> emerged as AT&T\u2019s primary competitors. Like <italic>Enron</italic>, MCI and other telecoms shifted from issuing HYB to investment grade debt. \nFollowing the Duopoly Review of 1990, Britain aimed to enhance telecoms competition. Even though BT continued to dominate the market, competition from <italic>Mercury</italic> grew. To remain competitive, BT invested in digital technology ventured into international markets. As AT&T acquired <italic>McCaw Cellular</italic> in 1993, BT bought 20% of MCI. In reaction, <italic>Sprint</italic> formed alliances with <italic>Deutsche Telekom</italic> and <italic>France Telecom</italic> in 1995; however, regulatory obstacles caused a delay in these efforts.\nSince finishing her three-year term on the board of <italic>Federal Communications Commission</italic> (\u201cFCC\u201d) in 1989, Patricia Diaz joined <italic>Sprint</italic> until President Bush Sr appointed her as the first Hispanic Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights & Humanitarian Affairs in 1992 until Bush lost re-election. After briefly joining <italic>Sullivan Cromwell</italic> in DC and Spanish-language network <italic>Telemundo</italic>\u2019s board, Diaz became SVP and General Counsel at Bell <italic>Pacific</italic> in 1995.\nBy 1996, Congress allowed telecoms to integrate with broadcast and cable. As tax incentives and market diversification fueled mergers, <italic>Bell Atlantic</italic> and <italic>Nynex</italic>\u2014two of the \u2018Baby Bells\u2019\u2014combined in 1996. After delays, <italic>Deutsche Telekom </italic>and<italic> France Telecom </italic>invested in <italic>Sprint</italic> in January 1996. Having allied with Spain\u2019s <italic>Telefonica</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London-advised BT and <italic>Lazard</italic>-advised MCI chose to merge by November. But as MCI registered a large loss in 1997, shareholders called for a renegotiation. By 1998, EU required members to open markets. \nHaving gained DOJ approval in April 1996, <italic>Bell</italic> Southwest and <italic>Bell</italic> Pacific became the first phone companies to receive FCC permission to merge in early 1997. The combined SBC retained Patricia Diaz to help them grow. While <italic>Salomon </italic>advised SBC\u2019s merger with AT&T, the deal unraveled over regulatory fears and executive clashes. Along with investment bankers, <italic>Salomon</italic>\u2019s telecom equity analyst advised <italic>WorldCom</italic>, which on top of tax incentives,<italic> </italic>wrote off acquisitions to manage earnings, driving further acquisitions. \nAgainst <italic>Rothschild</italic>- and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>-advised BT, <italic>Salomon</italic>-advised <italic>WorldCom </italic>and <italic>Goldman</italic>-advised GTE in separate bidding war for MCI,<italic> </italic>advised by<italic> Lazard</italic> and <italic>Lehman</italic>. As <italic>WorldCom</italic> secured a merger with MCI in late 1997, BT abandoned her MCI merger efforts, potentially unraveling her alliance with Spanish <italic>Telefonica</italic>. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1997,</italic> Vladimir Potanin\u2019s <italic>Oneximbank</italic> consortium partnered with <italic>Deutsche </italic><italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, and <italic>Soros</italic> to outbid Vladimir Gusinsky\u2019s <italic>MOST-Bank</italic> syndicate with <italic>Alfa Bank</italic>, <italic>Menatep</italic>/<italic>Yukos</italic>, CSFB, and <italic>Telefonica</italic> for privatized telecom <italic>Svyazinvest</italic>.  Soros soon called the transaction the worst investment decision of his career. \nWhile UST Secretary Robert Rubin\u2019s son Jamie held several senior policy positions with FCC from 1996, he resigned to advise on media transactions with <italic>Allen</italic> from 1998. After acquiring <italic>Salomon</italic> from <italic>Berkshire</italic> in late 1997, Sanford Weill\u2019s<italic> Smith Barney</italic> bought <italic>Citi </italic>in 1998. The same year, Michael Price, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s telecoms head, left to start <italic>FirstMark</italic> LBO<italic>. FirstMark</italic> partnered with lawyer Lynn Forester\u2014who married Evelyn Rothschild in late 2000 after he divorced his wife and sold <italic>Rothschild</italic> London to his cousin\u2014and raised funds from KKR, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>. Other banks hired industry insiders. After<italic> Penn State Uni</italic> graduate Lara Warner\u2014unrelated to <italic>Warner</italic> media\u2014worked at AT&T for a decade and rose to CFO for AT&T\u2019s National Competitive Local Exchange initiatives and Director of Investor Relations, she joined <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s Telecom\u2019s team in 1999 focusing on cable television, and laterally transferred to CSFB by 2002.\nShortly after Bill Gates founded <italic>Gates Foundation </italic>in 1994\u2014soon only rivaled only the <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic>\u2014his father William retired from his law firm\u2014although the firm retained his name\u2014to lead<italic> Rockefeller Foundation</italic> in 1998 as DOJ sued Microsoft for antitrust. Amidst competition with <italic>Microsoft</italic>\u2019s <italic>Internet Explorer</italic>, <italic>Netscape</italic> reported large losses in early 1998, followed by downsizing. \nThe same year, <italic>America Online</italic> (\u201cAOL\u201d) acquired <italic>Netscape</italic>.As <italic>WorldCom</italic> acquired MCI, telecoms M&A peaked in 1999, with largest deal being <italic>WorldCom</italic>\u2019s purchase of <italic>Sprint</italic> and <italic>Bell Atlantic</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>purchase of GTE. In 1999, AT&T acquired <italic>MediaOne</italic> with the intention to utilize cable TV networks for telephone and internet services. Deals with <italic>Comcast</italic> and <italic>Time Warner</italic> also brought more cable subscribers to AT&T. \nAfter SEC disallowed earnings-boosting tax-free pool mergers in mid-1999, she made FASB prohibit merger goodwill amortization and pool accounting in favor of purchase and impairment in June 2000. The same month, a court allowed DOJ to dissolve <italic>Microsoft</italic> for the first time since AT&T. As<italic> Microsoft</italic> reduced dominance to avoid dissolution, <italic>Google</italic>, <italic>Facebook</italic>, and other internet platforms to split digital marketing. From then Bill Gates steadily ceded <italic>Microsoft</italic> responsibilities to Steve Balmer, a sales executive who had been with the company since the beginning. While Gates remained Chair of <italic>Microsoft</italic>, he gradually shifted attention to <italic>Gates Foundation</italic>. \nSince <italic>Gates</italic> <italic>Foundation</italic>\u2019s asset more than doubled in 2006 as <italic>Berkshire</italic>\u2019s Warren Buffett committed to donate his wealth. <italic>Gates Foundation</italic> partnered with Buffet\u2019s son in 2008. Although Bill Gates\u2019 father William had retired in 1998 to lead <italic>Gates Foundation</italic>, his law firm continued merging. By 2007, only the Gates name remained in <italic>K&L Gates</italic>, Seattle\u2019s largest law firm with clients including <italic>Amazon</italic> and <italic>Microsoft</italic>. Soon after, Gates accused Dambisa Moyo\u2014a Zambian PhD with stints at <italic>BANK</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2014who argued that international aid organizations of crowding out private investment as \u2018promoting evil.\u2019\nAlso in June 2000, DOJ sued to undo <italic>WorldCom</italic>\u2019s acquisition of <italic>Sprint</italic>. Since the transaction would have grown <italic>WorldCom</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> pooled earnings, <italic>WorldCom</italic> turned to fraud. By August, DOJ allowed SBC and <italic>Bell </italic>South to form a wireless JV, <italic>Cingular</italic>, on condition of disposing certain assets to AT&T. Amidst the telecom meltdown, Michael Price and Lynn Forester Rothschild shuttered <italic>FirstMark</italic> in October. As AT&T split into four separate entities that month, <italic>Comcast</italic> acquired AT&T <italic>Broadband</italic> by 2001. Since UST Secretary Robert Rubin\u2019s son Jamie left FCC to advise on media transactions with <italic>Allen </italic>in 1998, he joined <italic>Morgan </italic>in 2001 to create <italic>One Equity Partners</italic> LBO. \nAfter <italic>Time Warner</italic> and AOL merged in 2001, the latter faced a client exodus, to a drastic drop in value. President of <italic>Time Warner</italic> since 1995, Richard Parsons became Chair in 2002, implementing strategies to reduce debt and instill investor confidence, selling assets like <italic>Warner Music</italic>, <italic>Time-Life</italic>, and <italic>Time Warner Book Group</italic>. Despite efforts to revive AOL through services like AOL<italic> Broadband</italic>, skepticism persisted.\nBy early 2002, <italic>WorldCom</italic>\u2019s internal auditors alerted the board and SEC, ending in <italic>WorldCom</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> bankruptcy under counsel of <italic>Weil Gotshal </italic>in July, the largest in American history. Like <italic>WorldCom </italic>used accounting tricks to raise capital cheaper than competitors, <italic>Verizon</italic> and others argued that bankruptcy reduced debt and allowed <italic>WorldCom </italic>to charge lower prices. By then the Clinton Administration ended, and Nicholas Rohatyn resigned from <italic>Morgan </italic>to join his father Felix to start <italic>Rohatyn</italic>, soon joining the boards of LVMH, <italic>Publics</italic>, and <italic>Comcast</italic>. <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Wasserstein could only watch from the sidelines as former partners reshaped American telecoms. By 2004, <italic>Morgan </italic>entered London investment banking by forming a JV and soon acquiring <italic>Cazenove</italic>.\nAs Rattner\u2019s <italic>Quadrangle</italic> advised on <italic>Comcast</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> acquisition of AT&T <italic>Broadband</italic> in November 2002,<italic> </italic>Rohatyn left <italic>Comcast</italic>\u2019s board and joined <italic>Quadrangle</italic> in advising on <italic>Comcast</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> unsuccessful takeover of <italic>Disney</italic>. By 2004, Rohatyn and Michael Price successfully advised <italic>Cingular</italic>\u2019s acquisition of AT&T <italic>Wireless</italic> in a bidding war with <italic>Vodafone</italic>. As Rohatyn, Price, and <italic>Lehman</italic> gained DOJ approval for SBC\u2019s acquisition of AT&T and SBC\u2019s acquisition of <italic>Bell</italic> South by 2005, telephony duopolized as DOJ allowed <italic>Verizon</italic> to buy <italic>WorldCom </italic>in 2006. By the decade\u2019s end, telecom advances proliferated internet exchange startups. While these platforms remained unregulated, calls for their regulation as public utilities increased as they monopolized the internet after the <italic>Panic of 2000</italic>.\nAs more failures spurred accounting fraud scandals, Congress enacted the <italic>Sarbanes-Oxley Accounting Reform & Investor Protection Act of 2002</italic> (\u201cSA2002\u201d)<italic>. </italic>SA2002 extended SEC\u2019s authority from disclosure requirements to corporate governance formerly within states\u2019 jurisdiction. As courts extended prison terms, these became life sentences for older managers. Rather than deter fraud, SA2002 incentivized defendants to waive jury trials and plead guilty. Moreover, SA2002 costs fell disproportionally on small securities firms. \nAfter his real estate developer father helped him become DOJ Attorney General, Spitzer charged <italic>Citi</italic> with deceptive marketing and questionable practices at <italic>Salomon Smith Barney</italic> in 2002. For Sanford Weill alleged direction to stock research analyst Jack Grubman to raise AT&T\u2019s rating to get business, <italic>Citi</italic> paid a $1.4 billion settlement and separated investment banking and equity research operations. As <italic>Morgan </italic>and <italic>Citi</italic> paid SEC to settle charges of manipulating <italic>Enron</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> balance sheet, FRS and OCC enforced an overhaul of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s risk management practices. While Sanford Weill stepped down from the colossus he created, Robert Rubin remained as Chair, and <italic>Citi</italic> bought <italic>Sears</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> credit card business.\nWhile losses at <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic> and sagging stock prices following the <italic>Panic of 2000</italic> forced M\u00fchlemann out as Chair of <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> by 2002, Quattrone destroyed evidence as SEC probed IPO research. Although regulators had evidence since 2002, DOJ Attorney General Spitzer charged Quattrone with a non-crime cover up after the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic> leaked emails in 2003. Since Milken made a plea deal with DOJ\u2019s Rudolph Giuliani, Quattrone became the most prominent banker charged in forty years. Before courts vindicated Quattrone in 2006, President Bush appointed <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette </italic>co-founder William Donaldson as SEC Chair in 2003. While often siding with Democrats in introducing new laws, backlash about his proposal for tightening hedge fund regulation led to his resignation in 2005. By then, Spitzer set his eyes on Maurice Greenberg, who built the world\u2019s largest insurer, AIG.\nInstead of Quattrone, Mack promoted <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic>\u2019s Hamilton James to Chair and energy banker Bayo Ogunlesi to Head of <italic>Global Investment Banking</italic>. As Hamilton James left CSFB to become Schwarzman\u2019s deputy at <italic>Blackstone\u2014</italic>having taken over <italic>Chicago & Northwestern</italic> RR together in 1989\u2014Mack added Ogunlesi to the Executive Committee in 2002. By 2004, Ogunlesi became Executive Vice Chair and Chief Client Officer to manage global corporate and sovereign clients. \nSince divorcing Michel Weill\u2019s daughter, Eduardo Stern grew his LBO. In 1999, two <italic>Harvard</italic> <italic>Business</italic> graduates, Ashish Dhawan and Raj Kondur, reached out to Stern to start a VC fund in India. Excited by the idea, Stern agreed to be Chair and adviser of their <italic>Chrysalis Capital Fund</italic> and co-invested with Indian CEOs in Silicon Valley. By July 2000, <italic>Chrysalis</italic> had invested in thirteen information technology companies, including service providers internet ventures, such as <italic>Baazee</italic>, <italic>Fabmart</italic>, <italic>JobsAhead</italic>, and <italic>E</italic><italic>gurucool</italic>. They also funded outsourcing companies like <italic>Spectramind</italic> and <italic>TransWorks</italic>, aiming to become leaders in call centers and remote services. As <italic>Stern</italic>\u2019s investment returns soured, Weill\u2019s <italic>Eurazeo</italic> withdrew funding from 2003. \nAfter dipping in the red in 1999, Udayan Bose\u2019s <italic>Lazard</italic> India fused into <italic>Lazard</italic>, which also merged the New York, London, and Paris operations into a single entity in 2000. By 2004, Bose accepted a buyout, and left to form <italic>Tamara Capital Advisors</italic>. Remaining <italic>Thomas Cook</italic> Chair, he joined <italic>Reliance Capital</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> board, and unsuccessfully to bid for an old private sector banks. \nIn 2003, Wasserstein recruited Gary Parr from <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> to be <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Deputy Chair. With <italic>Sullivan Cromwell</italic> a year after advising <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s merger with <italic>Bank One</italic> in 2004\u2014after which Jamie Dimon became CEO of the new <italic>Morgan </italic>\u2014Parr was part of a group that prepared <italic>Lazard</italic> for her IPO. To retain family control, Evelyn Rothschild sold <italic>Rothschild Continuation </italic>to his French cousin <italic>Edmond Rothchild</italic> and <italic>Jardine</italic>, allowing another French cousin to launch an LBO. After an on-again, off-again lover killed Stern in April 2005, Wasserstein outmaneuvered Weill to take <italic>Lazard</italic> public in December. From <italic>Goldman</italic>, former <italic>Lazard</italic> Vice Chair Kendrick Wilson led the transaction. \nBy then Mack left CSFB without a renewed contract, Purcell reorged <italic>Morgan Stanley</italic>, prompting Perella and McGuire to resign. As Head of Fixed Income Zoe Cruz sided with Purcell against Virkam Pandit and other traders, Purcell promoted Cruz to co-President, forcing Pandit to leave before he himself was replaced by Mack with the support of former Chair Seymour Gilbert, Harold Stanley\u2019s stepson. \nWhile Mack offered Perella a chance to return, which he declined due to the continued presence of Zoe Cruz, a Purcell ally. In 2006, Perella and former <italic>Morgan Stanley</italic> colleague Tarek Abdel-Meguid began planning a new firm, consulting with Sanford Weill and Stephen Schwarzman. That same year, they partnered with Peter Weinberg\u2014former <italic>Goldman</italic> partner and grandson of Sidney Weinberg\u2014to launch independent M&A advisor <italic>Perella Weinberg</italic>. Likewise, Pandit formed a hedge fund. While <italic>Citi</italic> soon bought Pandit\u2019s hedge fund, McGuire became <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s co-head investment banking. \nWhile FERC increased contract disclosure terms for energy utilities, SEC and FASB overhauled mark-to-market accounting and SPVs, banned mark-to-market for physical derivatives, and limited profits from the entire contract amount to revenues. Moreover, they changed SPV reporting from majority voting interest to financial risk. Likewise, EA2005 granted FERC enforcement powers against market manipulation. Studies have not found evidence of energy market manipulation. Similarly, <italic>Virgin Airline</italic> and <italic>Master</italic>, an energy short hedge fund, blamed commodity inflation on OTC derivatives and long-only funds. Studies have found no link.\nBy 2010, FDIC closed three of Puerto Rico\u2019s seven exchange listed banks, echoing 1991 New Hampshire. <italic>Enron</italic> developed Puerto Rico\u2019s natural gas since the 1990s, but PRPA did not convert oil PUs. As natural gas prices collapsed against oil prices after the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, PRPA began converting an oil PU into gas as FRS <italic>New York </italic>called out how expensive electricity was there in 2012. As Puerto Rico\u2019s governor lowered electricity prices and issued debt to build renewables, bank credit ran from PRPA, and defaulted on her debt in 2014. \nAs FRS <italic>New York </italic>called out default risk, Puerto Rico enacted a bankruptcy law for PRPA. After a district court supported bondholders, Congress enacted BA2016 to create a bankruptcy-like board (\u201cPRB\u201d) to restructure Puerto Rico\u2019s debts. After PRB allowed PRPA filed for bankruptcy, Hurricane Maria ended electricity for months. While PRB forced contingent sales tax revenues on bondholders in 2022, PRPA remained without agreement.\nMeanwhile, old alliances realigned. Umberto Agnelli\u2019s son took over <italic>Piaggio</italic> scooters in 1993, he and his mother died within four years, prompting the family to sell to TPG and <italic>Deutsche</italic><italic> Morgan</italic> <italic>Grenfell</italic> LBOs. Since Umberto\u2019s brother Gianni died in 2003, Umberto took over <italic>Fiat</italic> until dying in 2004. At that point, Gianni\u2019s grandson John Elkann\u2014whose maternal grandfather was the French Jewish banker Jean-Paul Elkann\u2014became head of <italic>Fiat</italic> and appointed Sergio Marchionne to revitalize <italic>Fiat</italic>. \nLike <italic>Fiat</italic>\u2019s Gianni Agnelli invested in real estate with Andr\u00e9 Meyer and <italic>Rockefeller</italic>, the family bought <italic>Cushman Wakefield</italic> from <italic>Mitsubishi</italic> in 2007. In 2015, <italic>Orl\u00e9ans</italic> became <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris. The family had acquired <italic>Orl\u00e9ans</italic>, a discontinued railroad shell that remained exchange listed, as a HC for activities after France nationalized <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris in 1982. \nAlso in 2015, since his father Amschel Rothschild committed suicide in 1996, James married hotelier socialite Nicky Hilton. But risks continued to grow. In 2017, <italic>Tikehau Capital</italic> bought 8% of <italic>Eurazeo</italic>. Fearing control loss, Weill bought <italic>Credit Agricole</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> 15%. Providing funds for the deal, the Decaux family gained two board seats and agreed not to buy more than 23% of <italic>Eurazeo</italic>\u2019s stock or sell any for three years. Moreover, past allies grew into competitors. After leaving <italic>Vivendi</italic>, Jean-Marie Messier advised a boutique advisory firm in 2010, selling a 66% stake to <italic>MedioBanca</italic><italic> </italic>in 2019. That year, <italic>Messier</italic> advised <italic>Peugeot </italic><italic>Citro\u00ebn</italic> on combining into the world\u2019s third largest auto manufacturer with <italic>Fiat </italic><italic>Chrysler</italic>, advised by <italic>Goldman</italic>. \nSince Michel Weill left <italic>Lazard</italic> for <italic>Eurazeo</italic> in 2003, he came to depend on Virginie Morgon. Born in Lyon, Morgon joined <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in 1993, later moving to London and Paris. She became <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s youngest managing partner at 32 in 2001. In 2008, Morgon joined <italic>Eurazeo</italic> and became General Director in 2014 and succeeded Patrick Sayer as Chair in 2018. Morgon expanded <italic>Eurazeo</italic>\u2019s global presence into America, China, and South America, increasing holdings from around 5-7 to about 40. Under her leadership, <italic>Eurazeo</italic> invested in asset manager <italic>Idinvest Partners</italic> in 2018 and <italic>Rh\u00f4ne</italic> in 2019 and companies such as IES (<italic>International Education Services</italic>) and <italic>Damartex</italic>. In 2020, <italic>Eurazeo</italic> signed the <italic>Diversity Charter</italic> under her guidance.\nIn April 2022, Michel down from Chair to the Supervisory Board, and Jean-Charles Decaux took his place. At the same time, <italic>Eurazeo</italic> promoted Virginie Morgon to CEO, making her one of the few women in the world to lead a major LBO firm. <italic>Eurazeo</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> stock has remained relatively flat under the leadership of Morgon, despite the firm\u2019s growing assets under management and diversifying investment strategies. After Michel Weill died in June 2022, his daughters inherited his <italic>Eurazeo</italic> stakes. While the Weills renewed their <italic>Eurazeo</italic> shareholder agreement for another three years, the Decaux-led Supervisory Board removed Morgon, ending the Lazard family\u2019s direct influence. \nEvelyn Rothschild died around the same time as Michel. Unlike the Lazard Weill family, the Rothschild family, led by David Rothschild and his son Alexandre, announced plans to delist <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris from <italic>Paris Stock Exchange</italic> to maintain family control reflecting the long-standing friendly rivalry between the two banking dynasties. The family, including Jacob\u2019s daughter, Hannah, along with the Peugeot and Dassault families took <italic>Edmond Rothchild</italic> private in 2023. Since <italic>Edmond Rothchild</italic> acquired a 42.5% stake in <italic>Hottinger </italic>in 2022, <italic>Hottinger </italic>expanded into America, serving over 200 wealthy families globally out of London.  By 2023, <italic>Lazard</italic> acquire <italic>Truvvo</italic> to form <italic>Lazard</italic> Family Office Partners.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic> </italic><italic>Panics of 2007 & 2012</italic>\nWhile American banks reigned supreme in many ways, the emphasis on mathematics at French elite schools led, Antoine Paille and his team at <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> to venture into options, equity derivatives, and structured products from 1970s. French-trained finance specialists gained global recognition in mathematically intensive fields, with <italic>BNP Paribas</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> playing pivotal roles in shaping derivatives markets. Networks of French-trained quants soon gained influential positions, not only in Paris, but London and Hong Kong as well. In New York, for example, Didier Javice, grew up and studied in Paris before joining <italic>Goldman</italic> in risk management from 1986 to 1997. Afterward, he managed several systematic hedge funds, including <italic>Dynamic Capital Management</italic>, <italic>Risk Management Advisors</italic>, <italic>W Fund Advisors</italic>, and <italic>1859 Capital</italic>.\nAs Soros, Rohatyn, and Buffett decried derivatives by the 1990s, <italic>Berkshire</italic> and AIG\u2014after Rohatyn introduced Buffet to Greenberg\u2014failed in their joint bid for LTCM after <italic>Bear</italic>\u2019s Cayne stopped clearing. Although the SPV-like <italic>money market mutual funds</italic> (\u201cMMMFs\u201d) originated as arbitrage to <italic>Reg Q</italic> in 1970, they survived when FRS eliminated <italic>Reg Q</italic> in 1982. While BA1978 de-prioritized banks and secured creditors to favor leases and CP, FDIC deposit insurance caps incentivized businesses to invest into diversified MMMFs instead of taking on the risk that FDIC forces unsecured depositor haircuts of failed banks. Likewise, SEC exempted MMMF from bank capital requirements and allowed <italic>net asset values</italic> (\u201cNAV\u201d) reporting in 1983. So, MMMFs mimicked safe bank deposits\u2014despite the lack of federal insurance\u2014cheaper than banks allowing them to pay higher rates. \nAs creditors ran from Milken\u2019s high yield CP during the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>, SEC required MMMFs to invest in highly rated CP. While BA1978 precipitated the <italic>Panic of 1980</italic> by cramming down unsecured credit reorgs, this did not extend to secured real estate mortgages. So, when a court allowed mortgage cramdowns in 1989, lenders ran from mortgages. The Court disallowed such <italic>Chapter 13</italic> cramdowns in 1993, and  did so for <italic>Chapter 11</italic> to resume credit. Although courts disagreed regarding Congress\u2019 intent, mortgage lending competition grew.\nWhile some PUHCs managed water assets between 1880 and the 1930s, a third of municipally owned water utilities had been private at one time. Although public and private water utilities had similar disease rates, Black life expectancy soared as racist municipal officials improved water and sewer systems to \u2018protect\u2019 White neighborhoods. Poor credit, education, employment, housing, civil rights, and healthcare access continued. In 1935, the  reduced municipal welfare liabilities with grants for pensions and aid to poor children. Since Congress created EEOC in 1964 against labor discrimination, regulated firms hired Blacks over others. By the late 1960s, Congress expanded the latter with President Johnson\u2019s <italic>Great Society</italic>, particularly helping single Black mothers. From the 1970s, this aid reversed.\nAmong the reforms of the 1960s, the <italic>Voting Rights Act of 1965</italic> expanded Black political power. As Black elites aimed to address Black-on-Black crime and the blindness of White police to existing social stratifications within Black communities. Black leaders believed that having Black police officers could help differentiate between education and skin color, potentially reducing Black-on-Black violence. However, the convergence of church influence and the government\u2019s war on drugs inadvertently fueled a surge in police presence, often comprising Black officers, who then became part of the complex cycle of Black-on-Black crime.\nLeveraging decades of affirmative action, minorities accessed a spectrum of advantages spanning from complimentary prestigious preparatory schools and Ivy League degrees to sought-after internships within investment banks and consultancies. These internships, akin to caste-like conduits, propelled them towards positions in LBOs, corporate directorships, and governmental roles. Through the 1980s, Black mayors and other municipal officials channeled lucrative bond deals to <italic>Howard Gary</italic>, <italic>Grigsby Brandford</italic>, <italic>Pryor McClendon Counts</italic> and other Black-owned securities firms as part of affirmative action. By the late 1980s, Black and Hispanic law firms grew, the largest being <italic>Adorno Yoss</italic>. However, as Protestant firms began competing for talent, they started to eliminate discriminatory practices, which diminished the need for Jewish and other minority and women-owned (\u201cMWO\u201d) law and financial firms. \nOther MWO-banks also grew. Since 1971, <italic>Lumbee Guaranty Bank</italic> of Pembroke, North Carolina was the first, and for a long time largest, Native American owned bank. Since Chow Chan founded <italic>Cathay Bank</italic> in 1962 as Southern California\u2019s first (and for a decade only) Asian-American commercial bank after experiencing bank and regulator discrimination, they founded <italic>East-West </italic>S&L, the Asian community\u2019s first S&L by 1973. And in 1974, another Chinese immigrant established America\u2019s first Asian-American-owned federally chartered bank, <italic>Far East</italic> NB in Los Angeles\u2019 Chinatown. While California\u2019s Asian-owned banks multiplied, <italic>Cathay Bank</italic> remained the largest, but found herself in a scandal for making only 1 of her 121 home loans to a Hispanic and none to Blacks in 1991. Officials responded that they received no applications from blacks and only 11 from Hispanics.\nAfter <italic>International Bank of Commerce</italic> (\u201cIBC\u201d) started in 1966 in Laredo, Texas, Dennis Nixon has served as the President and CEO of IBC from 1975, overseeing its growth. Forming a BHC in 1980 with branches in San Antonio and Zapata, as well as a LIC and an export trading company, IBC became the largest MWO-BHC and one of the largest independent banks in Texas and Oklahoma. In 1987, Laredo, Texas, grappled with persistent economic challenges, marked by high poverty rates, elevated unemployment, and prevalent diabetes and tuberculosis, with approximately 33% of the population relying on food stamps. \nIBC\u2019s Nixon emphasized the need for changes in customs policies to spur economic development in the region, which helped lead to a customs union with America and Canada (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). Laredo would soon become the nation\u2019s largest dry port and fourth-largest port overall. Since selling his MWO bank to <italic>Bank of America</italic> in 1981, Cuban refugee Carlos Arboleya remained Vice Chair and COO until retiring in 1994. Fellow Cuban Roberto Goizueta of <italic>Coca Cola</italic> remained the only Hispanic <italic>Fortune 500</italic> CEO until 1995, when two other Cuba exiles joined the ranks, followed by Hispanics from other countries overtime.\nWhile not an MWO, Chicago\u2019s <italic>Shorebank</italic> operated as a community development financial institution (\u201cCDFI\u201d) since 1973. By 1985, Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton began promoting similar CDFIs for Black customers. When DA1989 created the <italic>Resolution Trust Corp</italic> (\u201cRTC\u201d) to dispose of failed S&Ls, the Congressional Black caucus achieved the RTC <italic>Minority Counsel Program</italic> to promote MWO in financial institutions and legal services, funneling millions of dollars in legal fees to hundreds as one of the most ambitious federal preference efforts. After working at a Boston MWO-law firm, Wanda Brown coordinated New York state\u2019s housing and medical finance debt issuance from 1985. Following RTC <italic>Minority Counsel Program</italic>, Brown helped create the state\u2019s version of the program to MWO. In 1989, she moved to <italic>Dillon</italic> and then <italic>Lazard</italic> in 1992. At the latter, she financed municipalities, particularly water PUs. (She later became Bermuda\u2019s first lady.) \nBy then, Black entertainers and MWO-<italic>Johnson Publishing</italic> and <italic>BET Holdings</italic> built significant wealth and national prominence, soon becoming overrepresented across professional sports, music, and other media, gaining control of politically and financially valuable direct distribution. In 1989, shortly after opening their Chicago office, William Lewis became <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s first Black Managing Director, promoted faster than anyone in the firm\u2019s history. After Joseph Perella left <italic>Wasserstein Perella</italic>, Raymond McGuire left to direct <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s M&A. By 2000, he joined Perella at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> as global co-head of M&A. \nStill, Reginald Lewis\u2019 TLC<italic> Beatrice International</italic> from 1987 remained the largest MWO business. After the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic>, <italic>McCall </italic>filed for bankruptcy and sued Lewis for misrepresentation. Lewis prevailed in two lawsuits. By 1992, Lewis was diagnosed with brain cancer, designating his half-brother as his successor to chair TLC<italic> </italic>before dying in 1993. After a year of poor performance, Lewis\u2019 Philippine widow contested the will, and became the new chair. As the company\u2019s financial struggles continued, TLC<italic> </italic>sold off its food distribution business in late 1997, losing her<italic> </italic>status as the largest Black-owned business. \nIn conflict with the gospel of prosperity, Black churches\u2019 social gospel aim to uphold and advance the civil rights movement\u2019s legacy. Reverend Milton Weston was born in Tarboro, North Carolina, in 1910, the son and grandson of Episcopal priests. After graduating from <italic>Columbia </italic>in 1928, Weston led <italic>Saint-Philip\u2019s Episcopal Church</italic> in Harlem. After being denied a New York bank charter, Weston founded <italic>Carver </italic>under a federal charter in 1948 to address racial discrimination in lending by White banks. From the 1970s, conservative MWO banks like <italic>Carver</italic> made almost no loans, except to churches. While making the minimum federally mandated low-income mortgages, the banks bought ABCP.\nSince most Black-owned banks closed in the 1930s, several, including Maggie Walker\u2019s <italic>Consolidated Bank & Trust</italic> (1903) and Herman Perry\u2019s <italic>Citizens Trust</italic> (1921), remained active. With Black Northward migrations, <italic>Tri-State Bank </italic>of Memphis fell in rank to between 11th and 13th on <italic>Black Enterprise</italic>\u2019s list of Black-owned banks during the late 1980s. Since his father joined <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> in 1949, ultimately becoming CEO, and resigning in 1989, Jesse Turner Jr took over and would lead for the next three decades. After Maceo Walker orchestrated the purchase of <italic>Security</italic> LIC of Jackson, Mississippi, in 1986, <italic>Black Enterprise</italic> named <italic>Universal</italic> LIC, the fourth-ranked Black LIC,<italic> </italic>\u2018Company of the Year\u2019 in 1987. Despite his success, Walker voiced frustration about the limited business transactions between Black- and White-owned businesses, which he believed hindered the growth of his companies. However, it was <italic>Carver</italic> and fellow New York-based <italic>Freedom </italic>NB<italic> </italic>that became among two of the largest Black-owned commercial banks. When <italic>Freedom </italic>NB failed during the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>, <italic>Carver </italic>became New York\u2019s only Black-owned bank and one of the largest in the country.\nAfter the Court blocked the use of statistics from courts as evidence of racial bias, the <italic>Panic</italic> exacerbated Black unemployment, particularly among urban men and single mothers. Likewise, municipalities withdrew from preferential practices with Black-owned bankers and businesses. Although Black employees remained overrepresented in corporations, Congress codified the use of hiring statistics use with the <italic>Civil Rights Act of 1991</italic>. Alongside, the <italic>Immigration Act of 1990</italic> allowed the immediate family members of immigrants without numerical limits, inadvertently leading to a significant rise in immigration from Asia and Latin America. \nSince 1987, Laredo, Texas, grappled with persistent economic challenges, marked by high poverty rates, elevated unemployment, and prevalent diabetes and tuberculosis, with approximately 33% of the population relying on food stamps. As President and CEO of the largest MWO-BHC, Laredo-based <italic>International Bank of Commerce</italic> (\u201cIBC\u201d), Dennis Nixon emphasized the need for changes in customs policies to spur economic development in the region. To appeal to Mexico, President Bush Sr appointed New Mexico-born Patricia Diaz as the first Hispanic Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights & Humanitarian Affairs in 1992.\nWhile <italic>Great Society</italic> grants encouraged out-of-wedlock births, laws protected only monogamous relationships even for matrilineal cultures. Instead, EEOC promoted WEB DuBois\u2019 vision of fostering a Black elite, the \u2018talented tenth,\u2019 from private interests like <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic> to federally funded affirmative action on a national scale. So, decades of federal civil rights reforms exacerbated minority real estate wealth and income inequality. As President Bush Sr hired Franklin Raines left <italic>Lazard </italic>to lead <italic>Fannie Mae</italic>, Congress instructed <italic>Fannie </italic>and<italic> Freddie Mac</italic> to stimulate low-income housing construction. In the 1992 Presidential election, Democrat Rohatyn supported Ross Perot\u2014whom he knew since the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>\u2014splitting the Republican vote with Bush Sr, letting Bill Clinton win. \nAs the head of Clinton\u2019s presidential transition team and a close advisor to the President, Vernon Jordan helped shape the administration\u2019s policies and priorities. Refusing to become the first Black Attorney General, Jordan remained <italic>Akin Gump</italic> to continue lobbying. Like he advocated for free trade with Mexico\u2014which led to a customs union with America and Canada (\u201cNAFTA\u201d)\u2014he connected <italic>McKinsey </italic>to South Africa. And after enacting GSE legislation to shape <italic>Fannie Mae</italic> and <italic>Freddie Mac</italic> regulation, Clinton appointed Puerto Rican Aida Alvarez, latest a VP with CSFB, as the first Director of <italic>Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight</italic> by 1993. \nAfter electing her first two Jewish mayors, New York City chose her first Black mayor in 1990, David Dinkins over DOJ\u2019s Rudy Guiliani. Shortly afterward, a fatal car accident involving Hasidic Rabbi Schneerson\u2019s motorcade in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, resulted in violent clashes between Black civil rights groups and Jewish communities. These clashes led to looting and murders, for which an assailant was later acquitted. \nAround the same time, California elected civil rights activist Maxine Waters to Congress. After joining the state\u2019s Assembly in 1976, Waters married Sidney Williams. Williams had been a prominent athlete and chief of staff for Los Angeles\u2019 councilman before transitioning to selling cars at a Los Angeles <italic>Mercedes</italic> dealership. Economic competition between Black Americans and new immigrants, particularly Koreans, escalated into the Los Angeles riots of 1992 following the acquittal of police brutality, with Korean businesses becoming targets due to strained relations with Black customers. <italic>Bank of America</italic>\u2019s CEO Richard Rosenberg promptly dedicated $200 million to help rebuild the marred neighborhoods. \nAmidst the riots, FRS called attention to banks were not following the <italic>Community Reinvestment Act of 1977</italic>. As Clinton promised to establish 100 banks modeled after <italic>ShoreBank</italic> in 1992, Congress enacted the <italic>Community Development Banking Act</italic> <italic>of 1994</italic> to promote economic revitalization and community development through CDFIs in underprivileged areas. While <italic>Carver </italic>went public in 1994, Congress based bank merger approvals on low-income investment by 1995. Believing his priestly background prepared him for banking, Reverend Milton Weston remained Chair into the 1990s and hired community leaders instead of businesspeople or bankers. When the long-time CEO retired, <italic>Carver</italic> hired New York regulator Thomas Clark. By 1994, President Clinton appointed Waters\u2019 husband Williams to be the first Black ambassador to the Bahamas. Williams soon invested and joined the board of Boston\u2019s <italic>OneUnited</italic> bank, which branched to California, lending to churches along the way. While CSFB municipals banker Ron Gault resigned in 1993 to co-head <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s new urban finance unit, he later became <italic>Morgan </italic>South Africa\u2019s first CEO.\nWhile Walkers remained the largest shareholders and continued to manage <italic>Universal</italic> LIC. Likewise, since his father joined <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> of Memphis in 1949, ultimately becoming CEO, and resigning in 1989, Jesse Turner Jr took over and led for the next three decades even though <italic>Black Enterprise</italic> stopped ranking the bank on her list of American Black-owned banks by 1992. Like their loan in the 1980s to the motel where Reverend Martin King Jr was assassinated, <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> led a syndicate loan to Memphis-based <italic>Christian Methodist Episcopal Church</italic> to save historically-Black<italic> Texas College</italic> in the mid-1990s.\nLikewise, New York City Mayor Dinkins appointed Deborah Wright as <italic>Housing Commissioner</italic>. (Deborah graduated from <italic>Harvard</italic>, <italic>Harvard</italic> Business, and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law by the age of 26 in 1984. Joining CSFB in corporate finance, she left in 1987 to become an affordable home ownership advocate in Harlem. While her relationship to <italic>Citizens & Southern</italic>\u2019s Richard Wright is unclear, her grandfather was a reverend in South Carolina and her aunt, Marian, was a civil rights advocate, <italic>Yale</italic> Law graduate, and founder of <italic>Children</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Defense Fund </italic>in 1973. Like the wives of Vernon Jordan, Kenneth Chenault, and other Black elites, Marian was a member of <italic>Jack & Jill</italic>, which Dorothy Wright co-founded in 1946.) \nAnd as enrollment surpassed 20% at some universities in 1993, Asian-American became the new Jews after universities implemented ethnic quotas to disconnect academic performance from enrollment, which remained consistently around 16.5% from 1995 to 2011.\nSince TA1986\u2019s health inflation pushed middle class consumers to credit cards for liquidity. Since the Court unchained credit card interest rates from state usury laws in 1978, creditors increasingly lent to subprime borrowers. The legislation of the 1970s prohibited merchants from imposing surcharges on credit card transactions to offset the interchange fees charged to them directly. However, it permitted merchants to offer discounts for cash purchases. \nAs credit cards enticed consumers with rewards, this law forced consumers with lower education, income, predictable cash flows, or credit scores to pay for the rewards in a \u2018reverse Robin Hood\u2019 situation. With growing health expenses and other expense burdens, consumers\u2014primarily single women\u2014filed for bankruptcy to discharge their debt in historic numbers after the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>. And as unemployment grants and out-of-wedlock births peaked, Clinton stabilized UST budget deficits, Congress replaced <italic>Great Society</italic> grants with poor law-like earned income tax credits, collapsing out-of-wedlock births.\nAlthough Black securities financiers suffered, most soon recovered. Underwriting muni deals for <italic>Lehman</italic>, Charles Bell\u2019s earnings soared by 1992 along with issuance. As <italic>Lazard</italic> exited the business due to allegations of misconduct, Bell left <italic>Lehman</italic> to start <italic>Bell</italic> in 1996. Within 2 months, <italic>Bell</italic> became advisor to Los Angeles and Compton, California, soon after. But as munis collapsed in the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, <italic>Bell</italic> shifted to asset management. Like with <italic>Lazard</italic>, misconduct allegations felled Calvin Grigsby. So, Muriel Siebert took <italic>Siebert</italic> public and merged with Napoleon Branford and another partner from <italic>Grigsby Brandford</italic>, Suzzane Shank, to create the largest MWO-securities firm by 1997. \nAs Clinton appointed her Head of SBA in 1997, Aida Alvarez became the first Latina and Puerto Rican to serve in the Cabinet, and increased loans to MWO small businesses. After an overspending scandal led Hazel O\u2019Leary to resign from DOE in early 1997, she joined her husband\u2019s consulting firm and later served as president and COO at <italic>Blaylock</italic>, a Black investment bank, briefly before returning to lead <italic>Fisk Uni</italic>.\nPerhaps the most successful was Robert Smith\u2019s technology private equity firm. After advising <italic>Apple</italic> and <italic>Hewlett-Packard</italic> at <italic>Goldman</italic>, Smith co-founded <italic>Vista Equity Partners</italic> in Austin, Texas, in 2000. Benefiting from MWO allocations and the <italic>Panic of 2000</italic>, <italic>Vista</italic> sucsesfully acquired struggling technology firms with pension dollars. Instead of hiring elites for government and bank contacts, <italic>Vista</italic> recruit people from diverse backgrounds, which helped lower costand turnover.\nMWO contracts had even greater impact outside of finance, transferring tax funds into private hands rather than larger public corporations. David Steward grew up in a segregated Clinton, Missouri, in a working-class family. After graduating from <italic>Central Missouri Uni</italic>, Steward began his career in sales at railroads and <italic>FedEx</italic>. In 1983, he acquired an auditing firm for the transportation industry that he developed into <italic>World Wide Technology</italic> (\u201cWWT\u201d). Focusing on government contracts for minority suppliers, he served state and federal governments. A significant contract to supply American troops in Bosnia in 1995 became available when <italic>General Electric</italic> lost the deal due to its failure to meet minority subcontracting targets. As WWT parlayed this contract to expand to federal agencies and major corporations, Steward became the richest Black American by the 2020s.\nImmigrating to America from Turkey in the 1980s and earning her MBA from <italic>Uni of Nevada</italic> in 1989, Eren joined her soon-to-be husband Fatih Ozmen at the small defense contractor <italic>Sierra Nevada Corp</italic> (\u201cSNC\u201d) in 1988. By 1994, the Ozmens purchased the 20 employee SNC. Eren became Chair, President, and CFO, while Fatih became CEO. Under their leadership, SNC became a certified woman-owned business, which allowed it to compete for federal contracts. The Ozmens expanded the company through ten acquisitions, including <italic>Advanced CounterMeasure Systems</italic> in 1998. Increased SNC\u2019s workforce to 2,000 employees and secured significant contracts with NASA and the <italic>Department of Defense</italic> by 2009, the largest woman-owned business made the Ozmens billionaires by winning contracts from larger publicly listed defense contractors.\nMore than Turks, Indians redefined global capitalism. A year after scandal forced <italic>Standard Chartered</italic> to sell<italic> Mocatta Goldsmid </italic>in 1997, the board named Rana Talwar, who became the first Asian to lead a top 100 <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> listed company. Having been with <italic>Citi</italic> since 1970, Talwar watched bankers run from emerging markets after the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>. His Indianness may have played a role in choosing to heavily invest. Buying <italic>Banco Exterior de Los Andes</italic> to access Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela in 1998, he subsequently acquired the global trade finance business of UBS, Thailand\u2019s <italic>Nakornthon Bank</italic> from the Wanglee family, and opened a Beijing branch. \nIn 2000, <italic>Standard Chartered</italic> bought ANZ <italic>Grindlay</italic>\u2019s South Asian and Middle Eastern banking operations and <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s Hong Kong consumer banking and credit card operations. By then Manjit Boual\u2014born in India into Sikh a family before moving to Britain as a child\u2014became COO of <italic>Dresdner Kleinwort </italic>and co-head of investment banking. (Following <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s Marjorie Scardino at <italic>Pearson</italic>, Boual became the first non-white female CEO of the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>\u2019s hundred largest companies as Chair of <italic>Provident Financial</italic> in 2014.)\nAs the Indian diaspora was the world\u2019s largest, Brahmin Hindus dominated highly skilled worker H-1B visas. Since America\u2019s <italic>Immigration Act of 1965</italic>, Indian Brahmins had expanded from land lording into urban professionalism, ranging from computer engineers in America to bank executives in India. While over 95% of Indians continued to marry in caste for decades, this shift altered their marriage criteria, with education and employment gaining significance in forging alliances among these urbanized families from the 1970s. Similar to the Jewish Kohen priestly caste, Brahmin Indians highly regarded scholarly pursuits and have a long history of involvement in banking. \nHowever, local affirmative action campaigns limited opportunities in India. After <italic>McKinsey</italic> hired her initial Indians Tino Puri and Rajat Gupta by 1973, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> hired Vikram Pandit in 1983. (The son of the executive director <italic>of Sarabhai Chemicals</italic> whose surname translates to scholar and priest in Hindi.) After Ashish Bhutani graduated <italic>Concordia Uni</italic> and <italic>Pace</italic> Business, he became a fixed income trader at <italic>Salomon</italic> in 1985, and later joined <italic>Wasserstein</italic> <italic>Perella</italic>, becoming head of <italic>Dresdner </italic>America after the acquisition in 2000. As non-Americans became the majority at <italic>McKinsey</italic>, Gupta become the first non-American CEO. While traditional merchant castes continued to hold over 90% of large board directorates in India, dominated by several upper-caste surnames, mainly Agrawals and Guptas.\nAfter the <italic>Immigration Act of 1990</italic> allowed the immediate family members of immigrants without numerical limits, immigration from Asia and Latin America soared, accelerating income inequality. Likewise, more Indians combined computer engineering with banking. Sundararajan Venkatakrishnan became a risk officer with <italic>Morgan </italic>in New York in 1994. Generally, however, early Indian immigrants, primarily from agricultural Punjabi and commercial Gujarati backgrounds, were older and less educated, working mainly in lower-wage industries like retail and transportation as family-based migrants, which limited their professional opportunities. After 2000, newer immigrants from southern India were younger and more educated, often migrating for skill-based jobs in high-wage industries, particularly in professional services and technology.\nWithout oil reserves, India\u2019s FX reserves dwindled to less than a month\u2019s worth of imports by June 1991 amidst the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic> after Iraq invaded Kuwait and oil prices spiked in the <italic>Gulf War</italic>. And as India\u2019s new finance minister Manmohan Singh pivoted India from socialism to free markets, <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Gupta and Puri opened an India branch, whose clients soon <italic>included State Bank of India</italic>, <italic>Larsen & Toubro</italic>, <italic>RPG Enterprises</italic>, <italic>Hindustan Lever</italic>, <italic>Arvind Mills</italic>, <italic>Hindustan </italic><italic>Motor</italic><italic>, Shriram Fibres</italic>, <italic>Council for Leather Exports</italic>, <italic>Coca Cola</italic>, and <italic>State Industrial & Investment Corp of Maharashtra</italic>. Under Gupta, <italic>McKinsey</italic> hired Madras-born Sundar Pichai, who earned an Indian degree in metallurgy, <italic>Stanford </italic>engineering masters<italic>, </italic>and an MBA from <italic>Wharton</italic> in 2001. After three years of consulting, Pichai transitioned to developing <italic>Google</italic>\u2019s Internet browser in 2004.\nWhile Dalits faced widespread caste-based discrimination from Hindus in California, non-Hindu Sikh and Jain Indians rejected caste. Still, within the Hindu context, the Jains\u2019 multi-generational practice of commerce has made them part of the mercantile <italic>bania</italic> caste. Instead of caste, Jains use kindship to bridge finance and industry. Two Sikhs sons of lieutenant general Banga channeled the military discipline. Ajay Banga initially worked in consumer goods marketing with <italic>Nestl\u00e9</italic> and <italic>Pepsi</italic> in Delhi before transitioning to <italic>Citi</italic> India\u2019s credit card division in 1996. He was soon posted to <italic>Citi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s consumer bank in London. Meanwhile, Manvinder Banga spent three decades at <italic>Unilever</italic>, becoming Chair of <italic>Unilever</italic>\u2019s Indian unit the early 2000s.\nWhile the strategic nature of Banga played out overtime, it was more immediate with cousins Anshu and Ajit Jain. Both were born in India in the 1960s to adherents of Jainism, pursued symbiotic careers. As Anshu started in derivatives research at <italic>Kidder</italic>, Ajit joined <italic>McKinsey</italic>. In 1985, Ajit joined a former <italic>McKinsey</italic> colleague to lead <italic>Berkshire </italic>Reinsurance. His primary focus was insuring against \u2018super-catastrophes\u2019 like hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and cyclones in Southeast Asia. \nBy 1988, Anshu Jain left <italic>Kidder</italic> for <italic>Merrill</italic>. Over the following seven years, he became one of the firm\u2019s youngest-ever managing directors, covering global hedge funds. In 1995, Anshu followed his mentor Edson Mitchell from <italic>Merrill </italic>to establish <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s new investment banking division. Concurrently, Ajit Jain headed <italic>Berkshire </italic>Reinsurance and worked closely with Warren Buffett on various deals, leading some to speculate that Ajit could succeed Buffett.<italic> </italic>\nSince President Johnson\u2019s federal redistribution had spurred moral hazard in real estate. Congress created the National <italic>Flood Insurance Program</italic> (\u201cNFIP\u201d) in 1968 in response to the expensive flood insurance after Hurricane Betsy struck Louisiana. However, NFIP\u2019s coverage of flood-prone areas has led to increased development and greater losses from floods. In addition, NFIP\u2019s administrative expenses have taken up 40% of all collected premiums, with over 75% paid to private insurance intermediaries who do not bear any risk. As NFIP\u2019s taxpayer-funded disaster insurance grew to cover $1.23 trillion by the 2000s, each crisis multiplied losses. Reserve tax changes in the 1980s also made private catastrophe insurance prohibitively expensive. So, when insurers stopping voluntary coverage after large losses from Hurricane Andrew and the Northridge earthquake in the early 1990s, Florida and California forced involuntary underwriting associations to provide stopgap coverage for increasingly risky real estate.\nAnd after the Dutch allowed banks to expand globally in 1988, the country\u2019s two largest banks, ABN and AMRO, merged into ABN AMRO in 1990, controlling half of domestic corporate banking. Since 1979, ABN had acquired  Chicago\u2019s <italic>LaSalle Bank</italic>. After retaining <italic>William Blair</italic> to grow, ABN hired partner and Homer Livingston\u2014whose father had led <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic> for decades\u2014to restructure <italic>LaSalle</italic> NB, appointing him President and CEO in 1983 and expanded across the country soon after.\nSince Spain\u2019s <italic>Santander</italic> started in 1857 to facilitate trade between Spain and Latin America, the Botin family gained control in the 1920s. As <italic>Santander</italic> bought a large stake in <italic>Banesto</italic> in the early 1990s, <italic>Banco Central</italic> merged with <italic>Banco Hispano Americano</italic> into BCH in 1991. As Spanish banking regulations prevented subprime lending, <italic>Santander</italic> merged with BCH in 1999, and expanded in the Americas, buying <italic>Sovereign Bancorp</italic> S&L community lender by 2005.\nAs <italic>Goldman</italic> and other major banks led a one-directional oligarchy in America fostered by the anti-aristocratic Constitution, European banks adopted. Since President Bush Sr\u2019s cousin George Walker of Saint-Louis graduated from <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> in 1992 and joined <italic>Goldman</italic> in Mergers & Acquisitions in New York, later working in London and Frankfurt. By 1998, Walker became one of the youngest partners in <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s history. In August 1999, he was appointed co-Head of the firm\u2019s Wealth Management business as his cousin once removed campaigned for the presidency.\nCourt Justice Kennedy\u2019s son Justin became <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Head of CMBS Trading and a member of the firm\u2019s Principal Investment Group before joining <italic>Deutsche</italic> in 1998, where he soon became Global Head of Real Estate Capital Markets. Tobin Cobb also had an impressive pedigree. While his father was a real estate investor with <italic>Disney</italic> and served as Under Secretary of the Commerce Department under President Reagan and Ambassador to Iceland under President Bush Sr, his mother held roles including Ambassador to Jamaica, Secretary of State of Florida, CEO of <italic>Florida Lottery</italic>, and Chair of FRS <italic>Miami</italic>. After Tobin played leading roles in CRE investment banking groups at <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic> and <italic>Citi</italic>, he joined <italic>Deutsche</italic> in 2000, where he became Co-Head of American Commercial Real Estate, leading fixed rate and GSE originations and its loan servicing platform.\nIn Europe, on the other hand, <italic>Goldman</italic> adopted and engaged with policy elites symbiotically. The interchange between <italic>Goldman</italic> and governments was a two-way flow, with policymakers transitioning between roles, blurring lines between public and corporate interests. The wife of <italic>Goldman</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Chief Economist Garvyn Davies ran the office of <italic>Exchequer </italic>Chancellor Gordon Brown. \nOtmar Issing, the <italic>euro</italic>\u2019s key architect, served on the boards of Germany\u2019s <italic>Bundesbank</italic> and <italic>European Central Bank</italic> (\u201cECB\u201d) before joining <italic>Goldman </italic>International. <italic>Goldman </italic>International also hired Peter Sutherland, formerly Ireland\u2019s Attorney General, EC Commissioner, and <italic>World Trade Organization</italic> co-founder. Along with directing RBS and <italic>British Petroleum</italic>, Sutherland brought deals to <italic>Goldman</italic>. Mario Monti joined<italic> Goldman </italic>International\u2019s advisory board after serving as EC Competition Commissioner and Italy\u2019s Treasury Committee Chair. \nConversely, <italic>Goldman</italic> alum Petros Christodoulou moved to <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>(\u201cNBG\u201d). These arrangements helped <italic>Goldman</italic> sell cross-currency swaps and other derivatives to Italy and Greece, manipulating debt size to comply with <italic>euro</italic> rules on leverage. Becoming the first Greek bank to list on NYSE in 1999, NBG hired Kyriakos Mitsotakis from <italic>Alpha Bank</italic> to found a VC and private equity subsidiary. (Mitsotakis graduated from <italic>Harvard</italic> in 1990 before working in London for <italic>Chase</italic> and <italic>McKinsey</italic>, advising telecom and finance clients until 1997.) NBG also adopted a strategy involving the acquisition of mortgage and insurance companies to address nonperforming loans in 2000, simultaneously acquiring Macedonia\u2019s largest commercial bank. While 2004, Mitsotakis resigned to join Parliament with the New Democracy party, NBG continued to expand internationally, acquiring control of in banks across Turkey, Serbia, Albania, and Egypt by 2007.\nConsultancies and banks continued promoting from clients, politicians, and aristocrats. <italic>Pfizer</italic> CEO Jeff Kindler\u2019s son worked at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, WPP CEO Martin Sorrell\u2019s three sons worked at <italic>Goldman</italic>, and <italic>Blackstone</italic> CEO Stephen Schwarzman\u2019s son Teddy was an intern at <italic>Goldman</italic> and analyst at <italic>Citi</italic> before pursuing a career in the movie industry. \nFrom Britain, Arthur Mornington, a descendant of the Duke of Wellington, spent two years at <italic>Bain</italic> from 2001. Joining <italic>Charterhouse</italic> in 2006, HSBC\u2019s former LBO, he soon made partner. From France, Prince Jean-Christophe Napol\u00e9on, a descendant of Emperor Napoleon\u2019s brother, joined <italic>Morgan </italic>Stanley in 2009 for three years, then moved to <italic>Advent</italic> LBO and <italic>Blackstone</italic> from 2017, becoming a Principal. From Germany, James Moltke, the grandson of aristocrat Helmuth Moltke who tried to kill Hitler in 1944, served as Head of M&A at <italic>Citi</italic> from 2009 before becoming CFO of <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> in 2017.\nNepotism also promoted gender balance. The daughter of Washington state property developer Eugene Horbach, Sandra parlayed a start at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s M&A team into becoming partner at <italic>Forstmann Little</italic> in 1992 at the unusually young age of 32, making her the first female partner at a major American private equity. Like <italic>Morgan </italic>hired and trained Ana Botin before she left to run her father\u2019s <italic>Santander</italic>,<italic> Smith Barney</italic> hired <italic>Foremost</italic> shipping heiress and sister-in-law of Senator Mitch McConnell. Likewise, <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Rajat Gupta hired former-President Clinton\u2019s daughter in 2003, the youngest in her class.\nIn Germany, <italic>Dresdner</italic> and <italic>McKinsey</italic> Munich prepared Susanne Quandt. Born into a Protestant textile dynasty, Susanne\u2019s father Herbert\u2014the stepson of Chief Nazi propogandist Joseph Goebbels\u2014rescued BMW from financial trouble in 1954. Following his death in 1967, Herbert\u2019s widow Johanna became Deputy Chair of BMW\u2019s Board until 1997 when her daughter Susanne took over. \nWhile Martin Blessing\u2014a grandson of GBB\u2019s first President and son of a <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> board member\u2014resigned as <italic>McKinsey</italic> partner and became a<italic> Commerzbank</italic> executive by 2001, his wife, Dorothee\u2014daughter of Paul Wieandt, a former Chair of <italic>Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz</italic>, <italic>Bank f\u00fcr Kommunalwirtschaft</italic>, <italic>SchmidtBank</italic>, and other German banks<italic>\u2014</italic>joined <italic>Goldman</italic> Frankfurt as an M&A analyst in 1992 and became a Partner in charge of <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s German-speaking region after 2005. Likewise, <italic>McKinsey</italic> partner Stephan Leithner led to head of <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s European M&A team in 2000 and Global Co-Head of Corporate Finance in 2003.\nFrom 2004, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> of Cologne became Europe\u2019s largest family-owned private bank with the acquisition of <italic>Berliner Frankfurter Bank</italic> from ING. While Alfred Oppenheim had led <italic>Oppenheim</italic> since 1993, he died in 2005. Georg Oppenheim Ulman, his cousin\u2019s son, replaced Alfred as chair. Likewise, Ulman\u2019s brother-in-law, Matthias Krockow, became CEO. Krockow joined the bank in the mid-1980s after working with David Rockefeller, partnered with real estate developer Josef Esch, who steered the bank\u2019s operations.\nBy 2005, Mary Callahan became CEO of <italic>Morgan</italic> Private Bank after training under her father, <italic>Lazard</italic> Chicago\u2019s Patrick Callahan, since childhood. Since Matthew Stacom joined<italic> Cushman Wakefield</italic> in 1946, <italic>Rockefeller</italic> bought the real estate broker, and Stacom\u2019s wife and three daughters joined the firm. By 1996, Matthew was Vice Chair when his daughter Darcy became the firm\u2019s first female Executive Director after starting in the mailroom at 14. \nIn 2002, Darcy left to be Executive Director of <italic>Coldwell</italic> Commercial and her husband became Principal of <italic>Staubach</italic>. Later, Darcy was promoted to Vice Chair and joined <italic>Jones Lang LaSalle </italic>as Managing Director. While Matthew was Chair of <italic>Cushman Wakefield </italic>when he died, his daughter Tara rose to Vice Chair there, and advised on <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s lease renewal and expansion at <italic>Rockefeller Center</italic> in 2011. However, American real estate\u2019s wealthiest female executive was the daughter of <italic>Goldman DiLorenzo</italic>\u2019s Sol Goldman, despite nearly continuous litigation with her mother and siblings over their vast New York\u2019s real estate empire.\nIn Africa, the eldest daughter of Gabon\u2019s President Omar Bongo, Pascaline studied in Paris and worked at <italic>Chase</italic> and IMF before advising her brother as foreign affairs minister and heading the presidential office after their father\u2019s death. The eldest daughter of Botswana\u2019s Paramount Chief, Muriel Seboko worked at <italic>Barclay</italic> from 1971 until retiring in 1995 to become the first female Paramount Chief. \nIn China, banks vied for political connected princelings fiercely. In 1993, <italic>Bear</italic> hired Margaret Ren, daughter-in-law of former Premier Zhao Ziyang. Meanwhile, <italic>Smith Barney</italic> recruited the daughter of Vice-premier Zou Jiahua, and CSFB hired the 20-year-old daughter of Ding Guanggen, the former Communist Party propaganda chief and railways minister. Amidst this competition, <italic>Bear</italic> secured both Margaret Ren and the propaganda chief\u2019s son, winning the <italic>Guangshen</italic> RR listing. Ren soon joined <italic>Citi</italic>, followed by <italic>Merrill</italic>, naming her Chair of Investing Banking in China. And as <italic>Morgan </italic>Hong Kong hired Zhang Xixi, the daughter of <italic>China Railway Group</italic>\u2019s official in the early 2010s, political heiress Lan Yan became head of <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Greater China and built a predominantly female team of \u2018<italic>Lazard Sisters</italic>\u2019 with a focus on regulated industries.\nWhile there is little public information, nepotism appears to not have played a role for Rem\u2019s manager at <italic>Merrill</italic>. Born in Kenya and educated in Britain, Kalpana Desai studied at <italic>London School of Economics</italic> and became an accountant with <italic>Cooper Lybrand</italic> in London for three years until 1991. Pivoting to banking in London, she spent several years at <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> and <italic>Barclay</italic> until 1998. Having moved to Hong Kong, she joined <italic>Merrill</italic>, and became Head of the Asia-Pacific M&A by 2002.\nWhile legislation opened doors for women, the industry remained male-dominated, with over 70% of positions held by men, particularly in investment banking and trading roles. Since the late 1990s, <italic>Citi Smith Barney</italic>, <italic>Merrill</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, and other major Wall Street firms faced sex discrimination lawsuits, paying over hundreds of millions of dollars. In 1998, <italic>Stowell Friedman</italic> negotiated a settlement on behalf of 900 women in a union-like class-action gender discrimination lawsuit against <italic>Merrill</italic> that resulted in diversity initiatives. Along with another class action suit brought by 2,800 women settled in 2004,<italic> Merrill</italic> paid out over $200 million. In the same year, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> settled for $54 million in an EEOC case. These cases alleged gender-based pay disparities, denial of promotions, and exclusion from company events based on gender.\nIn 1998, New York\u2019s state law allowed banks in underserved communities to receive state and municipal-government deposits. Within a year, <italic>Chase</italic> alone had three branches on 125th Street. To compete, <italic>Carver</italic> started offering services like credit cards, auto loans, and ATMs, and opened a branch in predominantly African American Mount Vernon. \nHowever, they suffered losses due to bad loans, <italic>Carver</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> leader, Clark, was ousted by 1999. As <italic>Carver </italic>appointed former <italic>New York City Housing Commissioner</italic> Deborah Wright as CEO, she fought off a takeover attempt from <italic>OneUnited</italic>. Instead, Wright closed the Mount Vernon and other unprofitable branches, while opening a Harlem branch to take advantage of the 1998 law and raising private deposits from KKR. Combining churches and housing, <italic>Carver</italic> funded Abyssinian Baptist Church housing project in Harlem.\nLikewise, affirmative action monetized often connected American elites. As beneficiaries amassed influence in media and politics, they interwove through marriage to consolidate their affluence. And successive generations of their progeny benefited from this privilege even as Black dynasties thrived. With the death of her father in 2005, Linda Johnson took over <italic>Johnson Publishing</italic>. In Rivlin\u2019s stead, Clinton named Franklin Raines the first Black OMB director. \nWithin a year, Clinton named <italic>McKinsey</italic> partner Roger Ferguson the first Black FRS Vice Chair. (He became a <italic>Harvard</italic> Overseer soon after.) As Raines left OMB for <italic>Fannie</italic> in 1999, Vernon Jordan left <italic>Akin Gump</italic> to join <italic>Lazard</italic> as a senior director. Although Wasserstein promised Weill to curb hiring, Jordan helped him recruit William Lewis as <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s investment banking co-Chair in 2004. After 24 years with <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, most recently serving as co-head of the global banking group, <italic>Fortune</italic> magazine Lewis as the 13th most powerful Black executive, with his new partner Vernon Jordan ranked 9th. \nIn the 1970s, <italic>Merrill</italic> signed a consent decree with EEOC that required the securities firm to become more diverse and increase its proportion of Black brokers to 6.5%. That did not happen. Following <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s class action gender discrimination settlement, a Black broker out of Tennessee that had been with the company for dozens of years, initiated a class action racial discrimination lawsuit with <italic>Stowell Friedman </italic>in 2005. While the lawsuit claimed the absence of any Black brokers in 25 states and that only 2% of <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s brokers were Black despite the consent decree mandating 6.5%, <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s Black CEO, Stanley O\u2019Neal, argued that Black brokers could not secure predominantly White client base.\nDespite the immigration surge since the<italic> Immigration Act of 1965 </italic>and inter-racial marriage, America\u2019s <italic>Depart of Labor</italic> continued to promote minorities defined in the <italic>Civil Rights Act of 1964</italic>, irrespective of the incidence of discrimination by caste or wealth. While Hispanic elites and African plantation proprietors benefited from historical injustices more than most Eurasians, their descendants benefited from affirmative action. The son of Scottish mulattos from Jamaica, Colin Powell received his honorary knighthood in 1993, his last year as Chair of America\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff. And while Barack Obama, the son of a Black father from Kenya and a White mother from Kansas, benefited from affirmative action admission and tax-free grants to <italic>Columbia</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic>, he only had slave ancestry on his maternal side. \nBorn in Jamaica to descendants of the plantation-owning founder of one of island\u2019s oldest towns and slaves, Donald Harris was a Marxist economics <italic>Stanford </italic>professor from 1972 to 1998. While he married the daughter of an Indian Brahmin Secretary of State, who earned a <italic>Berkeley</italic> PhD in cancer research, the marriage did not last. Their daughter, Kamala Harris, became Los Angeles District Attorney by 2004, several years after her married boyfriend, California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, appointed her to a high post. \nAfter Chandrika Krishnamurthy, a daughter of a Brahmin banker, graduated <italic>Yale</italic>,<italic> </italic>she joined <italic>Citi</italic> Beirut in 1975 and <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 1979, and became the first female Southeast Asian partner. Marrying hedge funder Ranjan Tandon, Chandrika resigned and founded Tandon in 1992, where she consulted banks on efficiencies, including <italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s CFO Arjun Mathrani. \nLikewise, Chandrika\u2019s brother Narayan followed <italic>Yale</italic> and other degrees with experience at <italic>Smith Barney</italic>, <italic>Tiger Management</italic>, and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> before founding <italic>Trident Investment Management</italic>.  Their sister, Indra Nooyi, joined <italic>Boston Consulting Group </italic>after <italic>Yale</italic>, and then <italic>Pepsi</italic> in 1994. She became President in 2001, CEO in 2006, and Chair soon after. Nooyi became the 11th woman running a S&P 500 company, along with Patricia Woertz at <italic>Archer Daniels Midland</italic> and Irene Rosenfeld at <italic>Kraft Foods</italic>. Still, female corporate officers barely budged since 2002. \nUnder John Mack, Nigerian-born and Justice Thurgood Marshall\u2019s onetime clerk Bayo Ogunlesi rose to head CSFB\u2019s global investment banking department and joined the executive committee in 2002. By 2004, CSFB appointed Ogunlesi to Vice Chair and Chief Client Officer to manage global corporate and sovereign clients. Likewise, fellow French West Africans prospered.\nAfter inheriting plantations in Ivory Coast in the 1920s, F\u00e9lix Houphouet-Boigny united Black landowners to oust while colonists and become Africa\u2019s longest serving President from 1960 until his death in 1997. Since Houphouet-Boigny established his first plantation in 1926, his family expanded into various sectors including agroindustry, insurance, retail trade, electronics, telecommunications, and transportation. This family occupied the central role among Ivory Coast political-economic elite. Houphouet-Boigny\u2019s niece, Henriette Diabat\u00e9, married Amadou Thiam, a real estate developer. Amadou\u2019s son Tidjane had attended elite Parisian schools and worked for eight-years at <italic>McKinsey</italic> before returning to Ivory Coast to lead development initiatives from 1993. \nIn the early 18th century, Sekou Ouattara\u2019s coup in Kong, within modern-day Ivory Coast, established the Ouattara Empire, safeguarding the independence of Kong States amidst competition with Ghana\u2019s Ashanti. Since Houphouet-Boigny\u2019s Baoul\u00e9 ancestors were from Ghana, regional boundaries changed, Sekou\u2019s descendant, Alassane Ouattara, was born to a father from Ivory Coast and mother from Burkina Faso. Earning a doctorate from <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania </italic>in 1972, Alassane joined <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> in 1973, and soon became special adviser to Governor Abdoulaye Fadiga. When Burkina Faso\u2019s turn to promote a Vice-Governor in 1982, Houphouet-Boigny negotiated with the head of that government to appoint Alassane.\nSoon after, Alassane Ouattara rose to Governor for two-years before Houphouet-Boigny appointed him the PM and Finance Minister of Ivory Coast in 1990. However, as Houphouet-Boigny died in 1993, leadership transitioned to Henry Bedie, with Baoul\u00e9 cocoa planter origins tracing back to Ghana. As legal changes required presidential candidates to have both parents born in Ivory Coast, Alassane left to be IMF Deputy Director General from 1994 to 1997. With a low 0.5% growth rate in <italic>West African Monetary Union</italic> since 1990, <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> halved the currency in 1994 to fuel exports. That year, <italic>West African Monetary Union</italic> transformed into <italic>West African Economic & Monetary Union</italic> to include economic integration. Through reforms, competitiveness improved, and the growth rate surged by 1997, and Guinea-Bissau joined the union. But during Ivory Coast\u2019s government coup in 1999, Thiam fled to France, where he became a partner at <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 2000. After two years, he left <italic>McKinsey</italic> for the newly formed <italic>Aviva</italic> insurer in Britain.\nFor non-protected dimensions of identity, discrimination was even more brazen. From Hinduism to Judaism, caste discrimination continued in America as it had in Eurasia, unchanged for centuries. More evocative of German militarist and 6 foot 4 tall Otto Bismarck than philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, tall men led in politics and finance. Although Amadeo Giannini, Joseph Ripley, and John Mack were around 6 feet tall and 220 pounds, he paled next to Vernon Jordan, Richard Parsons, and Tidjane Thiam, who were all 6 foot 4 inches. Despite their value, introverts suffered even in academia, where research may be expected to trump flashy self-promotion. Often more than prejudice or motivation, this preference for assertiveness led to underrepresentation in American leadership positions of Chinese and other East Asians relative to Whites, Indians, and other South Asians due to cultural differences.\nStill, America\u2019s Jewish Golden Age blossomed as Clinton\u2019s VP Al Gore and his Jewish Senator Joe Lieberman narrowly lost to Bush Jr in the 2000 Presidential election. Since 1997, Elaine Chao, the wife of Senator Mitch McConnell and most prominent Asian-American in government, asked President Clinton during an Oval Office meeting on race relations \u201c<italic>What happens when good programs in the process hurt other people.</italic>\u201d \nLike other Chinese-American immigrants, Chao emphasized self-reliance and hard work, supporting outreach and access in affirmative action, rather than racial quotas. By 2001, President Bush Jr appointed Chao Labor Secretary, making her the Cabinet\u2019s first Asian American woman. The same year, Elaine\u2019s sister Angela resigned from investment banker at <italic>Smith Barney</italic> to become SVP at her father\u2019s <italic>Foremost</italic> from 2001, using ships built in Chinese state-owned shipyards with Chinese government financing and signed long-term contracts to transport iron ore for state-owned steel makers.\nLike other <italic>McKinsey</italic> pioneers, Thiam did not leave alone, but with a team including Pierre-Olivier Bou\u00e9e. As Thiam progressively grew after <italic>Aviva</italic>, so did Bou\u00e9e. When Nancy Killefer rejoined <italic>McKinsey</italic> after three years at UST in 2000, she resumed <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s public sector practice for the first time since the <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>. Despite hesitation from management over local politics, Killefer sought to add value by connecting governments. Indeed, the global practice soon became one of the firm\u2019s fastest growing businesses. Likewise, <italic>McKinsey</italic> began advising on corporate bankruptcies after the <italic>Panic of 2001</italic>. By 2005, London-born Byron Auguste became <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s first Black director after advising on technology and innovation since 1993.\nCompared to other industrialized nations, America had a high and growing rate of bankruptcy filings as property exemptions made bankruptcy appealing to high-income households despite falling divorce and unemployment rates. Lenders, led by credit card issuers, initiated a lobbying campaign costing over $100 million to advocate for bankruptcy reform. As proposals floated, <italic>Harvard</italic> Law Professor Elizabeth Warren argued that women could lose the ability to collect on child support would if the child\u2019s father declared bankruptcy. After First Lady Hillary Clinton met with Warren, her husband President Clinton vetoed a proposed overhaul in 2000.\nSince First Hillary Clinton convinced her husband President Clinton to veto bankruptcy reform in 2000, she became Senator from New York. As creditors continued pushing for to make it harder for individuals to eliminate unsecured debts, Senator Clinton supported the bankruptcy legislation in 2001. While the legislation did not become law despite Clinton\u2019s vote, Warren, argued that Clinton\u2019s shift reflected the influence of campaign finance. However, the earliest advocate for bankruptcy reform was Delaware\u2019s Senator Joseph Biden. Since Joseph became Senator in 1972, often citing his working-class roots and implying he had fewer conflicts of interest as one of the least-wealthy members of the Senate. \nWhile Joseph Biden joined the Senate\u2019s Banking Committee, his brother James and brother-in-law John Owens collected fees, business, and unsecured loans from <italic>Farmers Bank</italic>. After a federal investigation, the relationship seems to have ended. But another started. In 1982, Maryland-based <italic>MNC Financial</italic> founded a credit card subsidiary, MBNA, in Delaware. By 1990, MBNA was <italic>MasterCard</italic>\u2019s dominant gold card issuer. Along with hiring James in 1996, MBNA recruited Joseph\u2019s son Hunter out of <italic>Yale</italic> Law. After MBNA promoted him to SVP in 1998, Hunter left for Commerce Department to work on electronic commerce. During this time, Senator Biden voted for bankruptcy reform in 1998, 2000, and 2001. As Hunter left Commerce<italic> </italic>Department in 2001, he formed a law firm, which MBNA retained for years. Likewise, Senator Biden collected millions in campaign contributions.\nAs global temperatures rose from historically low levels, scientists attributed recent climate change primarily to carbon emissions from human activities, which the global <italic>Kyoto Protocol</italic> sought to limit. As coal replaced <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s low-sulfur gas lobbying in America after the <italic>Panic of 2001</italic> and 9/11, the Bush Administration refused to join the global <italic>Kyoto Protocol</italic> against hydrocarbons. While the world\u2019s top emitter, China, released twice as much carbon as America, followed by India, primarily coal imports. America imported a great deal of the carbon load, which lifted a great amount of people out of poverty. \nAmerican gas lobbying intertwined with wealth. After <italic>Hunt</italic>, <italic>Koch</italic> became America\u2019s wealthiest private energy independent, dominating oil refining. While <italic>Koch</italic> competed with <italic>Enron</italic> in gas and derivatives, both lobbied for free market finance and jointly innovated weather derivatives. So, gas grew. <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s 1999 spin-off helped revolutionize drilling and set off a shale boom. After replacing coal as the primary source of summer electricity in 2005, gas became dominant year-round by 2015. \n<italic>Koch</italic> was heavily in the early 1970s, several Republican staffers established <italic>Heritage Foundation</italic> to promote conservative policymaking against the dominance of <italic>Brookings</italic> and other liberal-leaning think tanks. While beer heir Joseph Coors supported the <italic>Heritage Foundation</italic>, <italic>Mellon</italic> oil and banking heir Richard Mellon Scaife funded the <italic>American Enterprise Institute</italic>. Feeling that conservative think tanks did not represent libertarian ideas, the <italic>Cato</italic> <italic>Institute</italic> was founded in the mid-1970s by Edward Crane, backed by Charles Koch. Koch viewed these institutes as pivotal in influencing policy as part of a broader strategy for societal change. \nWhen David Koch unsuccessfully ran for the Libertarian Party in 1980, he called to end the prosecution of tax evaders. As Clinton\u2019s DOJ charged <italic>Koch</italic> with environmental crimes in 2000, the brothers joined family-held private businesses to lobby for lower taxes and criminal justice reform. Around the same time, money managers innovated Multi-family Offices. Targeting the ultra-affluent, numerous private family offices and wealth management firms adopting the model as traditional services profits fell.\nFollowing the  9/11 terrorist attacks American mainstream and conservatives responses focused on American victimhood and the need for military action while progressives saw them as evidence of American malignancy and the country\u2019s own victimizing nature. To address the Bush Jr Administration\u2019s \u201c<italic>supremacist ideology</italic>\u201d post-9/11 policies threatening civil rights, Soros\u2019 <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic> established a DC office in 2002 under long-term politico Morton Halperin\u2019s guidance to reform criminal justice domestically and promote democracy, inclusive growth, and multilateral collaboration globally. Within a year, as a liberal \u2018political research institute\u2019 to counter conservative think tanks, Halperin and Clinton\u2019s former Chief of Staff John Podesta launched <italic>Center for American Progress</italic> (\u201cCAP\u201d) with Soros financing. However, they failed to deny Bush Jr a second term in 2004. While no major financial services firms were among Bush Jr\u2019s top 10 supporters other than <italic>Enron</italic> in the 2000 election, banks and credit companies accounted for 6 of his top 10 career contributors in 2004, including <italic>Merrill</italic>, MBNA, CSFB, <italic>International Bank of Commerce</italic> (\u201cIBC\u201d), <italic>Goldman</italic>, and <italic>Pricewaterhouse Cooper</italic>.\nSo, another group of financiers organized to bolster Democrats. By 2006, former Clinton appointee and <italic>Citi</italic> CEO Rubin founded <italic>Hamilton Project</italic> within <italic>Brookings Institution</italic> to influencing economic policymaking within the Democratic Party on income inequality, fiscal sustainability, and healthcare access. Along with Roger Altman, a former UST Deputy Secretary and founder of <italic>Evercore</italic>, other co-founders of <italic>Hamilton Project</italic> were political neophytes, including Steven Rattner and two of Rubin\u2019s former <italic>Goldman</italic> arbitrage traders, including Eric Mindich and Richard Perry, both of whom started their own hedge funds. To lead<italic> Hamilton Project</italic>, Rubin hired Peter Orszag. While his father was a <italic>Yale </italic>mathematics professor and an extended cousin-in-law of Geroge Soros, his mother was a President and Owner of <italic>Cambridge Hydrodynamics</italic>, a research and development company in <italic>Princeton</italic>, Peter and his brother Jonathan attained PhDs in economics and soon advised UST. Jonathan later co-founded an economic litigation consultancy as Peter followed Rubin.\nLike people in general, voters rarely make entirely rational decisions. Biased beliefs about policy combined with limited understanding of the issues and politicians\u2019 strategic behavior introduces cognitive constraints. These factors affect policy outcomes, as incomplete information influences voters, decreasing the effectiveness of democratic systems. Traditionally, America\u2019s Senate has served as a counterbalance to the populist House, providing a space for deliberation and debate. Decades of legislative reforms, along with heightened ideological polarization and increased party loyalty, have impeded bipartisan cooperation. The influence of oversimplified social media and sensationalism, which has replaced traditional long-form debate with superficial soundbites and for-profit 24-hour \u2018news\u2019 entertainment channels, further exacerbates these challenges.\nAs the political industry bloated after 2004, public ideological bickering replaced back-room political compromise. While a fundamental principle of democracy emphasizes citizen equality in expressing opinions to influence representative government decisions, lobbying efforts have historically been led religious and commercial interest groups. The decline of industry regulations and the contractual freedom gained from the old systems enabled (usually uninformed) entertainers to leverage their public platforms with social media for advocacy, often aligning with liberal causes and promoting their personal brands. \nIn early 2005, <italic>Harvard</italic> President Lawrence Summers sparked controversy when he suggested at an economics conference that the underrepresentation of female scientists at elite universities might be partly attributed to \u2018innate\u2019 differences between men and women. His remarks drew criticism, with some attendees, like MIT biologist Nancy Hopkins, leaving in disgust. While some women praised his off-the-cuff speech for its academic exploration of hypotheses, others accused him of insensitivity and contributing to a hostile environment for female academics. While Summers retracted his comments, <italic>Harvard</italic> soon ousted from.\nAs creditors lobbied for consumer bankruptcy reform, the <italic>President</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Working Group</italic> (\u201cPWG\u201d) called for cross-product netting to avoid LTCM-like fire sales, and SPVs for <italic>LTV-</italic>like stay exemptions. However, 9/11 terrorist attacks delayed reforms. After investors ran from CP during the <italic>Panic of 2000</italic>, FRS pushed interest rates to a post-WWII low. Borrowing costs fell in the <italic>European Union</italic> (\u201cEU\u201d) as the north lent to the south. China led Asia in buying UST bonds to stabilize FX since the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>. Instead of issuing more <italic>public</italic> UST debt, the <italic>private</italic> sector synthesized an alternative. Along with other financial sponsors, banks sold mortgages to bankruptcy-remote SPVs. SPVs sold <italic>asset-backed</italic> CP (\u201cABCP\u201d) to MMMFs. \nOne pioneering SPV was <italic>Liquid Funding Ltd</italic>. With <italic>Bear</italic> owning 40% and high-tax payers the rest, <italic>Liquid Funding </italic>issued ABCP with a AAA rating from S&P. From 2001, Jeffrey Epstein chaired <italic>Liquid Funding</italic> following his ascent at <italic>Bear</italic>, where he joined as a junior assistant in 1976 and became a partner, thanks to his success in trading options and the endorsement of then-CEO Jimmy Cayne. While leaving <italic>Bear</italic> in 1981, he maintained a relationship through starting his own consultancy providing services to high-net worth private clients. As Epstein courted clients and influence, he began sex trafficking underage girls. \nEven without him, profits soared. While FRS increased banks\u2019 required reserves for ABCP\u2014so they would sell them off\u2014AIG insurance reduced regulatory capital. Likewise, bond insurer MBIA guaranteed subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations. ABCP demanded mortgages, and despite state litigation, the Court supported UST to broaden the mortgage base. From 2002, Georgia, Michigan, and other states tried to regulate lending practices to protect borrowers, while federal regulators like <italic>Office of Thrift Services</italic> asserted \u2018preemption\u2019, exempting AIG, <italic>Washington Mutual</italic>, <italic>IndyMac</italic>, and other institutions they oversaw from state regulations. This led to a weakening of state lending laws and a regulatory race to the bottom. Low-interest rates and oil prices led Blacks to buy real estate away from city centers in exurbia.\nDebated since 1998,  restricted consumer bankruptcy in favor of insolvency debt management plans. BA2005 converged with Europe, which were moving toward consumer dischargeable debt relief. (Within months, MBNA ended her relationship with Hunter Biden and sold-out to <italic>Bank of America </italic>for $35 billion, which more than doubled its credit-card business and became the largest issuer of <italic>Visa</italic> and <italic>MasterCard</italic> credit and debit cards in the country. As part of a deal with Senator Biden, President Bush Jr appointed Hunter Biden to the board of <italic>Amtrak</italic>, the rebranded <italic>Conrail</italic>.)\nBy reducing bankruptcy options, BA2005 accelerated foreclosures and gave residential mortgage lenders priority over creditors. So, real estate became poorer collateral for small businesses. BA2005 also implemented PWG\u2019s recommendations as the <italic>LTV</italic> court decision and SEC\u2019s post-<italic>Enron</italic> SPV changes threatened off-balance-sheet financing. BA2005 eliminated the patchwork of automatic stay exemptions and expanded the safe harbor to all securities and counterparties. \nAs collateral loan lenders gained priority over other creditors, they stopped monitoring counterparty risk. BA2005 enabled ABCP to become a safe inter-bank money alternative to UST debt, increasing the demand for and price of the underlying residential real estate. To show \u2018skin in the game,\u2019 ABCP producers held ABCP. As BA2005 applied to foreign insolvencies, European banks traded ABCP. ABCP monetization drove banks to grow sub-prime mortgage lending, quickly gaining market share from <italic>Fannie</italic>. \nAlthough ABCP mainly were subprime mortgages, rating agencies graded the diversified, BA2005-protected securitizations like safe UST debt. Broker-dealers and issuers\u2014often the same entity since the 1980s\u2014paid credit rating agencies for investment-grade ratings to hold less regulatory capital since SEC linked broker-dealer capital levels to debt credit rating in 1975. Rather than competing with private issuers, <italic>Fannie</italic> and <italic>Freddie</italic> invested in AAA-rated ABCP as the Bush Jr Administration directed her to increase low-income lending. Still, few private lenders pursued federal community reinvestment programs. Upon advice from <italic>McKinsey</italic> and <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Fannie Mae</italic> remained a GSE as the regulatory changes were deemed to not add cost.\nAlso in 2005, Congress deregulated toll road to stimulate LBO infrastructure investment and promote exurban real estate. Fending off <italic>OneUnited</italic>\u2019s takeover, Deborah Wright became Chair and CEO, as well as president, of <italic>Carver</italic> bank and a <italic>Harvard</italic> Overseer. By 2006, <italic>OneUnited</italic> made a construction loan backed by the church building to <italic>AME Church</italic> in Boston to build <italic>Roxbury Renaissance Center</italic>. The nation\u2019s oldest Black church, <italic>AME Church</italic>, established in 1818, Aligning with prominent abolitionists, <italic>AME</italic> served as a haven on the \u2018freedom trail\u2019 and a prominent advocate against the <italic>1850 Fugitive Slave Act</italic>. \nContinuing to eschew risk, FDIC criticized <italic>OneUnited</italic> soon after for not lending to lower-income residents while providing the CEO with a luxury car and residence. And, with <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s approval, <italic>Wachovia</italic> acquired California\u2019s leading S&L <italic>Golden West </italic>with legal advice from <italic>Sullivan Cromwell</italic>. (While surviving the S&L crisis, <italic>Golden West</italic>\u2019s founders were worried about subprime lending).\nReplacing PA1935, EA2005 allowed federal energy corridors\u2014to force inter-state energy transfers\u2014and allowed foreign and conglomerates to buy American PUs. As inter-state and -national PU mergers increased after 2005, protective states simulated PA1935. While federal and state merger approval times did not fall, <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s CA1990-like pollution emissions trading energy policy fell apart, and the coal-heavy <italic>Duke Energy </italic>spread into the Midwest from the South. As<italic> Berkshire </italic>expanded her energy portfolio, so did KKR. After breaking their own RJR record LBO by buying-out hospital group HCA with three other LBOs in July 2006, KKR surpassed that record in early 2007 by partnering with TPG and <italic>Goldman</italic> to acquire <italic>TXU</italic>, a Texan PU advised by<italic> Lazard</italic> and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>. \nWhile EA2005 led American farmers to substitute crops to biofuel, American BHCs and pensions ran to long-term oil and agricultural swaps and other derivatives. Likewise, China, India, and Korea bought energy assets in Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, and Africa since 2003. Amidst food inflation, international prices surged as India and Vietnam restricted exports.\nWhile the 9/11 terrorist attacks did not elevate oil prices, Congress executed the pre-9/11 energy task force recommendation to stabilize prices by invading Iraq and Afghanistan. As China and India subsidized oil, they acquired coal and oil ventures in Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, and Africa. Increased steel expenses decreased energy investment, and stagnated supply. As FRS hiked rates, Asian demand kept UST borrowing costs low. But as rates deflated housing prices, exurbs\u2014with higher driving and heating expenses\u2014also suffered energy inflation. \nAs home collateral deflated and BA2005 impeded debt reorgs, prime borrowers defaulted on underwater debts. Capital regulations forced banks to foreclose real estate investments\u2014due to BA2005\u2019s impediment on bankruptcy loans renegotiations\u2014accelerating price depreciation and mortgage defaults. Consumers also ran from transportation, squeezing manufacturers\u2014<italic>General </italic><italic>Motor</italic> and <italic>Chrysler</italic><italic> Motor</italic><italic>\u2014</italic>and<italic> </italic>airline leasers\u2014GE and AIG. By 2006, FRS <italic>New York</italic> member banks elected GE\u2019s CEO Jeffrey Immelt as a Class B Director.\nAmidst an accounting scandal at <italic>Fannie </italic>and<italic> Freddie </italic>in 2004, their regulator\u2014<italic>Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight</italic>\u2014forced Franklin Raines to retire from <italic>Fannie</italic>. For damage control, <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> William Lewis joined <italic>Freddie</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> board. As Maurice Greenberg defended AIG from SEC\u2019s disguised loss claim, DOJ\u2019s Spitzer moved on from Quattrone and threatened to apply New York\u2019s 1921 \u2018blue sky\u2019 law. Investigating AIG\u2019s deal with <italic>Berkshire</italic> (without including the latter in his inquest), Spitzer\u2019s public opinion trial forced Greenberg out. While fellow director Frank Zarb split Greenberg\u2019s Chair and CEO role with Martin Sullivan, Spitzer became New York Governor in 2007 but resigned in a prostitution scandal. \nSince retiring as Senior Director of <italic>Goldman</italic> in 1994, Stephen Friedman joined the Board in 2005 and later Risk Chair. He also chaired <italic>Stone Point Capital</italic> LBO and served as Assistant to President Bush Jr for Economic Policy and as Director of <italic>National Economic Council</italic>. As Bush appointed Friedman\u2019s successor <italic>Goldman</italic> CEO, Henry Paulson, to UST Secretary in 2006, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice headed Bush\u2019s State Department. \nLikewise, Stanley O\u2019Neal and <italic>Bain</italic>-alum Kenneth Chenault led <italic>Merrill </italic>and <italic>American Express</italic>, while Edith Cooper, Carla Harris, and Melissa James held senior roles at <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. (Harris chaired <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> <italic>Foundation</italic> from 2005.) (Stanley O\u2019Neal\u2019s cousin Rodney headed <italic>Delphi</italic> automotive and served on the board of <italic>Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co</italic> and <italic>Sprint/Nextel Corp</italic>.) While Roger Ferguson was Vice Chair of FRS, Bush promoted his wife Annette Nazareth to be SEC Commissioner in 2005. He also appointed Janet Yellen as the first woman to lead FRS <italic>San Francisco</italic> in 2004. \nUnder Hank Paulson\u2019s leadership, Lloyd Blankfein and John Thain were both considered contenders to replace him as CEO of <italic>Goldman</italic>. John Thain, from an Illinois farming town, studied electrical engineering at MIT and earned an MBA from <italic>Harvard</italic> Business in 1979 before joining <italic>Goldman</italic> that year. He rose to co-President in 2003 alongside John Thornton but left in 2004 to become CEO of the NYSE. There, Thain modernized the exchange through the merger with <italic>Archipelago</italic> and the acquisition of <italic>Euronext</italic>. \nThain\u2019s departure in 2004 cleared the way for Blankfein to succeed Paulson as CEO in 2006. Blankfein, who grew up in a working-class, predominantly Jewish public housing project in Brooklyn, attended <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Law. After starting his career at the law firm <italic>Donovan Leisure</italic>, in 1978, he shifted to finance in 1982 by joining <italic>Aron</italic>, a commodities trading firm acquired by <italic>Goldman</italic> in 1981. Soon marrying a descendant of the Katz and Meisel families, Blankfein\u2019s rose at <italic>Goldman</italic>, and later led all of fixed-income.\nAside from diversity, alums from the same connected companies continued to be in demand. Since taking <italic>BlackRock </italic>public, <italic>Merrill</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Greg Fleming fused <italic>Merrill </italic>Investment Management with Jerome Kenney into <italic>BlackRock </italic>for a 49.8% stake in 2006. Leaving <italic>Merrill</italic>,<italic> McKinsey</italic> alum James Gorman joined <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> to lead wealth management. As <italic>Goldman </italic>added <italic>McKinsey</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Rajat Gupta to the board, who started an LBO and partnered with fellow Southeast Asian, Raj Rajaratnam, <italic>Citi</italic> paid $800 million to buy Vikram Pandit\u2019s MBS-focused hedge fund by April 2007.\n<italic>Morgan </italic>also evolved. Through the <italic>Panic of 2000</italic>, Felix Rohatyn\u2019s son Nicholas was the youngest member of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s strategy group, heading the emerging markets, foreign exchange, and commodities groups, and soon establishing offices across the emerging markets. After the Clinton Administration ended, Nicolas resigned from <italic>Morgan </italic>to join his father Felix to start <italic>Rohatyn</italic>. By 2004, <italic>Morgan </italic>entered London investment banking by forming a JV with and then acquiring <italic>Cazenove, </italic>with<italic> Cazenove</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Chair David Mayhew becoming Vice Chair. With generous regulation and tax benefits since the 1980s, London had become the global derivatives hub, with connections to French-trained quants in Paris and Hong Kong. \nWhile Dina Dublon had been CFO of <italic>Morgan </italic>since the merger with <italic>Chemical</italic> NB, she retired in 2004. Instead, Blythe Masters became head of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s investment bank in 2004 and of all commodities from 2006 since innovating credit default swaps and becoming <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s youngest female director by 1995. While French-trained Jacques Aigrain left <italic>Morgan </italic>to join <italic>Swiss Re</italic> in 2001 as Head of Financial Services, he became CEO in 2006 and backed the decision to start selling and trading complex securities. (Since marrying a Katz-Gunzburg cousin, Dirk Albersmeier joined <italic>Morgan </italic>in 2005 and Headed M&A for Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.) \nIn 2003, <italic>Lehman</italic> acquired <italic>Neuberger Berman</italic>, integrating it into its global investment management division. To lead<italic> Neuberger Berman</italic>, <italic>Lehman</italic> poached <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Head of Wealth Management George Walker\u2014a cousin once removed of President Bush Jr\u2014, who opened a London office in 2005 and launched <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s first European listed fund two years later. Hiring Felix Rohatyn as senior adviser in 2006, <italic>Lehman</italic>\u2019s Richard Fuld also promoted Erin Callan. After five years as a tax attorney with <italic>Simpson Thacher</italic>, Callan joined <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1995. In 2006, Callan started the firm\u2019s <italic>Hedge Fund Investment Banking</italic> group, where she guided the IPOs of <italic>Fortress</italic>, <italic>Blackstone</italic>, and <italic>Och-Ziff</italic> as well as the first bond offering by a hedge fund for <italic>Citadel</italic>. \nBy 2007, Callan joined a handful of women who served as investment bank CFOs, including CSFB\u2019s<italic> </italic>Barbara Yastine (2002-4), <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Sallie Krawcheck (who was demoted to CFO of <italic>Citi</italic> Wealth in March 2007), and Heidi Goldberg Miller, who had led <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s treasury and security services business since CFO Dina Dublon retired in 2004. <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s 29-member Management Committee includes only three women, with meaningful influence held by just one. While CSFB had no influential women, <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s two women in upper management focus on public affairs and serve as general counsel, but none in roles that lead to CFO. Although <italic>Morgan </italic>had two top female leaders, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> had one, Wall Street\u2019s most powerful woman, co-President Zoe Cruz, Mack\u2019s presumed heir.\nWhile <italic>Lazard</italic> New York\u2019s veteran <italic>Lehman</italic> as a senior adviser in 2006, Maltese Rothschild-in-law Marcus Agius resigned as Chair of <italic>Lazard</italic> London to become Chair of a <italic>Barclay </italic>in 2007, soon becoming Chair of <italic>British Bankers</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Association</italic>, the organization overseeing the MMEU\u2019s London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLibor\u201d). Meanwhile, Libor priced off-balance-sheet debt grew.\nAlthough BA2005 protected off-balance-sheet bank financing from SEC\u2019s post-<italic>Enron</italic> regulation, SEC revoked the historical cost accounting of 1938 to harmonize with global standards. In late 2006, SEC required firms to mark their debt to market effective 2007 and lifted the uptick rule to allow shorting. Likewise, SEC merged the self-regulated NASD and NYSE\u2019s regulation into the SEC-overseen <italic>Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</italic> (\u201cFINRA\u201d) in mid-2007. \nAs counterparties and shorts refocused on market-priced assets, reporting added volatility to illiquid ABCP and other OTC debt. <italic>Goldman</italic> helped shorts underprice illiquid transactions to pull down values. As MBS constituted 15% of her $1 trillion balance sheet, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Zoe Cruz shorted sub-prime and longed prime in 2006. While <italic>Chanos</italic> shorted banks, <italic>Goldman</italic> sold credit default swaps against AIG debt to <italic>Paulson</italic> (unrelated to Henry but led by <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Mina Gerowin with funding from <italic>Soros</italic>.)\nThe <italic>Panic of 2007</italic> started in August as BNP<italic> Paribas</italic>\u2019 American MMMF was unable to price subprime ABCP and suspended redemptions. Then, amidst runs from other MMMFs, bank sponsors bailed out their MMMFs to calm investors. But as FRS reduce interest rates and unsecured debt rates fell from August, creditors increased the cost of ABCP collateral loans. As a result, financial institutions fell into a vicious cycle of selling depreciating ABCP as inventory carrying costs increased. Months after expressing optimism in an interview, <italic>Citi </italic>CEO Chuck Prince admitted significant losses on subprime mortgages. \nWhile Sandy Weill advocated Citi to replace Prince as CEO with Tim Geithner, Robert Rubin\u2019s former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 at UST, by November Rubin convinced the Board to name Vikram Pandit as CEO and to promote <italic>Citi</italic> Europe Chair Winfried Bischoff, who sold <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic>\u2019s investment bank to <italic>Citi</italic> back in 2000, as Chair. Bischoff oversaw <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s stabilization and downsizing efforts. The same month, <italic>Merrill </italic>fired Wall Street\u2019s most senior Black leader, Stanley O\u2019Neil. \nWhile rumor circulated that Wall Street\u2019s most senior Black leader, Zoe Cruz, would replace O\u2019Neil as CEO, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> fired her as the firm produced similarly dismal results. Since <italic>Merrill</italic> controlled<italic> BlackRock</italic>, <italic>BlackRock</italic> CEO Larry Fink sought to be <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s CEO, with <italic>Merrill</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Greg Fleming replacing Fink and organizing a merger with <italic>Wachovia</italic>. Instead, <italic>Goldman</italic>-alum and CEO of NYSE John Thain beat out Fink, <italic>McKinsey</italic>-alum James Gorman replaced Cruz as <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Co-President.\nBy early 2008, FRS <italic>New York</italic> member banks named <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s Risk Chair and Senior Director Stephen Friedman as Chair. In March, the new accounting rules and MMMF bailouts led the world\u2019s largest banks to collectively write down $275 billion of assets. As <italic>Bear </italic>teetered, <italic>Morgan </italic>bought <italic>Bear</italic> on March 16, with financial assistance from FRS and advice from <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Parr. \nAlso on March 16, FRS established a liquidity facility for SEC-regulated nonbanks, accepting only investment-grade collateral. As subprime losses placed bond insurer MBIA at risk. Investors, including hedge funds and major institutional investors, grew concerned that MBIA could lose her Triple-A rating. While MBIA suspended new structured finance business and stopped issuing credit derivative insurance forom February 2008, SEC reported that conflicts of interest biased ABCP ratings. SEC banned financial stock naked short sales, but the order expired. \nAmidst March losses, <italic>Liquid Funding</italic> to replace Jeffrey Epstein. (Through his <italic>Bear</italic> affiliations, he soon courted tax-avoidant wealthy investors through a relationship with <italic>Morgan</italic>.) At <italic>O</italic><italic>ffice of Thrift Supervision</italic>\u2019s behest, <italic>Washington Mutual</italic> turned to TPG. After pioneering the good bank/bad bank model to buy <italic>American Savings Bank</italic> during the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>, David Bonderman had sold <italic>American Savings Bank</italic> to <italic>Washington Mutual </italic>in 1996. While Bonderman sat on <italic>Washington Mutual</italic>\u2019s board until 2002, he rejoined as TPG invested into the bank. Likewise, Texan oil magnate Robert Bass and John Grayken\u2019s <italic>Lone Star Funds</italic>\u2014who worked with TPG in Korea after Asia\u2019s <italic>Panic of 1997</italic> and in America before that\u2014bought nearly $31 billion in distressed mortgage securities from <italic>Merrill </italic>for $6.2 billion, one of the largest distressed asset acquisitions of the era.\nAfter announcing more losses in June, Wall Street\u2019s then-most senior woman, CFO Erin Callan, resigned from<italic> Lehman </italic>as the firm searched for a buyer with <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s help. As ABCP collateral loans grew, prime ABCP values fell. In July, <italic>Office of Thrift Supervision</italic> shuttered <italic>IndyMac Bank</italic>, which was taken over by FDIC, while depositors ran from<italic> Washington Mutual</italic>, prompting FHLB <italic>San Francisco</italic> to limit her borrowing capacity and leading <italic>Office of Thrift Supervision</italic> to issue further downgrades. \nBy September, UST nationalized <italic>Fannie</italic> and <italic>Freddie</italic>, with <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Ken Parr involved in restructuring efforts for these entities. Meanwhile, UST Secretary Hank Paulson hired Kendrick Wilson, a former <italic>Lazard</italic> executive, as an adviser. Since FRS could only assist solvent banks due to restrictions under FA1932, she did not discount for AIG. As the situation worsened, <italic>Morgan </italic>demanded $8 billion in collateral from <italic>Lehman</italic>, which soon sought bankruptcy protection on September 15.\nOf <italic>Lehman </italic>HC\u2019s (\u201cLBHC\u201d) many subsidiaries, her American (\u201cLBA\u201d) and London-domiciled European (\u201cLBE\u201d) securities firms were the largest, but did not segregate accounts. One reason was that London\u2019s lenient margin rules allowed American hedge funds to finance trades more cheaply than they could in New York. Before LBHC filed for bankruptcy, American regulators transferred funds from LBE to LBA. As German regulators issued a moratorium for her local subsidiary, British regulators placed LBE into administration to stay settlement. \nHong Kong and other jurisdictions similarly ringfenced assets to favor local clients. When LBHC filed for bankruptcy, SEC and FRS assisted LBA in selling healthy assets American assets to <italic>Barclay</italic> and foreign assets <italic>Nomura</italic>, as LBHC retained liabilities. While LBHC retained derivatives and collateralized loans exempt from stays per BA2005, counterparties fire-sold OTC collateral. After <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Parr advised <italic>Barclay</italic> and LBA, he advised LBHC in bankruptcy. On the legal side, <italic>Weil Gotshal</italic> advised in the bankruptcies of long-term clients <italic>Lehman</italic> (since 1983) and, soon after, <italic>General </italic><italic>Motor</italic>.\n<italic>Lehman</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s ABCP default triggered runs from MMMFs\u2014forcing the oldest MMMF to \u2018break the buck\u2019 by selling below the NAV\u2014and ABCP credit generally froze, impairing counterparties, AIG, and spreading to the automotive, airline, and other industries. Although UST lawyers held that UST\u2019s <italic>Exchange Stabilization Fund</italic> (\u201cESF\u201d) could not be used for individual rescues of <italic>Bear </italic>or AIG. However, shortly thereafter, UST decided to use it to stabilize the MMMF industry. \nTo mitigate the financial system\u2019s turmoil and prevent outflows, on September 19, UST introduced a guarantee program for money market funds, akin to deposit insurance for banks. President George Bush Jr endorsed the use of ESF for up to $50 billion to assure payments for eligible MMMFs. Along with facilities to buy MBS and discount CP, FRS swapped FX with global central banks to allow foreigners access to <italic>dollars</italic>, although they denied India access.\nAs <italic>Lehman </italic>filed for bankruptcy, FRS prevented contagion by sponsoring <italic>Bank of America</italic>\u2019s <italic>Merrill </italic>purchase and forcefully nationalizing AIG using expropriated equity as collateral. Unlike private negotiations or bankruptcy, FRS fully paid AIG\u2019s counterparties in a <italic>Goldman</italic> trade on behalf of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>. Still, six months since TPG invested into <italic>Washington Mutual </italic>in March, <italic>Washington Mutual</italic>\u2019s bankruptcy set a long-time failure record.\nBy then, FBI arrested <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s <italic>McKinsey</italic>-alum Rajat Gupta for passing insider information to Rajaratnam. Still, UST Secretary Henry Paulson oversaw taxpayer-funded bailouts involving his <italic>Goldman</italic> associates. While former UST Secretary Robert Rubin\u2019s <italic>Citi</italic> received aid, <italic>Goldman</italic> alumni assumed leadership across Wall Street, including John Thain at <italic>Merrill</italic>, Robert Steel at <italic>Wachovia</italic>, and Ed Liddy at AIG. Along with advising UST and FRS <italic>New York</italic> on <italic>Bear</italic> and AIG assets, <italic>BlackRock</italic> FMA managed the vehicles. \nAfter <italic>Bank of America</italic> sold <italic>Merrill</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s stake in <italic>Bloomberg</italic>, AIG sold her stake in <italic>Blackstone</italic> and, with <italic>Blackstone</italic>\u2019s advice, many insurance subsidiaries to repay her UST debt. While Rubin withdrew from <italic>Citi</italic> to advise Obama in 2008, he was forced to resign after <italic>Citi</italic> required a bailout due to his risk-taking policies. At the same time, <italic>Citi</italic> sold <italic>Smith Barney</italic> to <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. After Gorman replaced Mack as CEO of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, Greg Fleming joined with<italic> Merrill</italic> bankers fleeing <italic>Bank of America</italic>.\nAs SEC banned naked shorting for all stocks and temporarily prohibited financial stock shorting, FRS broadened her discount facility, and sought to force sales of the remaining SEC-regulated investment banks, <italic>Goldman </italic>and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. FRS allowed them to convert into FRS-supervised BHCs after and <italic>Mitsubishi</italic> invested <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> and Buffet\u2019s <italic>Berkshire </italic>bought equity in <italic>Goldman </italic>and<italic> </italic>GE. And by month\u2019s end, SEC clarified that firms could use model estimates instead of market prices to value distressed assets. Aside from Henry Paulson, Ben Bernanke, and Timothy Geithner at UST, FRS, and FRS <italic>New York</italic>, <italic>Sullivan Cromwell </italic>Chair Rodgin Cohen played a primary role in bank bailouts, mergers, and cash infusions, advising on 17 deals through 2009, including <italic>Fannie Mae</italic>, <italic>Lehman</italic>, <italic>Wachovia</italic>, <italic>Barclay</italic>, AIG, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and <italic>Goldman</italic>.\nAlong with the collapse of housing market securities, bank profits fell as FRS continued reducing interest rates since 2007, reaching a 50 year low by October. That month, Congress enacted the <italic> </italic>(\u201cEESA\u201d). Although she had scheduled to permit FRS to pay interest on excess reserves in 2011, EESA moved up the date to allow FRS to sterilize against inflation as she bought ABCP. And while private firms left the ABCP, <italic>Fannie</italic> and <italic>Freddie</italic> joined FRS to buy securities to stabilize banks and real estate. EESA<italic> </italic>authorized $700 billion for UST to raise liquidity by purchasing ABCP and other distressed assets. While UST used some funds to modify mortgages, they disbursed most of the $443 billion funds to financial institutions\u2014mainly AIG and <italic>Citi</italic>\u2014and automotive manufacturers. Although Congress likely intended greater judicial review, UST still recouped over 90% of the loans.\nAs <italic>OneUnited</italic> suffered, former director Sidney Williams\u2019 wife, California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, organized a meeting with federal regulators to aid MWO banks. During the meeting, <italic>OneUnited</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> CEO, requested $50 million bailout, despite its financial issues and past regulatory criticism for not lending to lower-income residents. By late 2008, <italic>OneUnited</italic> received EESA funds. While EESA and big-bank funds saved <italic>Carver Bank</italic> in Harlem, a big-bank consortium took over <italic>ShoreBank</italic>\u2019s Chicago CDFI after UST denied funds. Both lost their Black-ownership status, as did Maggie Walker\u2019s <italic>Consolidated Bank & Trust</italic> (1903). Another EESA recipient was America\u2019s largest Hispanic-owned bank, <italic>International Bank of Commerce</italic> (\u201cIBC\u201d). In general, politically-engaged firms were more likely to receive EESA funds, and do so in earlier and in greater amounts than other firms.\nBy late 2008, as America\u2019s fourth largest BHC<italic> Wachovia</italic> reeled from subprime losses of <italic>Golden West Financial</italic>, she sold herself to <italic>Wells Fargo</italic>. While <italic>SunTrust</italic> sold 9% of her <italic>Coca Cola</italic> shares in May 2007 for $60 million, her credit reserves fell below nonperforming loans by 2008, along with other banks. As FDIC closed failed banks and sold assets to solvent institutions like <italic>SunTrust</italic>, investor confidence grew. \nAmidst continued economic decline, <italic>SunTrust</italic> sold $3.5 billion in preferred stock to EESA. But even that was not enough and soon increased. After failing part of FRS\u2019 stress test in 2012, Atlanta-based <italic>SunTrust Bank</italic> sold long-held <italic>Coca Cola</italic> shares, increased mortgage repurchase reserves, and wrote down underperforming loans and properties to comply with regulations and improve the bank\u2019s capital position amidst concerns about loan performance.\nWhen California S&L <italic>IndyMac Bank</italic> failed in July 2008, FDIC assumed control and sought buyers for the institution. In early 2009, FDIC sold <italic>IndyMac</italic> to a syndicate including <italic>Paulson</italic>, <italic>Dune Capital</italic>, and Michael Dell\u2019s MSD<italic> Capital</italic>. Steve Mnuchin, who became CEO of the restructured <italic>IndyMac</italic>, became <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s CIO on Management Committee before briefly managing <italic>Soros</italic>\u2019 <italic>SFM Capital</italic> in 2004. He later co-founded <italic>Dune Capital</italic> with fellow <italic>Goldman</italic> alumni, with <italic>Soros</italic> as an early investor. While Mnuchin\u2019s father earlier led <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s trading floor, his brother banked at <italic>Bear</italic> and <italic>Lehman</italic> before founding advisory firm, AGM<italic> Partners</italic>. \nAlthough Angela Merkel became Germany\u2019s first female head of state in 2005, woman led only half a dozen of the 192 sovereign states in 2010. By rising on her own merit, Merkel mirrored Israel\u2019s Golda Meir, who preceded female leaders that were part of elite political dynasties, including Sirimavo Bandaranaike, Indira Nehru, Isabel Peron, Benazir Bhutto, and Sheikh Hasina. As women had cracked the glass ceiling in Lebanon in 2004, all were political heiresses as sexism continued to limit opportunities. \nSince Sheikh Rahman founded <italic>Awami League </italic>and won Bangladesh\u2019s independence in 1971, he was assassinated in 1975. Of unknown relation, Ziaur Rahman founded <italic>Bangladesh Nationalist Party</italic> (\u201cBNP\u201d) in 1978. After Ziaur was assassinated in 1981, his wife Khaleda entered politics and became Chair in 1984. Meanwhile, Sheikh\u2019s daughter Sheikh Hasina returned to Bangladesh in 1981 and became Head of <italic>Awami League</italic>. Both Sheikh and Rahman opposed Hussain Ershad\u2019s regime in the 1980s, leading to his resignation in 1990. \nIn the 1991 election, BNP won, and Khaleda became PM, with Hasina as opposition leader. In 1996, Khaleda resigned, and <italic>Awami League</italic> won the election, making Hasina PM. BNP won a landslide victory in 2001, and Khaleda returned as PM. Hasina survived an assassination attempt in 2004. Khaleda\u2019s term ended in 2006 amid corruption charges. During the caretaker government period from 2006 to 2008, both Sheikh and Rahman were jailed. <italic>Awami League</italic> won the 2008 election, and Hasina became PM in 2009. Only after weeks of protests and the imprisonment of Khaleda did Hasina resign in 2024.\nLikewise in America, Nancy Alesandro Pelosi became the first female Speaker of the House in 2007. Her father, a notable political figure, held five terms in Congress and completed three mayoral terms in Baltimore before her brother took on the presidency of the city council. She wed a fellow Italian Catholic, whose San Francisco pharmacist father amassed wealth with a concession for the 1960 Olympics.\nWhile former President Bill Clinton\u2019s wife, Hillary, started strong in the Democratic primaries, she lost to Senator Barack Obama. And despite an initial surge, Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin\u2019s popularity declined along with the Republican-led economy. So, America elected her first Black President. Among other factors, Obama benefited from the support of Valerie Jarrett, a cousin of MIT\u2019s first Black graduate Robert Taylor, like<italic> Lazard</italic>\u2019s Vernon Jordan\u2019s wife. Jarrett later served as Director of the <italic>Office of Public Engagement</italic> and <italic>Intergovernmental Affairs</italic>. Having led <italic>Hyatt</italic>\u2019s <italic>Classic Residence</italic> and developed the <italic>Hyatt Center</italic> in Chicago, Penny Pritzker served as Obama\u2019s national finance Chair in 2008 campaign and co-Chair for his 2012 race. She served in his Cabinet as his Commerce Secretary form 2013. Obama appointed Susan Rice\u2014whose father Emmett Rice served on FRS\u2019s Board in the 1980s as the second Black director\u2014as America\u2019s Ambassador to UN  and then National Security Advisor.\nTo run his transition, Obama tapped Clinton\u2019s former Chief of Staff and <italic>Center for American Progress</italic> (\u201cCAP\u201d) -co-founder John Podesta. (John Podesta\u2019s brother Anthony continued to lobbying via <italic>Podesta,</italic> which became one of DC\u2019s most profitable firms.) Since Roger Ferguson resigned as FRS Vice Chair in 2006 and <italic>Time Warner</italic> replaced Richard Parsons as CEO in 2007, President-Elect Obama appointed these Black executives to his <italic>Transition Economic Advisory Board</italic> in 2008. \nFerguson subsequently served on the President\u2019s <italic>Economic Recovery Advisory Board</italic> before becoming CEO and President of TIAA-CREF asset management. Since Ferguson\u2019s wife Annette Nazareth became SEC Commissioner in 2005, she rejoined <italic>Davis Polk</italic> in 2008, advising major banks and securities firms in crafting regulation. While Nazareth stated that \u2018<italic>I am not a door-opener; I am a substantive lawyer</italic>\u2019, her emails to SEC officials reveal how lawyers exploit government connections for client access.\nFor automotives, ESSA required Obama to appoint a Car Tsar to report to UST. Obama appointed Steven Rattner, formerly of <italic>Lazard</italic>, to use transparent bankruptcy courts for LBHC-like asset transfers. By 2009, <italic>Chrysler</italic> named a <italic>McKinsey</italic> alum Robert Kidder CEO. Shortly after SEC merged NASD and NYSE Regulation into <italic>Financial Industry Regulatory Authority</italic> (\u201cFINRA\u201d) in 2007, NASD co-founder Bernard Madoff exposed his two-decade Ponzi scheme in late 2008 and later died in prison. \nAs <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Parr advised on the sale of Madoff\u2019s trading business, and banks hired from <italic>McKinsey</italic>. While Ron O\u2019Hanley joined <italic>Fidelity</italic>, sharing leadership duties with Abigail Johnson, Ian Davis joined the boards of <italic>British Petroleum</italic>, <italic>Johnson & Johnson</italic>, and <italic>Apax </italic>LBO, co-founded by Ronald Cohen in the 1970s after two-years at<italic> McKinsey</italic>. \nDue to his to<italic> Goldman</italic>, former Senior Director Stephen Friedman resigned from FRS <italic>New York</italic> in May 2009. Still, <italic>Goldman</italic> reinforced links with governments. By 2008, <italic>Goldman</italic> hired Dina Habib from the State Department. Born to a Coptic Egyptian family in Cairo, Habib moved with her family to Texas in 1977. She graduated from <italic>Uni of Texas</italic> at Austin and began her political career with an internship for Senator Kay Hutchison. In 2003, she became the youngest-ever Assistant to the President under President Bush. \nBy 2005, she was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Educational & Cultural Affairs, where she used her Arabic skills to strengthen American relations in the Middle East. At <italic>Goldman</italic>, Habib led <italic>Goldman </italic><italic>Foundation</italic>, overseeing the <italic>10,000 Women</italic> initiative, which launched in March 2008 with a $100 million commitment to assist female-led businesses in developing countries. She also directed the <italic>10,000 Small Businesses</italic> initiative, launched in response to public criticism amidst the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, with a $500 million pledge to support small businesses in America and Britain.\nWhile litigating with SEC over ABCP,<italic> Goldman</italic> hired Arthur Levitt as a policy adviser in from 2009 until retiring in 2014 at 84. The former partner of Sandy Weill and Frank Zarb served as Clinton\u2019s SEC Chair from 1993 to 2001. (Hiring Levitt\u2019s former SEC aide Russell Horwitz in 2004, <italic>Goldman</italic> made him partner in 2012.) By then, <italic>Goldman</italic> alumni corralled international finance. Additionally, various other <italic>Goldman</italic> alumni have held influential positions in global financial institutions, such <italic>FRS</italic> New York, the Canadian and Italian national banks, <italic>BANK</italic>, and NYSE. \nAlthough European investment continued harmonizing since 2000, it stopped as trust broke down with <italic>Lehman</italic>. During the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, local central banks within EU could not use monetary policy as part of a currency union to refinance banks within their borders. Unlike the United States of America, Europe had neither a federal bankruptcy option nor fiscal integration to distribute automatic stabilizers. (While northern Europe had moved towards debt relief since 1989, southern countries retained rigid bankruptcy.) Moreover, fears of uneven growth sapped liquidity, spurring bank bailout and sovereign default concerns. \nAfter selling her Monaco branch to Italy\u2019s BCI\u2019s Enrico Braggiotti in 2006, a London-domiciled activist hedge fund forced Dutch ABN<italic> </italic>AMRO to split up in 2007. Advised by <italic>Lehman</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, UBS and <italic>Goldman</italic>, ABN AMRO sold her American <italic>LaSalle</italic> BHC to <italic>Bank of America</italic> and agreed to a friendly buyout by <italic>Barclay</italic>, which retained <italic>Lazard</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Cazenove</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>. After a consortium of Spanish <italic>Santander</italic>, British RBS, and Belgian <italic>Fortis</italic> made a higher unsolicited joint bid for ABN<italic> </italic>AMRO, <italic>Barclay</italic> withdrew from the race. Keeping ABN<italic> </italic>AMRO <italic>Brazil</italic>, <italic>Santander</italic> sold the Italian retail banks. \nWhile <italic>Santander </italic>soon bought more British banks, ABN<italic> </italic>AMRO\u2019s subprime holdings depleted her partners\u2019 equity. As Britain injected equity and nationalized RBS, public backlash led her CEO Fred Goodwin to resign. Similarly, a Belgian and Dutch bailouts dispute led<italic> </italic>to the resignation of <italic>Fortis</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> CEO, splitting off by country. As <italic>Paribas</italic> took over Belgian assets, <italic>Lazard</italic> advised the Ministry and the central bank of the Netherlands on nationalizing Dutch assets. Since former BOE Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton\u2019s son James advised <italic>Barclay</italic>, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> promoted head to lead her London operations in mid-2008. By 2009, RBS appointed Philip Hampton\u2014who had parlayed a decade at <italic>Lazard</italic> London into a <italic>Lloyd</italic> TSB directorship and then chairmanship of supermarket chain <italic>Sainsbury</italic>\u2014to become Chair.\n<italic>Swiss R</italic>e suffered major losses due to investments and exposure to AIG and <italic>Lehman</italic>, resulting in a large loss. Weakness in America\u2019s <italic>dollar</italic> further impacted profits, leading <italic>Swiss Re</italic> to turn to <italic>Berkshire Hathaway</italic> for investment in February 2009. Soon after, <italic>Swiss Re</italic>\u2019s CEO Jacques Aigrain and Board Chair Peter Forstmoser resigned, replaced by insider deputy Stefan Lippe and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s Board Chair Walter Kielholz. Amidst the crisis, <italic>Commerzbank</italic> promoted <italic>McKinsey</italic>-alum Martin Blessing to CEO, who then steered the acquisition of <italic>Dresdner Bank</italic> in September 2008, doubling the bank\u2019s client base.\nIn late 2008, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> of Cologne became the largest shareholder of retailer <italic>Arcandor</italic> after injecting capital. After failing to secure a state loan guarantee, <italic>Arcandor</italic> filed for bankruptcy in 2009. By 2010, Europe\u2019s largest private bank, <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, faced financial difficulties, and was taken over by <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> in a rescue deal. Shortly after the takeover, German state prosecutors opened an investigation into former managers of <italic>Oppenheim</italic> for suspected breaches of trust related to the bank\u2019s dealings with <italic>Arcandor</italic>.\nAmid the crisis, <italic>Exchequer</italic> pressured and partly nationalized<italic> Lloyd</italic> Bank to take over the troubled <italic>Bank of Scotland</italic>, curbing <italic>Scottish National Party</italic>\u2019s financial sector ambitions at the same time. Winfried Bischoff left nationalized <italic>Citi</italic> to Chair <italic>Lloyd</italic> in 2009. He faced criticism for not changing the CEO before he understood the company. When <italic>Exchequer</italic> appointed <italic>Santander</italic>\u2019s Antonio Horta-Osorio CEO in 2011, Bischoff faced a different challenge when Horta-Osorio left due to exhaustion. However, with support, Horta-Osorio returned to his role. Bischoff retired in 2014 at 72, and became Chair of <italic>Morgan </italic>Europe and Britain\u2019s <italic>Financial Reporting Council</italic>, at which he faced criticism for weak audits until retiring in 2019.\nAmidst the crisis, Britain elected Conservative opposition leader, David Cameron as PM. While Cameron\u2019s aristocratic Christian forefathers had led HSBC and <italic>Panmure Gordon</italic>, his rabbinical Jewish ancestors Levita led <italic>Chartered Bank of India, Australia, & China</italic>. While Republican Congressman Eric Cantor of South Carolina became the first Jew to lead a chamber of Congress in America, President Obama promoted Janet Yellen from the first woman to lead FRS <italic>San Francisco</italic> to FRS Vice Chair in 2010. \nDuring this time, women chaired central banks in countries including Honduras, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand, Paraguay, Kenya, South Africa, and Bahamas. Amidst the crisis, Christine Largarde became the first female head of IMF in 2011. Around this time, Dutch-national Neelie Kroes, EC Competition Commissioner, often repeated the sexist and false claim that \u201c<italic>Lehman Sisters would not have failed</italic>\u201d, advocating for more women on boards and banks to reduce risk (After her term, Kroes became a Special Advisor for <italic>Bank of America</italic> by 2015). \nHowever, as ECB attempted to remain politically independent, it started a run to safe German debt from Ireland and southern Europe in 2010. Since <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s former CEO Jon Corzine left to serve as New Jersey\u2019s governor, he re-entered finance to lead MF Global, making a $6 billion bet on Italian government bonds that ultimately led to the firm\u2019s collapse in late 2011, resulting in one of the largest bankruptcies in US history. Many central bankers strong had ties to <italic>Goldman</italic>.\nSince <italic>Goldman</italic>-alum Mark Carney led <italic>Bank of Canada</italic> from 2008 to 2013, he headed BOE from 2013. As <italic>Goldman</italic>-alum Mario Draghi became President of ECB and Lucas Papademos, who bought cross-currency swaps from <italic>Goldman</italic> as the former head of Greece\u2019s <italic>Central Bank</italic>, became PM of Greece. Austerity measures were enforced by new technocratic governments in Greece, Italy, and Ireland, supported by IMF and <italic>European Financial Stability Facility</italic>. Likewise, Peter Sutherland, former head of <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>British arm, advised on Ireland\u2019s financial matters. While <italic>Lazard</italic> advised Greece as her exit from the <italic>euro</italic> loomed, political crisis led to a regime change. Having advised Ireland\u2019s central bank, <italic>BlackRock</italic> FMA advised Greece on bank reorg. \nStill, political cross-border bank bailouts threatened EU\u2019s stability until  vowed to support the <italic>euro </italic>in 2012. While BOE had no female monetary policy makers since 2010, German Claudia Buch became a GBB VP on by 2014, succeeding Sabine Lautenschlaeger who joined the ECB Board. Since leaving <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>for the Greek Parliament with the New Democracy party in 2007, Kyriakos Mitsotakis became the Minister of Administrative Reform and e-Governance in 2013, focusing on downsizing the public sector, reforming tax administration, and reducing bureaucracy in government. In 2015, he became the first-ranking parliamentary representative of New Democracy, and in 2016, he was elected as the President of New Democracy. In 2019, he became the PM of Greece.\nWhile <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s investment bank co-heads Bill Winters and Steve Black had overseen integration of <italic>Bear</italic>, head of Money Management Jes Staley, a <italic>Morgan </italic>veteran since 1979, dealt with <italic>Bear</italic><italic></italic><italic>-</italic>affiliated private banker Jeffrey Epstein. In September 2009, <italic>Morgan </italic>initiated leadership changes to groom successors for Jamie Dimon. As Staley became CEO of the investment bank, head of the Private Bank Mary Callahan replaced him, becoming head of Asset & Wealth Management and joining the Operating Committee. Despite continuing commodity losses stemming from Blythe Masters\u2019 coal bets, Staley and Dimon supported her. Not wanting to wait for Vikram Pandit to retire, Ajay Banga left <italic>Citi</italic> to lead <italic>MasterCard</italic> in 2010. Following his brother, Manvinder left <italic>Unilever</italic> to join LBO firm <italic>Clayton Dubilier Rice</italic>. \nAs the elitist-banker oligarchy continued in America, DOJ and SEC began enforcing the <italic>Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977</italic>. Creating a corrupt practices unit in 2010, SEC investigated <italic>Morgan </italic>for employing the children of Chinese officials to gain business by 2013. But although Congress passed weak rules to limit lobbying by relatives of lawmakers, the practices continued.\nKKR, along with <italic>Blackstone</italic> and TPG, faced allegations of collusion to manipulate corporate takeover prices. The legal dispute concluded in 2014 with a settlement, requiring the firms to pay a combined $325 million without admitting wrongdoing. Anti-business sentiment also fueled antitrust. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, competition regulators from America to Britain investigated collusion and manipulation of benchmark interbank rates. Starting with MMEU\u2019s London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLibor\u201d) in 2008, <italic>Barclay</italic> faced a leadership crisis in 2012 following revelations of manipulating the Libor. Rothschild-in-law and former <italic>Lazard</italic> London Chair and Marcus Agius, who had been Chair since 2007, resigned, as did CEO Robert Diamond. David Walker, a former BOE official, was appointed as the new chairman to lead the bank\u2019s recovery efforts and restore governance amid regulatory scrutiny. \nDOJ extended to FX, swaps, and the London gold and silver price fixes, including<italic> Barclay</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, and <italic>Bank of Nova Scotia</italic>, and <italic>Deutsche</italic>. As banks settled claims totaling billions of <italic>dollars</italic> from 2013, exchanges began overseeing accredited brokers. For precious metals, the <italic>Intercontinental Exchange</italic> oversaw fifteen brokers, including British banks (HSBC, <italic>Standard Chartered</italic>, <italic>Toronto Dominion</italic>); London branches of American banks (<italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, <italic>Goldman</italic>); Chinese banks (<italic>Bank of China</italic> and ICBC), hedge funds (<italic>Jane Street, </italic>DRW), and commodities brokers (<italic>Koch</italic>, <italic>Marex</italic>). But while Western nations sold gold for FRS <italic>dollars</italic>, central banks from China, oil producers, and sanctioned countries bought more. And since derivatives collapsed after the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic> in the West, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> continued innovating, particularly growing in Asia out of Korea.<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of 2020 & 2023</italic>\nAfter leaving <italic>Bain </italic>and <italic>Disney</italic>, Meg Whitman led a children\u2019s shoe manufacturer and <italic>Florists Transworld Delivery </italic>before <italic>eBay</italic> recruited her as CEO to lead their IPO via <italic>Goldman</italic> in 1998. Also that year, Max Levchin, hailing from Ukraine with a playwright father and physicist mother, entered the tech industry. After completing a PhD at <italic>Uni of Illinois</italic>, he collaborated with <italic>Stanford</italic> Law graduate Peter Thiel to pioneer a wireless money transfer system that evolved into <italic>PayPal</italic>, recruiting their associates at <italic>Univ of Illinois</italic> and <italic>Stanford</italic>, and gaining investment from <italic>Sequoia</italic> VC. However, growth was sluggish until Elon Musk acquired <italic>PayPal</italic> in 2000 as part of his online banking project and marketed aggressively. This strategic move propelled <italic>PayPal</italic> to prominence as the preferred payment method for online auction transactions on <italic>eBay</italic>, leading to its acquisition by <italic>eBay</italic> in 2002.\nIn the aftermath of the <italic>eBay</italic> acquisition, <italic>PayPal</italic> alumni rose to prominence. Elon Musk, for instance, founded <italic>SpaceX</italic> in 2002 and later took the reins at <italic>Tesla </italic><italic>Motor</italic> in 2008. Seeding <italic>Palantir Technologies</italic> and <italic>Facebook</italic> in 2004, Peter Thiel founded <italic>Founders Fund</italic> in 2005. Max Levchin co-founded <italic>Affirm</italic>, offering \u2018buy now, pay later\u2019 credit. Other notable members include Reid Hoffman, co-founder of <italic>LinkedIn</italic> (later acquired by <italic>Microsoft</italic>), Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, co-founders of <italic>Yelp</italic>, Premal Shah, who became President of small-business lender <italic>Kiva</italic>, Jeff Jordan, who became the CEO of <italic>OpenTable</italic>, and David Sacks, founder of <italic>Geni.com</italic> and <italic>Yammer</italic> (with the latter being sold to <italic>Microsoft</italic>). \nAdditionally, Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim founded <italic>YouTube</italic> in 2005, with support from <italic>PayPal</italic> alumnus Roelof Botha, who joined <italic>Sequoia Capital</italic> and invested in platforms like <italic>YouTube</italic>,<italic> Instagram</italic>, and <italic>Tumblr</italic> and which were acquired by <italic>Google</italic>, <italic>Facebook</italic>, and <italic>Yahoo</italic>. By 2010, after <italic>Netscape</italic>\u2019s founder Marc Andreessen\u2019s VC <italic>Andreessen Horowitz</italic> funded <italic>Twitter</italic> in 2006, he joined Thiel and <italic>Sequoia</italic> to fund <italic>Stripe</italic>, an online payment processor that eliminated the need for separate merchant accounts like <italic>PayPal</italic>. As <italic>eBay</italic> and <italic>PayPal</italic> lost share to <italic>Amazon</italic> and <italic>Stripe</italic>, <italic>eBay</italic> spun off <italic>PayPal</italic> as a standalone entity in 2015.\nHowever, <italic>Palantir</italic> struggled to raise capital until Alex Karp became CEO in 2005. Karp, the son of a Jewish father and Black mother, grew up in Philadelphia and earned a PhD in neoclassical social theory from <italic>Uni of Frankfurt</italic> before making a fortune managing an investment fund that he launched with inheritance money. Following a successful demonstration, <italic>Palantir</italic> raised funds from CIA, <italic>Allen</italic>, <italic>Reed Elsevier</italic>, and <italic>SAC Capital</italic>. Under Karp\u2019s leadership, <italic>Palantir</italic> landed more government contracts\u2014especially after 9/11\u2014making Karp one of the richest Black Americans by the 2020s.\nMeanwhile, India continued growing. Since <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>collapse in the <italic>Panic of 2000</italic>, Indian PU subsidizes grew. When energy inflation spread to crops, America\u2019s EA2005 accelerated food inflation since farmers substituted crops for biofuel. India stabilized domestic prices with disruptive export bans. Born within the Hindu mercantile <italic>bania</italic> caste, Indian tycoon Gautam Adani took a significant step into the electricity sector in 2009 by securing approval from India\u2019s power and coal ministries to construct a power plant in Maharashtra state with permission to develop a coal mine. In the 1980s, Adani began as an import-export trader in Mumbai with trade being heavily regulated by the government. \nAs India embarked on economic reforms in the 1990s, Adani expanded his trading business<italic> Adani</italic>. Since Chief Minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi presided over riots that claimed a thousand, mostly Muslim lives in 2002, he established a close relationship <italic>Adani</italic> and others, including tax concessions and regulatory advantages. While America\u2019s State Department revoked Modi\u2019s visa in 2005 for his handling of the riots, Modi became PM in 2014, and sold-out <italic>Madison Square Garden</italic>, to a mostly Brahmin audience. In India, <italic>Adani </italic>thrived and continuing, expanding into airports, ports, cement, and warehouses. So did other <italic>bania</italic>, including <italic>Reliance Industries</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> Mukesh and Anil Ambani, the Marwari <italic>Aditya Birla</italic>\u2019s Kumar Birla, <italic>Bharti</italic>\u2019s Sunil Mittal, <italic>Essar</italic>\u2019s Shashi and Ravi Ruia, <italic>Jindal</italic>\u2019s Savitri Jindal, and <italic>ArcelorMittal</italic>\u2019s Lakshmi Mittal. \nThe son of a small steel mill owner in India, Lakshmi Mittal started with a small mill in Indonesia in 1975. In the early 1990s, he bought low-cost steelmakers, including Mexico\u2019s <italic>Sicarsta</italic>, Trinidad & Tobago\u2019s national company, and Canada\u2019s <italic>Sidbec-Dosco</italic>. By 1996, Mittal expanded to include the Kazakhstan government\u2019s <italic>Karmet</italic>, Hamburg\u2019s state-owned steel mill, and Ireland\u2019s sole steel mill. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, Mittal spun-off <italic>Ispat</italic> in the world\u2019s largest steel IPO to raise funds while retaining control. As Mittal bought <italic>Inland Steel</italic> and entered America, his son Aditya graduated <italic>Wharton</italic> and headed <italic>Mittal</italic>\u2019s M&A. By <italic>Mittal</italic> bought Algerian <italic>Alfasid</italic>, Czech <italic>Nowa Huta</italic>, Polish <italic>Polskie Huty Stali</italic>, and Macedonian <italic>Balkan Steel</italic> the early 2000s. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Usinor</italic> bought <italic>J&L Specialty</italic> in America, <italic>Cockerill-Sambre</italic> in Belgium, and two Brazilian companies. In 2002, <italic>Usinor </italic>merged with <italic>Arbed</italic> and <italic>Aceralia </italic>to create European leader<italic> Arcelor</italic>. Not to be outdone, <italic>Mittal</italic> acquired <italic>Bethlehem Steel</italic>\u2019s <italic>International Steel</italic> in 2004, becoming the world\u2019s second-largest steel company, and the largest in America. By 2006, <italic>Mittal </italic>and <italic>Arcelor </italic>merged into <italic>ArcelorMittal</italic>. Acquiring <italic>Uttam Galva</italic> in 2009, <italic>ArcelorMittal </italic>entered India. As <italic>Arcelor Mittal</italic> became the largest global steel producer, <italic>Tata</italic> was the 56th. But as <italic>Tata</italic> bid for Anglo-Dutch <italic>Corus</italic>, Brazilian <italic>Co Sidertrgica Nacional</italic> entered a bidding war retaining <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Lazard</italic>. Hiring ABN AMRO, <italic>Rothschild</italic>,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Tata </italic>won in India\u2019s largest ever deal and more than quadrupled its annual capacity to become the fifth-largest steel producer by 2007.\nIn America in 2005, Brahmins doctors Anu Gupta and Arnab Ghatak married after meeting through social media. While Anu was born to a gastroenterologist,<italic> </italic>educated at <italic>Brown</italic> and <italic>Yale</italic>, and directed philanthropy at <italic>Johnson & Johnson</italic>, Arnab was a <italic>McKinsey </italic>Principal specializing in pharmaceuticals with degrees from <italic>Princeton</italic> and <italic>Wharton</italic>, while his mother was a <italic>Medicaid </italic>director. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, <italic>McKinsey</italic> alum and Buffet\u2019s heir apparent, Ajit Jain engineered a large premium deal to cover losses for <italic>Lloyd </italic>Insurer. \nWith several hundred co-workers, Ajit\u2019s cousin Anshu followed Edson Mitchell from <italic>Merrill </italic>to <italic>Deutsche </italic>in 1995. Within a year, Mitchell died in a plane crash, and Buffett predicted that Anshu would soon lead <italic>Deutsche</italic>. After successfully betting on the fall of ABCP before the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, Anshu became CEO of <italic>Deutsche </italic>in 2012, the first non-European to hold that position. For around two years, without Anshu\u2019s knowledge or approval, his bankers conspired to fix various rates, laundered money to Russia, and turned <italic>Deutsche </italic>into <italic>Trump</italic>\u2019s largest creditor, helping him refinance of a skyscraper in Chicago, purchase a golf resort in Florida, and renovation of Washington\u2019s <italic>Old Post Office Building</italic>. \nBy 2009, <italic>BlackRock</italic> bought <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s ETF business, more than doubling assets to create the world\u2019s largest asset manager; often the largest single corporate stakeholder across debt and equity. While <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Bruce Wasserstein married Taiwanese heiress and Senator McConnell\u2019s sister-in-law Angela Chao in 2009, he died soon after. Wasserstein\u2019s successor Ken Jacobs invested in sovereign advisory and emerging markets. \nJacobs had joined <italic>Lazard</italic> New York in 1988 after four years at <italic>Goldman</italic>. His wife, Agn\u00e8s Mentr\u00e9, was a daughter of Paul Mentr\u00e9, who had been Deputy Director of French President Val\u00e9ry Estaing\u2019s office, CEO of <italic>Cr\u00e9dit National</italic>, and director at IMF and <italic>BANK</italic>. Mentr\u00e9\u2019s son, Gilles, became Managing Director at <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in 1999 after serving in various positions in the French government and foreign service.  \nAfter serving as CSFB\u2019s Executive Vice Chair and Chief Client Officer since 2004, Bayo Ogunlesi founded a global private equity firm to invest in infrastructure assets in the energy, transport, water, and waste industry sectors from 2006. After his firm grew to dozens of billions and bought London\u2019s <italic>Gatwick Airport</italic> from <italic>British Airports Authority</italic> in 2010, he became lead director of <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s board by 2012, soon becoming Risk Chair and replacing former <italic>Goldman </italic>Senior Director Stephen Friedman who reached the firm\u2019s mandatory retirement age of 75. \nSince Fellow West African, Tidjane Thiam fled to France during Ivory Coast\u2019s government coup in 1999, he became a <italic>McKinsey</italic> Partner in 2000. After two years, he left <italic>McKinsey</italic> for the newly formed <italic>Aviva</italic> insurer in Britain. By 2008, he became CFO of <italic>Prudential Insurance</italic> before a promotion made him the first Black executive to head one of the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>\u2019s hundred largest firms. \nPeter Orszag, mentored by Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers and previously overseeing <italic>Brookings Institute</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> <italic>Hamilton Project</italic>, concentrated on healthcare policy and climate change as Obama\u2019s OMB Director from 2007. By 2010, he married the daughter of the CIO for <italic>BHP Billiton</italic>\u2019s petroleum unit and helped enact healthcare reform. Already heavily regulated, rising unemployment in America continued to inflate education and health expenses. Rather than tax the medical lobby\u2014as the Court had allowed in 1995\u2014the <italic>Affordable Care Act of 2010</italic> (\u201cACA\u201d) taxed the employed. To align for-profit insurance with service, ACA shifted fee-for-service to value-based payment. For the young and healthy to subsidize the old and sick, ACA taxed the uninsured. While the Court upheld the tax in 2012, they allowed states to leave the program. By 2016, ACA reduced health discrepancies between industries. Since <italic>Dartmouth College</italic> became the first Ivy league to have an Asian president with the appointment of Korean-born global health expert Jim Kim in 2009, Obama nominated Kim as the first non-banker or politician to head <italic>BANK</italic> with a global health perspective in 2012.\nMeanwhile, Congress enacted the <italic> </italic>(\u201cFA2010\u201d). FA2010 expanded the scope of <italic>systemically important institutions</italic> to include payment systems, AIG, <italic>Prudential Insurance</italic>, <italic>MetLife Insurance</italic>, GE\u2019s airline leases, and MMMFs. So, SEC floated MMMF NAVs, allowing UST to monopolize MMMFs. For credit rating agencies, FA2010 required SEC to regulate rating methodologies and overturned civil liability exemptions. \nSince UST\u2019s <italic>Office of Thrift Services</italic> failed in regulating AIG, FA2010 transferred its powers to OCC. For \u2018too-big-to-fail\u2019 banks, FA2010 required living wills and provided FDIC liquidation powers (instead of reorgs.) Still, regulatory forbearance remained political. In 2016, FA2010 forced global banks with over $50 billion in assets to ring-fence American operations by establishing separate HCs for American operations, including local capital and liquidity standards and boards. By 2019, Europe followed with similar rules.\nWhen UST warned that asset managers could pose systemic risks in 2013, <italic>BlackRock</italic> successfully lobbied against being designated a <italic>systemically important institutions</italic> per FA2010. In 2010, <italic>BlackRock</italic> hired UST Advisor Kendrick Wilson\u2014who had banked at <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2014as Vice Chair. After <italic>BlackRock</italic> FMA hired Kevin Chavers\u2014the former President of <italic>Ginnie Mae</italic> during the Clinton Administration and a key advisor to the Congressional Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs\u2014in 2011, <italic>BlackRock</italic> added Cheryl Mills, a trusted confidante and advisor to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as a Board of Director in 2013. \nThe following year, <italic>BlackRock</italic> hired Salim Ramji, a <italic>McKinsey</italic> Senior Partner who led the firm\u2019s Asset & Wealth Management practice, as Global Head of Corporate Strategy. An Ismaili Shia Muslim born to Tanzanian Indians in Canada, he lawyered at <italic>Clifford Chance</italic> before joining <italic>McKinsey </italic>in 2002. <italic>BlackRock</italic> named Ramji Head of American Wealth Advisory in 2017. In 2015, <italic>BlackRock</italic> FMA hired UST Deputy Assistant and Senior Policy Advisor to Congressman Barney Frank\u2014Chair of the House Financial Services Committee and key architect of FA2010\u2014Kathryn Rosen as a Managing Director. Likewise, <italic>BlackRock</italic> hired Obama\u2019s UST General Counsel Chris Meade for the same role. \n<italic>BlackRock</italic> similarly captured public institutions globally. In 2012, Philipp Hildebrand, the former Chair of <italic>Swiss National Bank</italic>\u2019s Board joined <italic>BlackRock</italic> as a Senior Advisor after resigning due to a trading scandal. Next year, <italic>BlackRock</italic> added Mexico\u2019s Undersecretary of Finance & Public Credit Gerardo Rodriguez Regordosa as a Managing Director in the Emerging Markets Group. <italic>Bank of Canada</italic>\u2019s Deputy Governor Jean Boivin joined in 2014 and soon headed the Global Research division. \nAs Chancellor of <italic>Exchequer</italic> George Osborne\u2019s Chief of Staff Rupert Harrison joined as a Portfolio Manager, <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic> official Paschalis Bouchoris became a FMA Managing Director in 2015. Friedrich Merz, a former German politician and Deputy to Angela Merkel, was appointed Chair of <italic>BlackRock</italic> Germany in 2016. Within a year, George Osborne became a consultant in 2017 and <italic>Exchequer</italic> official Antony Manchester joined as a Managing Director. \nMore than the prudent investment, FA2010 regulated federal and financial industry lending and employment. Along with creating <italic>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</italic> (\u201cCFPB\u201d), FA2010 mandated that SEC, UST\u2019s OCC, FRS, FDIC, CFPB, and <italic>National Credit Union Administration</italic>\u2014establish <italic>Offices of Minority & Women Inclusion</italic> (\u201cOMWIs\u201d) to oversee diversity matters and develop standards for assessing diversity policies of entities regulated by them. \nAmong Obama\u2019s many <italic>Hamilton Project</italic> hires was Adewale \u2018Wally\u2019 Adeyemo. After immigrating from Nigeria, Adeyemo graduated <italic>Uni of California Berkeley</italic> and <italic>Yale</italic> Law. Adeyemo then led Black outreach for John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign before joining<italic> Hamilton Project</italic> as an editor. During the Obama administration, Adeyemo became the first Chief of Staff at CFPB in 2011 and later as Deputy National Security Advisor for International Economics and Deputy Director of <italic>National Economic Council</italic>.\nFA2010 regulated OTC markets Congress blamed for global commodity inflation in 2009 and post-<italic>Lehman</italic> runs. While diversified investors and municipal pensions replaced industry in swaps, opaque OTC derivatives attracted inflation blame. After CFTC asked global regulators to tighten oil swaps in June 2008, FA2010 mandated central clearing\u2014increasing oversight over trade and derivatives settling \u2018financial market utilities\u2019\u2014and repealed OTC derivative bankruptcy stay exemptions. FA2010 empowered SEC and CFTC to set swap capital and margin limits across foreign and OTC trades. Like EA2005 granted FERC enforcement powers against energy manipulation, FA2010 forced banks to spin-off FA1999\u2019s agricultural swap activities and directed CFTC to prevent Americans from global farm investment. \nAfter FRS paid interest on reserves during the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, banks transferred more payments on the FRS books, low reserves banks still waited to send after receiving. While SA1933 required SEC to regulate securities disclosures and behavior for tradeable bonds, it did not cover non-tradable bank loans and other private credit. By limiting bank risk via FA2010, FRS pushed KKR and other nonbanks\u2014with a disproportionate amount of <italic>Drexel Burnham</italic><italic> Lambert </italic>alumni\u2014to lend private credit. While this reduced FDIC liabilities by moving risk out of the banks, federal influence over growing LBO debt fell as well. \nA decade after buying <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s Great Planes gas pipes, <italic>Berkshire </italic>bought a major American railroad in 2010 as states blocked fossil fuel pipes to transport North Dakota\u2019s shale. While EA2005 created federal energy corridors\u2014to force states to allow inter-state energy transfers\u2014the Court vacated these in 2011. Without federal energy corridors, state protectionism stymied inter-state transmission of growing renewables. By 2012, <italic>Apollo</italic> LBO bought oil and gas giant <italic>El Paso Corp</italic>. \nMeanwhile, the <italic>Panic of 2007 </italic>fueled internet platforms over small businesses. Despite growing market power, these reduced consumer prices. From 2010, Congress sought to ease the costs that the <italic>Accounting Reform & Investor Protection Act of 2002</italic> (\u201cSA2002\u201d) placed on small firms. Despite lowering accounting standards and capital gains, the new legislation did little to reduce the costs of going public. Likewise, as IT remained legal for policy makers, including members of and FRS, damaging the integrity of governmental actors with corruption, Congress enacted the <italic>Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012</italic>. But it was frequently ignored and unenforceable.\nSince the 1990s, <italic>Amazon</italic> and other internet platforms have continued depriving municipalities of local sales taxes. Only in 2008 did New York start requiring them to collect taxes. However, since Congress subjected municipal bankruptcies to explicit state permission with BA1994, many states limited filings by withholding provisions. As a result, few municipalities discharged debt following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But with the Mexican Gulf\u2019s oil refining at risk, Congress released strategic petroleum reserves temporarily eased protectionist transport and blending regulations. \nAfter Congress stimulated private equity infrastructure investment in 2005, private toll road operators paid dividends with debt. As the operators lost debt access in the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, cities incentivized projects with fixed incomes guarantees. While municipal debtors with revenue pledges did not default, they reduced spending after losing bond insurance. As squeezed municipal pensions invested into LBOs, FA2010 furthered 1975 bond dealer regulation without increasing municipality reporting requirements. After Hurricane Sandy devastated New York in 2012, Governor Cuomo named Felix Rohatyn co-Chair of a commission tasked with enhancing the state\u2019s infrastructure resilience against natural disasters.\nAs with coal and oil, the common law \u2018right of capture\u2019 does not recognize ownership rights in an underground reservoir, allowing each water well owner an unlimited right of withdrawal. Without competition, integrated water PUs monopolies required large investment in purification, storage, and growth. As with PUs, Latin America liberalized water in the 1990s. However, cities with ample water benefited most and a fifth of the world\u2019s population did not have access to safe drinking water in 2000. While Congress encouraged farmers to sell their water to cities in 1992, many refused to give up the land values, particularly rivers like the Colorado, crossing eight states. While a private land trust in Oregon fostered water planning in 1995 and Australia federally planned water from 2007, competition continued in inter-state and -nation.\nAlthough FRS launched the <italic>Partnership for Progress</italic> to support and preserve minority-owned banks in 2008, Black banks deteriorated after the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic> led <italic>OneUnited</italic> and other Black banks for bailout funding. <italic>AME Church </italic>of Boston began missing loan payments by 2012. <italic>OneUnited</italic>, backed by the church building, decided to foreclose on the property, leading to criticism for its actions and perceived betrayal of its mission to serve urban communities. \nAlthough 21% of American churches were Black, they represented 75% of failed churches over this period. Around 650 Black churches filed for bankruptcy as creditors charged higher credit rates and rejected loan modifications. With fewer church resources, Black communities lost credit resources. Unlike Black and Native American peers, Asian and Hispanic banks benefited from strong foreign demand to invest in America. Among the largest MWO banks were <italic>Cathay Bank</italic> and BBCN of California, <italic>International Bank of Commerce</italic> (\u201cIBC\u201d) of Texas, <italic>Lumbee Guaranty Bank</italic> of North Carolina, being the largest among banks owned by Chinese, Korean, Hispanic, and Native Americans, respectively.\nBy this point, only one president nominated a Protestant to the Court since 1985. As Sandra Day O\u2019Connor retired in 2006 and Samuel Alito replaced her, Catholics formed a majority on the Court for the first time. This Catholic majority was then bolstered by the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor in 2009. By the time Elena Kagan joined the Court in 2010, there were no Protestant justices left. Republicans turned to a Mormon. Since 2003, <italic>Bain</italic>\u2019s Mitt Romney had been Governor of Massachusetts until 2007. He was the Republican nominee for the presidential election in 2012 and ran against the incumbent President, Obama. Although Mitt lost that race, Utah elected him to the Senate in 2018. \nBefore that, Black communities in the industrial state of Michigan, which Mitt\u2019s father governed in the 1960s, deteriorated. As calls for public water control grew, American municipalities stopped privatizing. Despite the increase of private equity assets, American cities and courts continued to limit the ability of private equity to trade water investments, which drove global private equity infrastructure.\nAfter UST bailed out automotive manufacturers using the bankruptcy process in 2009, Michigan applied a similar approach to Detroit before providing state aid in 2013. Within months, Detroit exited the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history through an $816 million deal involving major philanthropic foundations. Judge Gerald Rosen led efforts to secure funds from foundations, the State of Michigan, and <italic>Detroit Institute of Arts</italic> to protect city retirees\u2019 pensions and the art collection. The \u2018grand bargain\u2019 allowed Detroit to shed $7 B in debt and invest $1.7 B in services and repairs. Key contributors included <italic>Ford Foundation</italic>, which pledged $125 million, <italic>Knight Foundation</italic>, which contributed $30 million, and <italic>Kresge Foundation</italic>, which pledged $100 million. The State of Michigan provided $350 million over 20 years.\nWhile Michigan did not allow the surrounding municipalities to file for bankruptcy, the emergency oversight extended to them. One of these, Flint, was heavily indebted to Detroit for treated drinking water. So, Flint\u2019s emergency and local government leadership agreed with the municipal water utility to switch to cheaper sources, resulting in lead poisoning outbreaks in 2014. To manage budgets, some municipalities continued to subvert the criminal justice system, increasing civil fines and penalties against minorities. \nGas advances revived the automotive sector, stimulated American growth, and reduced trade deficits. Amidst revolutions across the energy-subsidy-reforming petrostates and Japan\u2019s nuclear catastrophe inflated oil\u2014and the gap with gas\u2014the White House released <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserves</italic>. Even though <italic>TXU</italic> generated power from coal, her regulators linked electricity rates to gas prices. As <italic>TXU</italic> defaulted in 2014, energy bankruptcies grew. By late 2015 and early 2016, coal producer<italic> Alpha Natural Resources</italic> (\u201cANR\u201d) and alternative energy company <italic>SunEdison</italic> filed for bankruptcy. While America bankruptcy law bars advisers from ownership interests, MIO<italic> Partners</italic>\u2014<italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s partner only investment fund\u2014owned ANR debt. Questioning <italic>McKinsey</italic> that MIO<italic> Partners </italic>was a blind trust, the court and DOJ probed whether <italic>McKinsey</italic> directed ANR assets to clients without disclosing this to the court for the reorg plan. <italic>McKinsey</italic> settled, waving fees and agreeing to disclose more in the future. \nAs the new elite, sponsored mentees inter-connected by hiring from one another and the federal government. After Sheryl Sandberg impressed her <italic>Harvard</italic> Professor Lawrence Summers, he hired as his research assistant at <italic>BANK</italic> and then UST. With stints at <italic>McKinsey</italic> while getting her MBA at <italic>Harvard</italic> and support from allies including Senator Hillary Clinton, Sandberg joined <italic>Google</italic> in 2001 and grew online advertising sales and operations from several people to a quarter of <italic>Google</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> total, accounting for more than half of the company\u2019s revenue. Alongside, she mentored Marissa Mayer. A Christian unrelated to Meyer, she graduated <italic>Stanford</italic>, and rejected <italic>McKinsey</italic> to become <italic>Google</italic>\u2019s 20th employee and its first female engineer in 1999. As the company grew, Mayer helped create <italic>Gmail</italic> and other products. \nA top executive by 2012, Mayer left to be CEO of <italic>Yahoo</italic>, joining a shortlist of female tech CEOs, including <italic>Bain</italic>-alum Meg Whitman (of <italic>eBay</italic> and <italic>Hewlett-Packard</italic> from 2011)<italic> </italic>and Virginia Rometty (of IBM). Another female executive was Safra Catz. After leaving <italic>Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette</italic> in 1997, she joined <italic>Oracle</italic>, becoming President and CFO by 2005. By 2008, she joined HSBC\u2019s Board until Larry Ellison stood down as CEO in 2014, naming Catz as <italic>Oracle</italic> co-CEO.\nAlthough not a firm CEO, <italic>Google</italic>\u2019s 16th employee was Silicon Valley-born Susan Wojcicki. While her father, a <italic>Stanford</italic> physics professor, was born to Polish Jewish refugees\u2014with his father being a founder of post-WWI Poland and his mother heading the Slavic division of the <italic>Library of Congress</italic>\u2014her mother came from a rabbinical family. After studying history and literature at <italic>Harvard</italic>, economics at <italic>UC Santa Cruz</italic>, and business at UCLA, Susan became <italic>Google</italic>\u2019s first marketing manager in 1999. \nShe helped embed free search boxes across the internet, create <italic>AdSense</italic>, and integrate ads into <italic>Gmail</italic>. Along with overseeing the advertising products that constituted most of <italic>Google</italic> and becoming one of 12 SVPs, she led the acquisition of <italic>YouTube</italic> and <italic>DoubleClick</italic>. Concurrently, her sister Anne married <italic>Google</italic> co-founder Sergey Brin in 2007 and founded <italic>23andMe</italic>. After Susan became CEO of <italic>YouTube</italic> in 2014, Anne\u2019s marriage to Brin ended in 2015. \nSeveral female investment banking executives also thrived since the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>. By 2008, <italic>Goldman</italic> hired Coptic Egyptian Dina Habib from the State Department. Habib led <italic>Goldman Foundation</italic>, overseeing the <italic>10,000 Women</italic> initiative, which launched in 2008 with a $100 million commitment to assist female-led businesses in developing countries. She also led the <italic>10,000 Small Businesses</italic> initiative, launched in response to public criticism amidst the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, with a $500 million pledge to support small American and British businesses.\nWith a finance degree from <italic>Uni of Illinois</italic>, Stephanie Cohen joined <italic>Goldman</italic> as an M&A analyst in 1999. After transitioning to Managing Director for <italic>Conflicts & Business Selection</italic> for the <italic>Investment Banking </italic>division in the Americas in 2008, she returned to M&A the following year. In 2011, she became <italic>Global Head of General Industries</italic> and <italic>Global Co-Head of Industrials M&A</italic>, with deals including <italic>Chrysler</italic>\u2019s repayment to UST. Becoming Partner in 2014, Stephanie led the global <italic>Financial Sponsor M&A</italic> group from 2015. Since Lara Warner transitioned from AT&T\u2019s Director of Investor Relations to <italic>Lehman</italic> in 1999 and joined CSFB in 2002 as a telecom equity analyst, she rose to <italic>Global Head of Fixed Income & Economic Research</italic>, <italic>Head of US Equity Research</italic>, and served as CFO and COO of the Investment Banking Division by 2015. As Head of M&A, <italic>Morgan </italic>promoted Anu Aiyengar.\nAnd in Europe, Dorothee Blessing\u2014whose husband led <italic>Commerzbank Dresdner</italic>\u2014became resigned as head of German-speaking investment banking of <italic>Goldman</italic> in 2013 to take on the same role at <italic>Morgan </italic>and become Vice Chair of international investment banking. Alison Rose thrived at Britain\u2019s largest bank, RBS. Born in a British military family, Rose studied law at <italic>Uni of Nottingham</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business before joining <italic>NatWest</italic> in 1992. After RBS acquired <italic>NatWest</italic>, she served as Managing Director of Leveraged Finance (2000-2006), Global Head of Non-Investment Grade Origination (2006-2009), and Global Head of Financial Sponsors (2012-2014). As Deputy CEO of <italic>NatWest</italic> from 2014, she oversaw commercial and private banking. (Rose\u2019s husband, David Slade, headed Global Leveraged Finance for UBS.)\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s most successful female investor, Zhang Meilan, came from a long line of Chinese merchants in Saigon. Saigon, formerly the capital of French Indochina and later South Vietnam, was renamed Ho Chi Minh City after its capture by North Vietnam. Meilan\u2019s uncle, Zhang Fengyu, was born in Guangdong, China, but spent his early years in Saigon. His great-grandfather founded <italic>He Shun Fa Shipping Co</italic> in Saigon during the colonial period, providing logistics and unloading services between Saigon and the Mekong Delta, one of the world\u2019s largest rice markets at the time. Fengyu moved to Hong Kong in 1964, started his own business, and emigrated to Australia in 1982. He returned to Vietnam in 1993 to assist Meilan with her expanding business.\nMeilan, born in Ho Chi Minh City, began her career as a market stall vendor selling cosmetics with her mother in the 1980s. After Vietnam\u2019s 1986 Doi Moi reforms allowed private enterprise, Meilan shifted to real estate. In 1992, she founded <italic>Van Thinh Phat</italic>, which became a major player in high-end real estate, owning hotels, office buildings, and shopping centers. By 2011, Meilan facilitated the merger of three banks\u2014<italic>Ficombank</italic>, <italic>TinNghiaBank</italic>, and <italic>Saigon Commercial Bank</italic> (\u201cSCB\u201d)\u2014into SCB, becoming Vietnam\u2019s largest. Despite legal limits on individual share ownership, Meilan used shell companies, including her husband in Hong Kong, her granddaughter\u2019s <italic>Windsor Property Management</italic>, and others, to control over 90% of SCB.\nDuring this time, women chaired central banks in countries including Honduras, Malaysia, Pakistan, Thailand, Paraguay, Kenya, South Africa, and Bahamas. In 2011, Christine Largarde became the first female head of IMF. Around this time, Dutch-national Neelie Kroes, EC Competition Commissioner, often repeated the sexist and false claim that \u201c<italic>Lehman Sisters would not have failed</italic>\u201d, advocating for more women on boards and banks to reduce risk (After her term, Kroes became a Special Advisor for <italic>Bank of America</italic> by 2015). \nHeiresses also wielded considerable power from <italic>Wal-Mart</italic> to mining. Although aristocratic heiress Gina Hancock Rinehart inherited her father\u2019s <italic>Hancock Prospecting</italic> of Australia, which expanded from iron to coal and other enterprises, becoming  one of the wealthiest women in the world. Women also reached new heights in private equity. \nAfter Sandra Horbach became first female partner at <italic>Forstmann Little</italic> in 1992, she joined <italic>Carlyle</italic> in 2005, and became co-head of America buyout arm by 2016. While Adena Friedman had been CFO for 3 years, she returned to NASDAQ in 2014 as President. Generally, 46% of <italic>Carlyle</italic>\u2019s permanent hires over that period were women or minorities, with 67% of post-business-school associate hires for corporate private equity being women by 2016. Across private equity, women made up 13% of top executives, and 15% among the biggest buyout firms. \nAt <italic>Blackstone</italic>, management committee member Joan Solotar led multi-asset investing and external relations. Likewise, <italic>Blackstone</italic> hired <italic>Yale</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>-alum Wesley LePatner\u2014whose father was a real estate restructuring lawyer and had chaired <italic>Paul Hasting</italic>\u2019s insolvency group\u2014who soon led <italic>Blackstone</italic>\u2019s REIT. With a degree in Economics from <italic>McGill</italic> and three years of experience at <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>, Franziska Kayser became KKR\u2019s youngest director in 2017, and was promoted to MD three years later, becoming KKR\u2019s most senior woman in Europe. And as <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> Director Bruno Schr\u00f6der died in 2019, his daughter, Leonie, took over his position, without ever working in financial services.\nLikewise, Black women reached new heights in finance. Since Carla Harris became Chair of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> Foundation in 2005, President Obama appointed her Chair of <italic>National Women</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Business Council</italic> in 2013. The same year, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> promoted her to Vice Chair of <italic>Wealth Management</italic>. Asahi Pompey began her career at <italic>Goldman</italic> in 2006 and achieved the position of Managing Director in 2010 as Chief Compliance Officer for Investment Banking before becoming Partner in 2018. Raised in Guyana, Asahi immigrated to Brooklyn as a child, benefiting from scholarships through <italic>Swarthmore College</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic> Law. She previously worked as an attorney at <italic>Cleary Gottlieb</italic>, with roles in New York and Frankfurt, followed American Counsel for <italic>Pfizer</italic>. \nAfter studying economics from <italic>Uni of Ibadan</italic> in 1992 and earning an MBA from <italic>Northwestern Uni </italic>by 1998, Nigerian-born Titi Cole became a <italic>McKinsey</italic> manager over the following 6 years. Leaving for finance, Cole held senior positions at <italic>BMO Harris Bank</italic> and became SVP and Head of Payments at <italic>Bank of America</italic> from 2010. By 2014, Cole took over Retail Products until leaving for <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> to be EVP and Head of Shared Services, Consumer Credit Solutions in 2014 until becoming Head of Operations after two years.\nAs Mark Zuckerberg grew <italic>Facebook</italic> in 2008, he hired former <italic>Bell</italic> Canada\u2019s President of Operations (and <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s head of North American Telecom Practice before that) Patrick Pichette to be CFO. For COO, he poached fellow <italic>McKinsey</italic>-alum and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lawrence Summers and government-insider, Sheryl Sandberg, from <italic>Google</italic>. Similarly, to thwart antitrust from the Obama Administration, <italic>Facebook</italic> hired Louisa Terrell as Public Policy Director from 2011 to 2013. A childhood friend of VP Biden\u2019s son, Terrell graduated <italic>Boston College</italic> Law and spent most of her career with Senator Biden.\nBy 2015, <italic>Facebook</italic> had surged ahead of <italic>eBay</italic> and <italic>Amazon</italic>, trailing only <italic>Google</italic>, <italic>Microsoft</italic>, and <italic>Apple</italic> in rankings. Amid competition from <italic>Twitter</italic> and <italic>Facebook</italic> for talent, Larry Page sought to retain <italic>McKinsey</italic>-alum Pichai and other valuable resources through financial incentives and career development opportunities. So, he increased Sundar Pichai\u2019s responsibilities until appointing him CEO of <italic>Google</italic> in 2015, while Page managed a new parent HC, <italic>Alphabet</italic>, that included other ventures. To lead his <italic>Schmidt Foundation</italic>, <italic>Google</italic>\u2019s Eric Schmidt chose Eric Braverman, a onetime <italic>McKinsey</italic> consultant who worked with Chelsea, who referred him to be Head of <italic>Clinton Foundation</italic>. For Chief Innovation Officer, Schmidt hired Thomas Kalil, who served under presidents Clinton and Obama on science, technology and innovation initiatives. \nLike Sundar Pichai,<italic> Microsoft</italic> promoted an Indian Brahmin technology veteran Satya Nadella from within the company to CEO in 2014. Nadella became the company\u2019s 3rd CEO, replacing Steven Ballmer. High caste Indians also thrived in other ends of the technology and financial spheres. While <italic>SanDisk</italic> promoted co-founder Sanjay Mehrotra to CEO in 2011,<italic> Deloitte</italic> named Punit Renjan Chair by 2016. As <italic>Adani</italic> and <italic>Reliance</italic> <italic>bania</italic> mercantile caste conglomerates dominated in India, only one top ten e-commerce site in India was founded locally without <italic>bania</italic> involvement. Like Rakesh Khurana at <italic>Harvard</italic>, other <italic>bania</italic> were deans of top business schools, including Nohria at <italic>Harvard Business</italic>, Anjani Jain at <italic>Wharton</italic> and <italic>Yale</italic>, and Dipak Jain at INSEAD. \nFrom 2015, PM Narendra Modi favored <italic>Adani</italic> in his diplomatic engagements. In June 2015, Modi met the PM of Bangladesh, which preceded <italic>Adani</italic> signing a deal to supply electricity there in August. In March 2017, Modi met Malaysia\u2019s PM, and shortly after, <italic>Adani</italic> secured a container port project. Modi\u2019s January 2018 meeting with Israeli PM Netanyahu coincided with <italic>Adani</italic>\u2019s December deal to build drones in Israel. Following Modi\u2019s June 2018 meeting with Singapore\u2019s PM, a Singaporean firm invested 1,000 crores in <italic>Adani</italic> ports that July. In February 2020, Modi met Sri Lanka\u2019s PM, and Adani was involved in a port project by July. \nWhile <italic>ArcelorMittal</italic> and <italic>Tata </italic>struggled with European steel, another Hindu steel baron came to their rescue.  Born in 1971 in Ludhiana, India, Sanjeev Gupta\u2019s grandfather owned steel mills, and his father built a bicycle manufacturing business in Britain. While Gupta focused on commodities trading from 1993, he expanded into steel and metals, acquiring assets globally over the next two decades. From invested in steel plants in South Wales in 2013, Gupta gained wider attention by buying <italic>Tata</italic>\u2019s British steel assets in 2016, followed by <italic>ArcelorMittal</italic>\u2019s plants in Romania, Czechia, and several other European countries in 2019. By 2022, Indians\u2014ranging from multigenerational residents to international investors\u2014were the largest property owners in London, followed by White Britons and Pakistanis.\nAlong with corporations, Indian technology powered global real estate. After earning an engineering masters from SUNY <italic>Stony Brook</italic> and an MBA from <italic>Eastern Michigan Uni</italic>, Mohan Asnani co-founded <italic>CompuWave</italic> and BMAK <italic>Computer Systems</italic> for engineering and construction-related services by the 1980s and then expanded to buying, developing, and selling real estate in California. While Asnani\u2019s son started at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, the pair founded Mumbai-based knowledge process outsourcing company <italic>Prothious Engineering Services</italic> by 2002 and soon served clients across six continents contributed. Along with projects such as rebuilding <italic>World Trade Center</italic> in New York City in the 2010s, the Asnani family launched REITs and other ventures.\nPromotion of the new elite was strong in government-owned <italic>Citi</italic>. On <italic>Citi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s board since 1996 and advisor to Obama in 2008, Richard Parsons became <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s first Black Chair in 2009. At the same time, he became Senior Advisor to <italic>Providence Equity Partners</italic>, a media and entertainment focused LBO, while remaining on the boards of <italic>Est\u00e9e Lauder</italic> and <italic>Madison Square Garden.</italic><italic> </italic>The same year, his co-racial, Raymond McGuire rose from co-Head of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s investment banking to Head of global banking. \nFathered by a Black man who died when he was young, Robert Reffkin was raised by his Israeli immigrant mother cast out by her Jewish family. Graduating from <italic>Columbia</italic> Uni in just over two years, Reffkin joined <italic>McKinsey</italic> as the youngest Analyst and then <italic>Lazard</italic>, where he founded the firm\u2019s minority professional internship program. Later, he became a VP at <italic>Goldman</italic>, where he served as Chief of Staff to Gary Cohn. Along with founding mentorship to first-generation college students, Reffkin co-founded tech-driven real estate <italic>Compass</italic> in 2012, among the <italic>Fortune 500</italic>\u2019s first Black founders.\nPeter Orszag, mentored by Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers and previously overseeing <italic>Brookings Institute</italic>\u2019s <italic>Hamilton Project</italic>, concentrated on healthcare policy and climate change as Obama\u2019s OMB Director from 2007, helping enact the <italic>Affordable Care Act of 2010</italic> (\u201cACA\u201d). In 2010, he married the daughter of the CIO for <italic>BHP Billiton</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> petroleum unit. By 2012, the partially nationalized <italic>Citi</italic> made Orszag Vice Chair, his first job outside of think-tanks and government. \nHealthcare reform also spurred healthcare transactions. As <italic>Valeant</italic> profits fell, they hired <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Michael Pearson as CEO in 2008. Before leaving, Pearson headed Global Pharmaceuticals and was a Board Director after over two decades with <italic>McKinsey</italic>. Pearson soon hired the <italic>Princeton</italic>, <italic>Stanford</italic>, and <italic>Wharton</italic> educated Rajiv de Silva, who had helped lead <italic>McKinsey</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s pharmaceutical practice before becoming a senior executive at <italic>Novartis</italic>, as COO. Pearson also hired <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Ryan Weldon, son of <italic>Johnson Johnson</italic>\u2019s Chair Bill Weldon, as a senior executive. \nSince 2004, <italic>McKinsey</italic> engaged in at least 75 projects with <italic>Purdue Pharma</italic>, focusing on sales strategies and regulatory advice. In 2007, <italic>McKinsey</italic> renewed its contract with <italic>Purdue</italic>, with Navjot Singh advising on the company\u2019s R&D and creating pitch materials. After <italic>Purdue</italic>\u2019s 2008 guilty plea for misbranding <italic>OxyContin</italic>, <italic>McKinsey</italic> intensified its consulting work for the company. By 2010, Singh was involved in regulatory meetings for <italic>Purdue</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s <italic>BuTrans</italic> opioid patch. In 2013, Arnab Ghatak co-led <italic>Purdue</italic>\u2019s \u201c<italic>Evolve to Excellence</italic>\u201d project to enhance sales. Consultants accompanied sales staff for feedback. Singh, Jeff Smith, and Sastry Chilukuri worked on both <italic>Food & Drug Administration</italic> (\u201cFDA\u201d) and <italic>Purdue</italic> projects simultaneously at one point. Active with FDA from 2007, Smith worked on <italic>Purdue</italic>\u2019s regulatory efforts for <italic>BuTrans</italic> and pediatric <italic>OxyContin</italic>. \nBy 2009, <italic>McKinsey</italic> claimed to serve most of the international legal narcotics trade, advising <italic>Purdue</italic>, <italic>Johnson & Johnson</italic>, and others on maximizing their franchise value. As <italic>Valeant</italic> pivoted from R&D to buying competitors and raising prices, Rajiv Silva left in 2013 to become <italic>Endo</italic>\u2019s CEO. Enlisting <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Justin Smith on marketing strategies for opioid <italic>Opana</italic> in 2013 and another expert for a tax inversion in 2014, <italic>Endo</italic> became a significant American manufacturer of generic opioids. The same year, former <italic>McKinsey</italic> partner Frank Scholz became a senior executive at <italic>Mallinckrodt</italic>, the largest manufacturer of generic opioids. \nAs <italic>Valeant</italic> completed over a hundred acquisitions, some drug prices grew 4,000%. Amidst the price gouging scandal, stock prices collapsed. As Pearson resigned in 2016, <italic>Valeant</italic> soon changed strategy and sold itself. By then, addition concerns about opioid painkiller in rural areas grew. At first reducing promotion, <italic>Endo</italic> soon hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> to increase resources for the drug. Advising the FDA\u2019s drug-regulation division on drug approvals and pharmaceutical industry monitoring since 2008, <italic>McKinsey</italic> launched a center focused on opioids data insights for clients including state governments, insurers, and health systems from 2017. Remaining secretive, <italic>McKinsey</italic> did not reveal the conflicts of interest to the latter of advising the former. \nMore than just opioids, <italic>McKinsey</italic> had a long history of advising the over-the-counter narcotics industry. In 1956, <italic>McKinsey</italic> began advising <italic>Philip Morris</italic> on operational improvements, supporting research efforts that enabled engineered nicotine levels in cigarettes. Despite the 1964 Surgeon General\u2019s report linking smoking to cancer, <italic>McKinsey</italic> continued working with tobacco firms, including <italic>RJ Reynolds</italic>, <italic>Lorillard</italic>, and <italic>British American Tobacco</italic>. In the 1990s, <italic>McKinsey</italic> advised <italic>Lorillard</italic> on marketing strategies for her high-nicotine<italic> Newport</italic> brand. \nFrom 2009, while advising tobacco clients, <italic>McKinsey</italic> worked on contracts for FDA\u2019s <italic>Center for Tobacco Products</italic>, which was established to oversee tobacco regulation under the <italic>Family Smoking Prevention & Tobacco Control Act</italic>. <italic>McKinsey</italic> provided FDA with guidance on \u201crisk identification and mitigation\u201d related to tobacco and helped shape the agency\u2019s regulatory framework and policies aimed at reducing tobacco-related harm. While<italic> </italic>advising <italic>Altria</italic>, formerly<italic> Philip Morris</italic>, on marketing premium e-cigarettes, <italic>McKinsey</italic> contracted with <italic>Juul </italic>in 2017, advising branding and surveying teenagers to gauge flavor preferences, finding \u201cmint\u201d as a top choice. <italic>McKinsey </italic>also prepared <italic>Juul</italic>\u2019s responses as FDA investigated surging youth vaping rates.\nEven as the prices of durables continued to fall since 2000, those of services soared. Like in healthcare, a large part of education cost increases came in the form of administrative bloat. In American healthcare between 1975 and 2010, the number of administrators increased by 3,200%, far surpassing the growth of physicians, which only increased by 150% over the period. \nSimilarly, in higher education, the number of full-time administrators and other professionals employed by those institutions increased by 164 and 452% from 1976 to 2018, outpacing the growth in faculty and students, which increased by 92 and 78%, respectively. While MIT soon had nearly nine times more non-faculty employees than faculty, <italic>Yale</italic> had administrator for every undergraduate student. Much of this was due to a greater diversity of students.\nBefore <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s first Black director, Byron Auguste, argued that academia had a monopoly on \u2018good jobs\u2019, affirmative action gave way to <italic>Diversity, Equity & Inclusion</italic> (\u201cDEI\u201d). While continuing subsidize \u2018diverse\u2019 students with financial grant and lower admission requirements regardless of social class or caste, Ivy league and local universities hired faculty based on similar standards, pivoting from equality of opportunity to that of outcome. \nAlong with decreasing selection standards, they hid or gave everyone similar grades to prevent employers from distinguishing employers from meritocratic hiring. <italic>Uni of Michigan</italic> soon spent over $250 million on DEI, with few results to show. Likewise, corporations continued to settle lawsuits outside of court. Since acquiring <italic>Merrill</italic>, <italic>Bank of America</italic> settled her <italic>Stowell Friedman</italic>\u2019s class-action racial discrimination case from 2005, agreeing to pay $160 million in 2013 on top of $250 million paid to women since 1998.\nSince leading <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s international pharmaceutical<italic> </italic>practice, Vivian Hunt, an American-born Black woman educated at <italic>Harvard </italic>and <italic>Harvard </italic>Business, rose to<italic> McKinsey</italic> London\u2019s Senior Managing Partner. From 2015, onwards, she co-authored most of <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s studies on the value of racial and ethnic diversity to corporate profits. Although independent researchers could not replicate these results, Queen Elizabeth named Hunt a Dame of the British Empire in 2017, and so supported Hunt\u2019s claim to lead <italic>McKinsey</italic>.\nAfter <italic>McKinsey</italic> partner Stephan Sands joined <italic>Lazard</italic> in 1994, he rose to Vice Chair of Investment Banking in 2014 and Chair of Healthcare in 2016. That year, <italic>Lazard</italic> poached Orszag from <italic>Citi</italic> as Head of North American M&A and, soon after, co-Head of Global Healthcare. After 16 years of <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s board\u2014with three as Chair\u2014Richard Parsons resigned in 2012 and joined <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s board, alongside co-racial Vernon Jordan. While <italic>Lazard</italic> hired government insiders, <italic>McKinsey</italic> continued supplying them.\nIn Germany, Bensberg-born Oliver B\u00e4te received his training at <italic>Westdeutsche Landesbank</italic> in Cologne. He earned an MBA from <italic>New York Uni</italic> and joined <italic>McKinsey</italic> in New York in 1993, before moving to <italic>McKinsey</italic> Germany where he later led the insurance and asset management practice. In 2008, he became COO at <italic>Allianz</italic>, and by 2015, he became board Chair. Likewise, since leaving <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 2000, Stephan Leithner joined <italic>Deutsche</italic><italic> </italic>Bank\u2019s board before leaving for a private equity shop in 2015. By 2018, he joined \u00a0<italic>Deutsche B\u00f6rse</italic>\u2014which <italic>McKinsey</italic> alum Werner Seifert turned into Europe\u2019s largest exchange a decade earlier\u2014and became Chair by 2024.\nTom Barkin held significant roles during as <italic>McKinsey </italic>partner, overseeing their offices in the America South and serving as <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s CFO and Chief Risk Officer. Concurrently, he was a Director of FRS <italic>Atlanta</italic>, becoming Chair for the last two years of his term from 2009 to 2014. In late 2017, Barkin left <italic>McKinsey</italic> to take on a leadership position at FRS <italic>Richmond</italic>. \nBy then, <italic>Goldman</italic> had strong ties with ECB and BOE as well as with quarter of regional FRS presidents after three new appointments. While William Dudley led FRS <italic>New York</italic>, <italic>Goldman</italic> trustee Patrick Harker joined in Philadelphia as <italic>Goldman</italic> Vice Chair Robert Kaplan joined in FRS <italic>Dallas</italic>. Neel Kashkari, who worked at <italic>Goldman</italic> for four years before overseeing the government\u2019s bailout of the banking industry, was appointed head of FRS <italic>Minneapolis</italic> in early 2016. Although Kashkari became the first Hindu and only non-academic, he was the only non-White.\nMeanwhile, like Jews that left their religion or practiced in secret, even elite LGBT did not feel comfortable about fully acknowledging themselves publicly. Compared to other corporations, Wall Street provided more LGBT-friendly benefits but remained a homophobic boys\u2019 club. \nScott Bessent was among the few senior \u2018out\u2019 financiers. From a small-town South Carolina, where his family had been gentry for three centuries, he considered attending the <italic>Naval Academy</italic> but chose to attend <italic>Yale</italic> instead because he did not want to lie about his sexuality. After working for James Rogers, George Soros\u2019 first partner, Bessent joined <italic>Soros</italic> in 1991 and played a key role in the firm\u2019s bet against the British <italic>pound</italic> the following year. After overseeing European investments, he served as chief investment officer from 2011 to 2015, making a successful bet against the Japanese <italic>yen</italic> in 2013 before leaving to found a hedge fund with capital from <italic>Soros</italic>.\nAfter earning a computer science MS from <italic>Harvard </italic>and PhD in medical information from <italic>Stanford</italic>, New Mexico-born Martin Chavez was Global Head of Energy Derivatives at CSFB from 1997 until <italic>Enron</italic> collapsed. The technologist then automated <italic>Goldman </italic>as Global Co-Head of Securities, CIO, and CFO. He also served as a <italic>Harvard</italic> Overseer. While tracing his Sephardi ancestry to gain Spanish citizenship and praising his single mother of Basque and Aztec descent, he identified as Hispanic and gay. (Likewise, Martin\u2019s siblings graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Stanford</italic>, became entrepreneurs, and identified mostly with their Hispanic heritage.) \nMixed identities also helped Kamala Harris, the daughter of an Indian Brahmin mother and Jamaican-born Marxist taught economics at <italic>Stanford</italic>. Serving as the District Attorney of San Francisco from 2004, she succeeded Jerry Brown as Attorney General in 2011 and Barbara Boxer as Senator from California from 2017.\nAlong with gays themselves, straight executives\u2019 views shifted from personal connections. After their children came out as gay, John Mack, former CEOs of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> and CSFB, Paul Singer, CEO of hedge fund <italic>Elliott Management</italic>, and Dan O\u2019Connell, CEO of private equity <italic>Vestar Capital Partners</italic>, experienced significant transformations in their perspectives on LGBTQ issues. Initially holding anti-gay or indifferent views, Mack, Singer, and O\u2019Connell became vocal advocates for LGBTQ rights, aligning with more inclusive policies. Mack\u2019s son came out in 1997, Singer\u2019s in 1998, and O\u2019Connell\u2019s in 2011. These personal experiences led them to support equality initiatives. Singer notably pushed the Republican Party to back gay rights, launching <italic>American Unity PAC</italic> in 2012. By 2015, gay marriage became legal nationally. \nAmidst the energy crisis\u2014and national debate\u2014Obama named Janet Yellen the first female FRS Chair in 2014. (Within months, Nigeria, Cyprus, Maldives, and Ukraine followed in naming female central banking chairs.) For his Counselor, Obama hired former Clinton administration White House Chief of Staff and Soros-funded <italic>Center for American Progress</italic> co-founder John Podesta, who soon emphasized executive powers for policy implementation over the legislative process. By 2015, Obama hired Archana Sahgal, who managed grants at <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic> for immigration reform for five years. After overseeing numerous committees as Director of Department of Commerce, Sahgal became Senior Associate Director in the White House\u2019s <italic>Office of Public Engagement</italic>, focusing on liaising with identity-based \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201clabor\u201d communities.\nFor foreign policy and defense, the Obama Administration hired from and fed a revolving door of service and consultants. While President Clinton\u2019s Secretary of State Madeline Albright co-founded<italic> Albright Stonebridge</italic>, which consulted <italic>Merck</italic>, <italic>Pfizer</italic>, <italic>Amazon</italic>, <italic>Lyft</italic>, <italic>Microsoft</italic>, <italic>Gates Foundation</italic>, and <italic>Hilton</italic> from 2001, long-time aide to President Clinton Douglas Band and Hillary Clinton\u2019s fundraiser Declan Kelly co-founded advisory firm <italic>Teneo</italic> in 2011. \nThe firm\u2019s roster included prominent figures like former President Bill Clinton, who joined <italic>Teneo</italic>\u2019s advisory board early on, and Huma Abedin, who worked for <italic>Teneo</italic> while serving as a deputy chief of staff to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and working at <italic>Clinton Foundation</italic>. With clients including IBM, <italic>Xerox</italic>, UBS, and <italic>Alcoa</italic>, <italic>Teneo</italic> facilitated over two dozen visits to the White House for client <italic>Dow Chemical</italic> since 2009. In late 2016, leaked emails revealed Chelsea Clinton\u2019s accusations against <italic>Teneo</italic> employees for leveraging her father\u2019s name to secure meetings with lawmakers, igniting concerns about conflicts of interest.\nBy 2017, Obama\u2019s Deputy National Security Advisor Antony Blinken\u2014whose father, <italic>Warburg</italic> <italic>Pincus</italic> co-founder Donald Blinken, had served as Ambassador to Hungary in the Clinton Administration and worked closely with George Soros\u2014and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Mich\u00e8le Flournoy founded <italic>WestExec Advisors</italic> to focus on defense policy and national security. <italic>WestExec</italic> provided advisory services to <italic>Pine Island Capital Partners</italic>, which was co-founded in 2018 by former CEO of <italic>Merrill </italic>John Thain to invest in the aerospace and defense sectors. <italic>Pine Island </italic>subsequently added partners, including retired Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, former Pentagon official Robert Work, and retired Army General Lloyd Austin, who served on <italic>Raytheon</italic>\u2019s board after retiring.\nMinority women similarly prospered at DOJ and FTC. In 2014, the Obama Administration appointed Vanita Gupta as <italic>Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division</italic>. Known for her dedication to equal justice, Gupta advocated for civil rights, previously working at <italic>American Civil Liberties Union</italic> and <italic>NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund</italic>, focusing on promoting policing and criminal justice reforms. She was married to Chinh Le, the legal director of the <italic>Legal Aid Society</italic> of the District of Columbia. After appointing Vanita Gupta<italic> Acting Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division</italic> in 2014, President Obama promoted her <italic>Associate Attorney General</italic> in 2017, the third-ranking official at DOJ, supervising the <italic>Civil</italic>, <italic>Civil Rights</italic>, <italic>Antitrust</italic>, <italic>Tax</italic>, and <italic>Environmental & Natural Resources</italic> divisions. \nAlso in 2017, Lina Khan, who was born in London to Pakistani parents and immigrated to America, published an article while at <italic>Yale </italic>Law. Challenging antitrust\u2019s focus on consumer prices, Khan contended that <italic>Amazon</italic>\u2019s integration across various business lines and its role as essential infrastructure for the internet economy threatened competition. As she gained prominence, FTC hired her as a temporary adviser. Without telecom experience, Biden family friend and <italic>Facebook</italic> lobbyist Louisa Terrell became Counsel to the Chair of FCC.\nWith the growth of the federal government since the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, the Republican Party splintered. Back in 2000, Eric Cantor, a lawyer from a Richmond real estate family, was elected to Congress as the only Jewish Republican. By 2011, he became House Majority Leader, the first Jew to lead a chamber of Congress. He forged close ties to Wall Street, opposing taxes on private equity and hedge fund regulations. Facing growing dissatisfaction from his district\u2019s Tea Party faction, Cantor lost the Republican primary in June 2014 to David Brat, a Christian ethics professor from a small college. After his defeat, Cantor resigned in August and joined <italic>Moelis</italic> as Vice Chair.\nWhile John Podesta resigned as Obama\u2019s Counselor in 2015 to Chair Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, conservative votes had revolted against political insiders and rallied behind the outsider Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. As <italic>Deutsche</italic> was <italic>Trump</italic>\u2019s largest creditor and Russia\u2019s business partner, scrutiny of Trump and Russian money laundering led Anshu Jain to resign from <italic>Deutsche</italic> in 2015 and join <italic>Cantor Fitzgerald</italic>. His cousin Ajait launched <italic>Berkshire</italic> in India, but his age reduced his chance at succeeding Buffet. \nAlong with gender, the election quickly focused on identity. Although Trump campaigned for Black conservatives\u2014including Herschel Walker in Georgia\u2014Trump supported Southern Republican legislatures in curtailing local authority over the removal of Confederate monuments\u2014mostly funded by <italic>United Daughters of the Confederacy</italic> before WWI\u2014following the earlier anti-Black mass shooting at a Charleston church. \nDespite winning the Democratic primary against competition from the left wing of her party, Hillary Clinton lost to Trump. While the Obama Administration banned federal coal leases after the election, Trump soon overturned these. For his UST secretary, Trump appointed fellow heir Steven Mnuchin, who followed his father into <italic>Goldman</italic> and served as CIO on Management Committee until before briefly managing <italic>Soros</italic>\u2019 <italic>SFM Capital</italic> in 2004. He later co-founded <italic>Dune Capital</italic> with fellow <italic>Goldman</italic> alumni, with <italic>Soros</italic> as an early investor. \nTo direct <italic>National Economic Council</italic>, Trump named <italic>Goldman</italic> COO and President Gary Cohn, leading <italic>Goldman</italic> to replace Cohn with David Solomon. To chair FRS, Trump promoted Obama\u2019s FRS governor, Jerome Powell. Descended from Scottish aristocracy and with a DC legal lineage, Powell worked at <italic>Dillon </italic>from 1984 until joining fellow Catholic <italic>Dillon</italic> alum Nicholas Brady at UST in 1990 as Assistant Secretary for Domestic Finance. In 1992, President Bush nominated him as Under Secretary of UST. He worked on a banking bill and led a report on government securities auctions. In 1993, he joined <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> and returned to <italic>Dillon</italic> in 1995. \nAlthough 82% of his Cabinet were White men, several of Trump\u2019s appointees were family of powerful politicians. To push his ambitious infrastructure agenda, he named Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s wife Taiwanese-born Elaine Chao. While the first and highest Asian American woman in the federal government, her sister and <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Bruce Wasserstein\u2019s widow, Angela, was Head of China iron shipping <italic>Foremost</italic> and ascended to <italic>Bank of China</italic>\u2019s board in in 2017. \nWhile appointing Mitt Romney\u2019s niece to Chair the <italic>Republican National Committee</italic>, Trump named Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee\u2019s daughter as White House Press Secretary. <italic>Goldman</italic> Managing Director and Coptic Egyptian Dina Habib became Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy, advising on foreign policy, with an emphasis on the Middle East. Bypassing anti-nepotism law, Trump mirrored his family business as he appointed his children and in-laws as senior White House advisory \u2018consultants\u2019 and appointed his son-in-law to lead DOE\u2019s climate policy.\nAmidst numerous potential conflicts of interest and possible violations of the Emoluments Clause during his presidency, Trump\u2019s golf and hotel properties garnered $7.8 million from 20 foreign governments, notably $5.5 million from China and $615,000 from Saudi Arabia. Notably, the Chinese payments included a pre-existing 2008 lease with <italic>Industrial & Commercial Bank of China</italic>. Additionally, Trump secured 67 trademarks from foreign governments during his presidency, with 46 originating from China. While Trump\u2019s businesses faced accusations of offering overpriced goods or services, they were distinguished from Hunter Biden and others who allegedly facilitated access to influential politicians. Although Rudy Giuliani was initially favored to be Secretary of State, his business ties led him to remove himself from consideration for cabinet positions and to serve as a personal lawyer to President Trump and later helped secure a pardon for Michael Milken.\nIn January 2017, President Trump began efforts to reduce illegal immigration by reallocating resources to border detention facilities and directing the hiring of 10,000 new ICE officers. <italic>McKinsey</italic>, previously contracted in 2015 under the Obama administration to help reorganize ICE\u2019s Enforcement & Removal Operations division, was redirected to assist with these new policies. The firm proposed reducing expenses on detainee food and medical care, which concerned ICE employees who feared these cuts would harm detainees. <italic>McKinsey</italic> also recommended speeding up deportations, raising alarms about potential violations of due process for migrants. Tensions surfaced in meetings between <italic>McKinsey</italic> consultants and ICE staff, with the latter questioning the human cost of these measures.\nSince Republican Congressman Eric Cantor became the first Jew to lead a chamber of Congress in 2011, New York Senator Charles Schumer became the first Jew to be the Senate Minority Leader in 2016. While Trump\u2019s son-in-law was Jewish, Trump\u2019s campaign aired an ad mocking Lloyd Blankfein, Janet Yellen, and George Soros, emboldening White supremacists. After demonstrators in Charlottesville chanted antisemitic and anti-Black slogans while carrying torches in August 2017, the shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue claiming eleven lives in 2018, and a San Diego synagogue was attacked, resulting in one death and several injuries, including a rabbi, during Passover the following year. Prior to the Pittsburgh massacre, the attacker had subscribed to antisemitic, White nationalist conspiracy theories that Jews incite \u2018hatred against Whites\u2019 and support minority immigration to alter Western demographics. But as left-wing Israel divestment protests spread through colleges, Trump reaffirmed the <italic>Civil Rights Act of 1964</italic> against antisemitism in 2019.\nMeanwhile, as four Black Congressmen called on Yellen for identity diversity in 2017, Obama\u2019s housing policy official Raphael Bostic became the first Black and openly gay person to lead a regional FRS bank when he was appointed as the president of FRS <italic>Atlanta</italic>. The following year, Mary Daly, who had been with FRS <italic>San Francisco</italic> since 1996, became the first openly gay woman to lead a regional FRS bank. \nAfter Theresa May became Britain\u2019s second female and first Anglo-Catholic PM in 2017, her successor, Boris Johnson, became the first baptized Roman Catholic to hold the office. After Bulgarian-born daughter of a civil engineer, Kristalina Georgieva, took charge of the EU budget at the <italic>European Commission</italic>, she left to become CEO of <italic>BANK</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> <italic>International Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> in 2017. \nBecoming the first female (interim) president of <italic>BANK</italic> in 2019, Georgieva left to become the first person from an emerging market to lead IMF as Christine Lagarde became ECB\u2019s first female lead. But all 19 <italic>euro</italic> country governors were men. After appointing Indian-born <italic>Harvard</italic> Professor Gita Gopinath to be IMF\u2019s first Chief Economist in 2019, Georgieva promoted Gopinath as her First Deputy in 2022. \nAs Britons voted to leave the EU in 2019 in Brexit, RBS promoted Alison Rose to CEO and the first woman to lead a large British bank. Since acquiring <italic>NatWest</italic> in 2000 and <italic>ABN Amro</italic> in 2007, RBS required a \u00a345 billion <italic>Exchequer</italic> bailout during the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>. In response, RBS downsized from 109,000 employees in 2013 to 66,600 by 2019, and exited 26 of the 28 countries she operated in. \nUnlike in America, <italic>Exchequer</italic> incurred massive losses after reducing her RBS stake, including \u00a32.1 billion loss when selling from 70.1 to 62.4% in 2018 and another \u00a31.1 billion from 61.7% to 59.8% in 2021. Over this period, Rose oversaw RBS\u2019 rebranding to <italic>NatWest</italic> in 2020 and introduced policies, such as paternity leave and halting new financing for oil and gas companies without credible climate transition plans. Accepting an invitation from <italic>Exchequer</italic> to review barriers to female entrepreneurship, Rose collaborated with <italic>McKinsey</italic> to develop the report. \nSince Stephanie Cohen became <italic>Goldman</italic> Partner in 2014, she transitioned to Chief Strategy Officer in 2018. As David Solomon became CEO of <italic>Goldman</italic> that year, Cohen drove the <italic>Launch With GS</italic> initiative, committing $500 million of firm and client capital to companies led, founded, and owned by women. Joining the <italic>Management Committee</italic>, Cohen was the youngest member, about a decade younger than the average member.\nUpon retiring as CEO of <italic>Pepsi</italic> in 2018 after 12 years, Indra Nooyi stressed<italic> Pepsi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> commitment to women and environmental justice. After <italic>Pepsi</italic>, Nooyi joined <italic>Amazon</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> board\u2014becoming the second woman of color to do so in 2019, alongside <italic>Starbucks</italic> CEO Rosalind Brewer\u2014as <italic>Amazon </italic>faced backlash related to employee compensation and consumerism-driven pollution. Since Nooyi became the 11th woman leading an S&P\u2019s 500 in 2006, the number grew to 25 by 2018. As male executives replaced Nooyi and five other women who had resigned\u2014including <italic>Campbell Soup</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Denise Morrison, <italic>Mattel</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Margo Georgiadis, <italic>Avon</italic>\u2019s Sherilyn McCoy, <italic>Mondelez</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Irene Rosenfeld, and <italic>Hewlett-Packard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s </italic>Meg Whitman\u2014the number of female CEOs at major firms fell by a quarter. In some instances, activist investors found female leaders to be easier targets. \nDespite Nooyi\u2019s lofty words, <italic>Pepsi</italic> continued polluting and while promoting women, hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> New Delhi\u2019s male Senior Partner Laxman Narasimhan, in various leadership roles, including CFO of Americas Foods, CEO of Latin America, CEO of Latin America, Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa operations, and Global Chief Commercial Officer. Like Nooyi, the Indian Brahmin diaspora prospered in America. Likewise, Anu Aiyengar served as <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Head of M&A. While <italic>SanDisk</italic> co-founder Sanjay Mehrotra resigned, he became CEO of <italic>Micron</italic> and Head of <italic>Semiconductor Industry Association</italic>. \nIndian twins Thomas and George Kurian studied at IIT <italic>Madras</italic> but transferred to <italic>Princeton Uni</italic> for engineering and then <italic>Stanford</italic> Business. Thomas joining <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 1992 and <italic>Oracle</italic> in 1998, where he held various senior roles. George, however, began at <italic>Cisco</italic>, moved to <italic>Akamai</italic>, and joined <italic>NetApp</italic> in 2011. George was appointed CEO of <italic>NetApp</italic> in 2015, overseeing the company\u2019s shift to a cloud-first strategy. By 2018, brother Thomas became CEO of <italic>Google</italic> Cloud under Pichai, who became CEO of <italic>Google</italic>\u2019s<italic> Alphabet</italic> HC in 2019. \nIn India, as a fifth generation of the wealthy Nehru political dynasty presided over the opposing Indian National Congress Party, Indian marriages shifted from caste to plutocracy. In 2018, Isha Ambani, daughter of India\u2019s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, married Anand Piramal, who developed his father\u2019s rural health-care initiative into a conglomerate. The wedding guests included entertainers and politicians, like Hillary Clinton. (Other Ambani wed real estate, mining, energy, and health magnates.) \nAs the Indian America population grew by nearly 150% between 2000 and 2018 into America\u2019s second-largest immigrant group, Trump and Romney both won only 16% of the Indian vote in 2012 and 2016. Although liberal world leaders distanced themselves from Trump\u2019s racist immigration policies, India\u2019s President Modi included him for rallies in Texas and Gujarat. Hindu nationalism grew more autocratic and revoked Muslim liberties and spurred Sikh separatism as social media broke down caste barriers within Hinduism in India after decades of caste affirmative action. But caste discrimination emerged as a serious issue in America\u2019s tech sector. California Civil Rights Department sued <italic>Cisco</italic> in 2020, accusing the company of paying a Dalit engineer less and offering fewer opportunities due to his caste. Over 250 complaints of caste discrimination at other tech firms followed.\nWith FA2010 and anti-money laundering compliance, banks retreated from risky correspondents. So, low-tax, blockchain-enabled crypto-currencies\u2014mainly <italic>Bitcoin</italic> and <italic>Ether</italic>\u2014grew payments using subsidized Chinese coal-based electricity, worsening security, inflation, and climate. While <italic>PayPal </italic>and other money transmitters transferred funds using accounting entries on their own balance sheets, cryptos allowed for value transfer without intermediaries. \nWhen Korean regulations created a premium on <italic>bitcoin </italic>in 2017, Sam Bankman-Fried started a hedge fund\u2014<italic>Alameda</italic>\u2014to arbitrage <italic>bitcoin</italic> from Japan for sale over his FTX crypto exchange. Sam also had the backing of his parents, both professor as <italic>Stanford </italic>Law. While Joseph Bankman taught tax and mental-health law, he consulted for FTX in both paid and charity projects. Barbara Fried taught law and economics while advising Democratic donors using \u2018rigorous research.\u2019 Her sister, Linda was the dean of <italic>Columbia </italic>Public Health. \nLike his family, Sam and FTX\u2019s leadership purported commitment to donating their money under the banner of \u2018effective altruism.\u2019 One was Caroline Ellison, the Catholic daughter of an MIT economics professor (where SEC Chair Gary Gensler had once taught a blockchain course), studied math at <italic>Stanford</italic>. She gained experience through internships at <italic>Jane Street</italic> before joining <italic>Alameda</italic> as a trader and Sam\u2019s girlfriend, became its CEO by late 2021. (Despite Sam\u2019s insistence to hedge <italic>Alameda</italic> investments, Caroline did not.) \nWhile entertainer private investors like Kevin O\u2019Leary accepted these family links as proof of compliance in the unregulated crypto market, less informed celebrities hawked cryptos for profited (like social media allowed them to do with public policy generally.) While Sam donated $40 to Democrats, FTX COO Ryan Salame donated $24 million to Republicans, including over-limits to his wife Michelle Bond\u2019s run for Congress, after she led lobbying firm <italic>Association for Digital Assets Markets</italic> in DC with FTX support. Gary Wang and Nishad Singh rounded out FTX\u2019s diverse leadership.\nMeanwhile, Black banks continued to disappear. Although FRS had launched the <italic>Partnership for Progress</italic> to support and preserve minority-owned banks in 2008, the number of Black-owned banks fell from 48 in 2001 to 18 in 2020. Although <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> of Memphis survived, Jesse Turner sold the headquarters in exchange for equity and deposits and resigned having led for three decades after taking over from his father. Despite constituting America\u2019s largest minority (16%), Black\u2019s share of MWO deposit equity capital collapsed. Before long, the split was Asian (55.2%), Hispanic (40.4%), Native American (2.4%), Black (2.0%), and Multiracial (0.1%). Moreover, Asian banks became more power as <italic>Cathay Bank </italic>bought <italic>SinoPac</italic> <italic>Far East</italic> NB in 2017.\nWhile Asian trade stimulated Asian banks, <italic>Tri-State Bank</italic> and other Black banks had made loans to Black churches for decades. But in late 2017, the Congressionally-chartered non-profit <italic>National Trust for Historic Preservation</italic> launched its <italic>African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund</italic> with partners including <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic>, <italic>Ford Foundation</italic>, and <italic>Picower Foundation</italic> (run by the widow of <italic>Madoff</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s accountant) to protect Black cultural heritage sites. Raising over $91 million within five years, the fund supported 242 preservation projects, including churches, colleges, artwork, and other historic monuments of pride and resistance. \nAlong with Black-owned banks, banks generally decreased in majority-Black neighborhoods by 14.6% since 2010. <italic>Morgan </italic>reduced its branch presence in these areas by 22.8% from 2010 to 2018, compared to a 0.2% decline in the rest of America. Although FA2010 had mandated SEC, UST\u2019s OCC, FRS, FDIC, CFPB, and <italic>National Credit Union Administration</italic> establish <italic>Offices of Minority & Women Inclusion</italic> (\u201cOMWIs\u201d) to oversee diversity matters and develop standards for assessing diversity policies of entities regulated by them, FA2010 steered big banks away from majority-Black exurban areas and other risky investments by capping big bank debit card fee profits to protect consumers. As small banks credit constricted, Black business switched to fintech nonbanks to meet liquidity.\nJoining <italic>Koch </italic>in lobbying against taxes, Soros\u2019 <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic> funded criminal justice reform at the municipal election level from 2015. Pivoting from national elections, Soros directed millions of dollars into local elections for district attorney and other campaigns across multiple states, focusing on candidates who aimed to reform the justice system by reducing racial disparities in sentencing and implementing diversion programs for drug offenders. His contributions, along with support from organizations like the ACLU, <italic>Real Justice</italic>, and <italic>Color of Change</italic>, targeting races nationwide.\n<italic>McKinsey</italic> also advised New York City <italic>Rikers Island</italic> prison. In early 2014, media reports revealed escalating violence at <italic>Rikers Island</italic>, prompting DOJ to threaten legal action. New York City responded by contracting <italic>McKinsey</italic> in September 2014 to address the violence. By early 2015, <italic>McKinsey</italic> had established <italic>Restart</italic> units at <italic>George Motchan Detention Center</italic>. These units initially reported a significant reduction in violence. \nHowever, investigations revealed by November 2015, that data were manipulated and that <italic>Restart</italic> units were populated with inmates selected to minimize violence. Later analysis revealed that violence at <italic>Rikers</italic> had risen by nearly 50% during <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s tenure. In November 2016, <italic>McKinsey</italic> and <italic>Department of Correction</italic> barred young adults from <italic>Restart</italic> units to further manage violence. <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s contract ended in April 2017 amid findings of data manipulation and coding errors. <italic>New York City Council</italic> decided to close <italic>Rikers Island</italic> in October 2017, and <italic>George Motchan Detention Center</italic>, where <italic>Restart</italic> was piloted, closed by March 2018.\nAlong with genuine riots in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s election, <italic>Make the Road</italic> and similar Soros\u2019 <italic>Open Societies</italic>-funded grassroots organizations swiftly mobilized and coordinated social-media broadcast protests. Numerous organizations emerged post-election, aiming to channel anti-Trump activism beyond the Democratic Party\u2019s confines, bolstered by grassroots volunteers, modest budgets, and increased attention from wealthy left-wing donors. <italic>Democracy Alliance</italic>, known for steering significant funds to established groups like the Soros-seeded <italic>Center for American Progress </italic>(\u201cCAP\u201d), hired Archana Sahgal, a former Obama <italic>Office of Public Engagement </italic>official and <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic><italic> </italic>program manager, fund newer anti-Trump entities. \nOne of these, <italic>Indivisible</italic>, soon backing from <italic>LinkedIn</italic> creator Reid Hoffman, George Soros, San Francisco mortgage magnate Herbert Sandler, New York real estate heiress Patricia Bauman, oil heiress Leah Hunt-Hendrix. Hoffman\u2019s aggressive spending since 2017 aligned him with top Democratic donors, yet criticism arose due to his funding of groups involved in disinformation tactics during Virginia\u2019s 2017 political races. \nAgainst Hungarian walls against African and Middle Eastern refugees and Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, <italic>Open Society</italic>, <italic>Tides</italic>, and other non-profits<italic> </italic>funded fiscal sponsors for disparate groups of Marxists and historically oppressed groups to tap antiquated notions of colonialism in a united grassroot voting campaign. Along with anti-colonial and -capitalist propaganda, they funded <italic>Adalah Justice Project</italic>, which advocated for the destruction of Israel\u2019s border fence, and <italic>Samidoun</italic>, which fundraised for PLO\u2019s terrorist factions. Similar ethnically charged non-profits sponsored rallies advocating unequivocal support for \u2018oppressed\u2019 <italic>Hamas</italic> to liberate \u201cPalestinians\u201d, like Malcolm X had with PLO when calling Black Americans to unite with Marxist anti-colonial revolutionaries across Africa, Latin America, and Asia in the 1960s.\nAlthough some Africans had welcomed colonizers for developing infrastructure, advancing education and healthcare systems, establishing legal and political institutions, and protecting women and conquered people from traditional slavery, negative perceptions of colonialism intensified due as Marxist critiques of capitalist exploitation of laborers. Despite the end of the <italic>Cold War</italic>, politics continued to push an apologetic view of colonial oppression. \nInstead, tax funded (or advantaged) organizations funded everything from aid to political institutions. When Dambisa Moyo\u2014a Zambian PhD with stints at <italic>BANK</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2014argued that these nonprofits crowded out private investment, <italic>Gates Foundation</italic> accused her of \u2018promoting evil.\u2019 Meanwhile, Bill Gates met frequently with registered sex-offender Jeffrey Epstein, who organized meetings with members of the <italic>Noble Peace Prize</italic> committee and other contacts.\nBig media was no different. As the 6th generation owner to inherit the editorship of <italic>New York Times</italic> in 2016, Arthur Sulzberger was raised in his mother\u2019s Episcopalian faith and later stopped practicing religion. Following Trump\u2019s victory, a generational divide tore through <italic>New York Times</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> newsroom, with younger staff members feeling their concerns, principally racial diversity and social media policies, were not adequately addressed by senior staff. \nControversy arose over the hiring of conservative pundits for the op-ed section, while at the same time Sulzberger shifted from investigative reporters to social media. Among the new \u2018woke\u2019 projects was <italic>1619 Project</italic>, to reframe American history as being driven by Black slavery and White supremacy rather than religion freedom. Despite being panned for factual errors, cherry-picking facts, and ideological bias, <italic>New York Times</italic> argued that such a retelling reflects the ongoing struggle for racial equality. Without regard to income inequality and reinforcing a victimization narrative, the goal was to funnel voters to a single party, and refusing to cover any issues outside of their ideological dogma \nThe 2018 midterm election marked the most expensive in history, with a 35% increase from 2014. The significant surge in funds from wealthy donors fueled a \u2018blue wave\u2019 Democrats with record turnout among Democratic-leaning demographics. One of the winners was Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Latina <italic>Boston Uni</italic> graduate, who protested in <italic>Occupy Wall Street</italic> and other activism before bartending in the Bronx. Along with social media, Ocasio-Cortez won with management from Saikat Chakrabarti. Born in Texas to Brahmin immigrants, Chakrabarti studied computer science at <italic>Harvard</italic> and worked at <italic>Bridgewater</italic> hedge fund before becoming wealthy as one of <italic>Stripe</italic>\u2019s early engineers. \nOcasio-Cortez soon formed an alliance with several other Chakrabarti-endorsees, mainly Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib. As Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Chief of Staff, Chakrabarti aggressively advocated for the Green New Deal. With a minimum focus on climate added at the end, the initiative emphasized government intervention in changing the economy for social justice. When Ocasio-Cortez and her few allies staged sit-ins to gain support, they used social media to accuse Speaker Pelosi of singling out newly elected non-White women. Similarly, Chakrabarti accused centrist Democrats of enabling a \u2018racist system.\u2019 \nIn New York City, the demographic composition of public-school students highlighted significant racial disparities, with a majority being Black and Hispanic students, while a notable portion of those in gifted programs were mostly low-income Asians, who supplemented their education outside of school. Identifying this competition as segregation, Mayor Bill DeBlasio appointed Richard Carranza, a Texan and the grandson of Mexican immigrants, to lead the city\u2019s Department of Education in 2019. Carranza alleged supremacist values and appointed Black men to replace White female executives. He also mandated DEI trainings aimed at advocating for the advancement of middle-class Black children over low-income Whites. Facing opposition from Republican and Asian communities, Carranza failed to eliminate gifted programs and shift admissions for specialized programs away from fair standardized testing to equitable neighborhood-based criteria.\nSince <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s first Black Chair, Richard Parsons joined co-racial Vernon Jordan on <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s board in 2012, he became Lead Director by 2018. The same year, <italic>Citi</italic> promoted her first Black CFO, Mark Mason. Raised in Queens, began working in his grandparents\u2019 businesses as a teenager and joined <italic>Citi</italic> in 2001. He soon gained attention from then-CEO Charles Prince, who appointed him chief of staff. Over the years, Mason led <italic>Citi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Private Bank, the \u201cbad bank\u201d for toxic mortgages, and managed <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s annual stress tests for FRS. By 2019, Maxine Waters became Chair of the House Financial Services Committee and FRS amended FA2010 to reduced regulations for medium-sized banks with under $100 billion in assets. \nSince successfully lobbying against regulation tightening in 2013, <italic>BlackRock </italic>hired Adewale Adeyemo, formerly of the Democratic <italic>Hamilton </italic>think-tank and<italic> </italic>Obama Administration, in 2017 as a senior advisor and, at one point, as the interim Chief of Staff to CEO Larry Fink. While Adeyemo left <italic>BlackRock</italic> to lead <italic>Obama Foundation</italic> in 2019,<italic> BlackRock</italic> once again secured exemption from heightened scrutiny during the Trump administration as UST Secretary Mnuchin hired former <italic>BlackRock</italic> managing director Craig Phillips as Counselor.\nAlso in 2017, <italic>BlackRock </italic>hired Obama\u2019s environmental lead and OMB Deputy Director Brian Deese as Head of Sustainable Investing. By 2019, <italic>BlackRock</italic> promoted <italic>McKinsey</italic> alum Salim Ramji from Head of US Wealth Advisory to Global Head of iShares & Index Investing in 2019, accounting for two-thirds of <italic>BlackRock</italic>\u2019s revenue.  While<italic> BlackRock</italic>, <italic>State Street</italic>, and other money managers cited <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s DEI research by Vivian Hunt for including <italic>social</italic> factors in asset management,<italic> </italic><italic>BlackRock</italic> forced corporations to report <italic>environmental</italic> risks to climate along with FRS without Congress as <italic>BlackRock</italic> FMA shaped the sustainable finance rules<italic> </italic>for <italic>European Commission</italic>. \nWhile the \u2018S\u2019 of <italic>Environmental, Social, & Governance </italic>(\u201cESG\u201d) funds fostered DEI, the \u2018E\u2019 addressed climate change concerns but were also subject to Chakrabarti-like focus on for selective social justice. As KKR touted ESG and employee LBOs, <italic>Fortress</italic>, along with private equity and banking shareholder litigation for patents and torts, loaned funds to civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who represented the families of George Floyd, Trayvon Martin, and Breonna Taylor.\nBut as banks retreated from energy, independent oil and gas drillers competed and collapsed with government lockdowns in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. As <italic>BlackRock</italic> FMA advised FRS and other central banks, <italic>BlackRock</italic> managed their bond portfolios. When <italic>European Commission</italic> contracted <italic>BlackRock</italic> FMA to develop guidelines for ESG risks for EU\u2019s banks in 2020, NGOs and Europe\u2019s Ombudsman accused <italic>BlackRock</italic> of a conflict of interest. Despite the criticism, the nearly year-long study found European banks were slow in addressing sustainability and understanding ESG risks, enhancing <italic>BlackRock</italic>\u2019s role as an advisor and asset manager in guiding banks through sustainable finance initiatives. \nAround a quarter of <italic>BlackRock</italic>\u2019s America focused ESG fund primarily invested in technology (<italic>Microsoft</italic>, <italic>Apple</italic>, NVIDIA, <italic>Alphabet</italic>, <italic>Meta</italic>, <italic>Tesla</italic>, <italic>Adobe</italic>, <italic>Broadcom</italic>) as well as <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Coca Cola</italic>, <italic>Pepsi</italic>, <italic>Eli Lilly</italic>,<italic> </italic>and <italic>Home Depot</italic>. Among the winning ESG investors was  <italic>Generation Investment Management</italic>, co-founded by former VP Al Gore in 2005 after his failed bid for the presidency and <italic>Goldman</italic> Asset Management head David Blood, whose father had been vice president and treasurer of <italic>Ford</italic> Credit.\nAs banks stopped financing dirty energy, producers moved to higher-cost private capital and had fewer incentives and less ability to invest in cleaner technology. Likewise, renewable supply chains fueled slavery. Moreover, <italic>United Nations</italic>-backed <italic>Science Based Targets Initiative</italic>, S&P and <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s investment arm funded <italic>Adani</italic> to develop renewable energy plans. In Britain, steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta borrowed \u00a3400 million in loans from supply chain financier <italic>Greensill Capital</italic>\u2014founded by the Australian entrepreneur Lex Greensill and advised by the former PM David Cameron\u2014through Britain\u2019s <italic>COVID Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme</italic>. While the government scheme guaranteed 80% of <italic>Greensill</italic>\u2019s loans, Gupta\u2019s companies manipulated their structure to exceed a \u00a350 million cap on loans to a single entity. \nWhile Obama\u2019s healthcare reform ACA reduced discrepancies between industries, lockdowns in response to COVID disrupted employment disproportionally by sectors after 2019, renewing the need for value-based service. While <italic>BlackRock</italic> focused on climate risk, deaths from legal narcotics grew. Following <italic>Purdue Pharma</italic> in 2019, <italic>Mallinckrodt</italic> filed for bankruptcy protection. Having previously divested its narcotics business, <italic>Johnson & Johnson</italic> settled numerous lawsuits related to its opioid marketing practices. Firing Arnab Ghatak as evidence arose that he purged documents in 2018, <italic>McKinsey</italic> agreed to settle state investigations into its role in boosting opioid sales without admitting wrongdoing by 2021. DOJ investigations continued. While advising international tobacco clients, including <italic>Altria</italic>, <italic>Imperial Brands</italic>, <italic>British American Tobacco</italic>, and <italic>Japan Tobacco International</italic>, <italic>McKinsey</italic> assisted <italic>Juul</italic>\u2019s legal defense through <italic>Sidley Austin</italic> to secure attorney-client privilege. Before <italic>Juul</italic> settled state lawsuits over youth marketing for $438.5 million in 2022, <italic>McKinsey</italic> ceased all consulting for tobacco and vaping companies in 2020. \nSince FA10 capped big bank debit card fee profits to protect consumers, <italic>Morgan </italic>and other banks de-risked and closed unprofitable branches. Unlike EESA, FRS eschewed judicial review as 1938\u2019s <italic>Administrative Procedure Act</italic> did not extend to FRS. Likewise, when FA2010 created <italic>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</italic> (\u201cCFB\u201d) within FRS and CFPB sought to eliminate usurious payday lenders, DOJ initiated Operation Choke Point in 2013 to circumvent due process by targeting payment processors and financial institutions that facilitated transactions. \nThe program pressured banks into cutting off financial services and \u201cdebank\u201d to businesses deemed to be involved in fraud, such as payday lenders, or politically unpalatable, such as gambling, guns, or pornography, without directly prosecuting them. In 2017, the Trump Administration ended Operation Choke Point, citing concerns that it had become a politically motivated effort to shut down legal industries, including payday lenders and gun retailers, without due process. \nAlthough FA2010 mandated central clearing for most investments, UST bonds continued trading OTC. Likewise, FA2010 required large foreign banks to ringfence American bank operations, which Europe mirrored by 2019. As foreigners ran from UST debt amidst COVID in the <italic>Panic of 2020</italic>, private dealers could not shift capital across borders, forcing FRS to buy a trillion dollars\u2019 worth, re-open 2008 facilities to buy MBS, discount CP, and swap FX with global central banks to allow foreigners access to <italic>dollars</italic>. As FRS bought municipal and corporate debt, Congress enacted the <italic>Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security</italic> <italic>Act</italic> (\u201cCARES\u201d). \nWhen consumer demand collapsed with COVID, Congress guaranteed small business loans with the <italic>Paycheck Protection Program</italic> (\u201cPPP\u201d) as part of CARES. Likewise, Congress created the <italic>Employee Retention Tax Credit</italic> (\u201cERC\u201d) to incentivize employers to keep their workers on payroll during lockdowns. Under this program, eligible employers could claim a refundable tax credit equal to 50% of employee wages and healthcare expenses if their operations experienced a revenue decline of over 50% compared to 2019. \nThe maximum payout per employee was capped at $5,000 for the year 2020. Few employers utilized ERC, preferring forgivable PPP loans. Within months, Congress extended and expanded ERC, reducing the revenue decline threshold to 20% and allowing employers to claim up to $7,000 per employee per quarter, even if they received PPP loans. However, PPP initially excluded nonbanks, squeezing Blacks. While Congress modified the program to aid disadvantaged groups, they excluded the Black-heavy informal economy by limiting the loans to registered businesses. protests rocked the nation.\nAs prominent Black <italic>Harvard</italic> economics professor Roland Fryer published research debunking racial disparities in officer-involved shootings, the accidental police killing of unemployed and heavily intoxicated George Floyd for using a forged bill ignited <italic>Black Lives Matter</italic> police protests. These demonstrations, which reverberated across America, led to a renewed focus on statues of Confederates, Christopher Columbus, and other symbols of White supremacy and racial injustice. Despite facing challenges such as stringent state monument laws and fears of White supremacist backlash, several Confederate statues were removed during the summer of 2020. While President Trump\u2019s executive order penalized vandalism against monuments, grassroots protests and acts of vandalism continued unabated.\nOften with poor or no impact measurement, Soros\u2019 <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic>, <italic>Rockefeller Foundation</italic>, <italic>Ford Foundation</italic>, <italic>Gates Foundation</italic>, joined celebrities, <italic>Facebook</italic> investors and\u2014after divorcing <italic>Amazon</italic>\u2019s Bezos\u2014McKenzie Williams, in funding equity diversity initiatives challenging \u2018unjust capitalism.\u2019  Along with bail reform challenging judicial operations and shuttering detention centers, the election of Alvin Bragg, New York\u2019s first Black Attorney General and similar progressive officials practiced \u2018restorative justice\u2019 by refusing to prosecute \u2018minor\u2019 offenses by minorities. As a result, urban crime rates soared, chain and MWO-led businesses shuttered. While retailers reported about $100 billion in inventory losses in 2022, New York City\u2019s public transport lost $0.7 billion to fare hoppers. Likewise, Britain\u2019s 2014 reclassification of theft under \u00a3200 as a summary offense has contributed to record shoplifting incidents. Organized crimes combined with limited police resources and rising crime prevention costs, has led to store closures.\nIn America, such misdemeanors were often targeted at Chinese and Jewish communities. Multiple prominent Black entertainers perpetuated antis-Semitic stereotypes, echoing ancient rhetoric that Jews possess excessive power and wealth, while also misrepresenting the racist nature of the Holocaust. Despite a generally higher income among the average Jewish American compared to other groups, up to a quarter of Jews faced difficulties covering basic expenses. By 2021, incidents of antisemitic harassment, vandalism, and assault reached the highest rate in four decades of record keeping.\nAs 85% of banks responding to a FDIC survey in 2020 implemented DEI programs, minority representation from 33 to 46% (11 to 18% in management) and women in management positions from 34% to 48%. Likewise, the FA2012-required <italic>Office of Minority & Women\u2019s Initiatives</italic> of UST\u2019s <italic>Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</italic> cited <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s research in calling for \u201cdiverse\u201d bank and regulator leadership. Between 2020 and 2021, 94% of jobs added by S&P 100 companies went to non-Whites, doubling the rate in executive and managerial positions. \nWhile <italic>Goldman</italic> had committed to increase the requirement for diverse boards from one to two directors by 2021 since announcing their partnership with <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 2020, they increased this requirement to three board members, including one woman. By 2021, S&P 500 boards appointed 456 new directors, the most since 2004, with 47% from underrepresented groups, with a threefold increase in Black to 11%, while women\u2019s representation decreased to 43%. Up from 28% in 2020, 35% of directors were first time directors, with 86% being women or minorities. \nAs <italic>Goldman</italic> veteran Regina Green took over<italic> Launch With GS </italic>in 2021, <italic>Goldman</italic> also launched the <italic>One Million Black Women</italic> initiative, pledging $10 billion in investment and $100 million in philanthropic aid over 10-years. By year end, <italic>BlackRock</italic> cited <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s DEI study as they forced corporate boards to have a third of diverse members. Since Nigerian-born <italic>McKinsey</italic>-alum Titi Cole became EVP and Head of Operations at <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> in 2017, she laterally transferred to <italic>Citi</italic> in 2020. Over the following two years, she became the became the first Black woman on <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s executive management team and oversaw consumer business outside of America. Monetized, elite minorities set record turnovers by rotating among employers that promised to raise DEI hires. \nAfter one year in the Trump Administration, former head of <italic>Goldman Foundation</italic> Dina Habib returned to <italic>Goldman</italic> in 2018, joining the Management Committee and Head of Sovereign Clients. Her Arabic skills secured <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s co-lead role in the 2019 Saudi<italic> Aramco</italic> IPO, the biggest ever. Habib\u2019s replacement, Guyanese-born Asahi Pompey became Global Head of Corporate Engagement and President of <italic>Goldman Foundation</italic>, leading the firm\u2019s community engagement initiatives, such as <italic>10,000 Small Businesses</italic>, <italic>10,000 Women</italic>, <italic>One Million Black Women</italic>, <italic>Goldman Gives</italic>, <italic>Community TeamWorks</italic>, and the <italic>Community Reinvestment Act</italic> program, while serving on the Management and Global Inclusion & Diversity committees. \nSince Stephanie Cohen started <italic>Launch with GS </italic>a year earlier, the program pivoted to include Black and Hispanic entrepreneurs, and doubled in size to $1 billion in 2019. While technologist Martin Chavez retired from <italic>Goldman </italic>by 2019, and joined the boards of <italic>Santander</italic>, <italic>Google</italic>, and <italic>Sixth Steet Partners</italic>, Stephanie Cohen became co-Head of the <italic>Consumer & Wealth Management </italic>division in 2020, the only woman to lead one of the firm\u2019s 4 revenue divisions. \nThat year, <italic>Goldman</italic> committed to only assist companies in going public in America and Western Europe if they had at least one diverse board member. To actively promote diversity on corporate boards, they partnered with <italic>McKinsey</italic> to create <italic>Spotlight </italic>to push diverse candidates for their first corporate board positions. As NASDAQ cited <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s evidence to make board diversity a requirement for listing, former Chair Arthur Levitt called such an action political at its core. SEC approved the rule several months later. By 2021, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> pledged to increase Black and Hispanic executives in America by 50%, tied diversity to manager performance reviews, and started a <italic>McKinsey</italic>-led leadership program for Black employees. \nLike the concentrated asset management industry led by <italic>BlackRock</italic>, <italic>Glass Lewis</italic> and <italic>Institutional Shareholder Services</italic> and dominated proxy voting for equities and pushed ESG and board diversity votes, both citing <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s studies for the latter. As they sought to change the management at <italic>Morgan</italic><italic> Chase</italic>, Jaime Dimon called out that they were a foreign-owned, for-profit duopoly, with former owned by Canadian private equity and the latter by <italic>McKinsey</italic>-influenced <italic>Deutsche B\u00f6rse</italic>.\nLikewise, <italic>McKinsey </italic>collaborated with payment monopoly <italic>Visa</italic> to increase underrepresented group representation in leadership by 50% by 2023 and overall employee diversity by 50% by 2025, which they did two years ahead of schedule. During this time, <italic>McKinsey</italic> alumni<italic> </italic>came to dominate <italic>Visa</italic>. Soon after <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s Head of Banking & Global Payments Oliver Jenkyn helped <italic>Visa</italic>\u2019s IPO in 2008, he became Group President of Global Markets. \nA <italic>McKinsey</italic> principal from 2000 to 2006, Ryan McInerney became CEO of Consumer Banking at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Chase</italic> until 2013, when he joined <italic>Visa</italic>, and became CEO in 2023. Charlotte Hogg consulted at <italic>McKinsey</italic> and was COO of BOE before joining <italic>Visa</italic> in 2017 as CEO for <italic>Visa</italic> Europe. Other additions from <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 2022 and 2023 include Global Head of Strategy Lisa Ellis, SVP Global Head of Innovation & Digital Partnerships Vanessa Colella, and VP Global Strategy John Abraham. By March 2024, <italic>Visa</italic>, <italic>Mastercard</italic>, and a select group of retailers agreed to antitrust settlement, decried by the larger industry as too small and subsequently rejected by the court.\nBefore McInerney, <italic>Visa</italic>\u2019s Chair and CEO Alfred Kelly was not a <italic>McKinsey</italic> alum, his career started at <italic>McKinsey</italic>-led <italic>Pepsi</italic> before he joined <italic>American Express</italic> in 1987. Even more than <italic>Pepsi</italic>, <italic>American Express</italic> was described by a former partner as \u201c<italic>McKinsey</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s subsidiary in many ways</italic>\u201d at the time. Like McInerney, <italic>McKinsey</italic> alums led <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Chase</italic>\u2019s payments. Beginning their careers at <italic>McKinsey</italic>, Takis Georgakopoulos and Max Neukirchen became banking partners before leaving to join <italic>Morgan</italic>. Georgakopoulos joined in 2007 as Head of Corporate Strategy, later serving as CFO, Global Head of MNC Coverage, Chief of Staff for the Corporate & Investment Bank, and Global Head of Payments. Neukirchen joined in 2013, first as Head of Strategy, then as Chief of Staff, CEO of Merchant Services, and Global Head of Payments & Commerce Solutions after Georgakopoulos.\nIn 2019, <italic>McKinsey</italic> hired Biden family friend and former <italic>Facebook</italic> lobbyist Louisa Terrell as Deputy General Counsel and Head of Public Affairs out of DC. While <italic>Facebook</italic> employed the daughter of Democratic Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer as a product manager, <italic>Amazon</italic> hired Schumer\u2019s other daughter as Senior Policy Manager the following year. She had worked at <italic>Robin Hood Foundation</italic> and various elections. Similarly, <italic>Morgan </italic>hired Heather Higginbottom as co-Head of Global Philanthropy in 2019 to focus on racial equity after she worked as COO at <italic>CARE</italic> for two years and at high-profile positions with USAID, OMB, and <italic>of </italic>State Department since 2009. <italic>Lazard </italic>Asset Management\u2019s Ashish Bhutani hired Nikita Singhal in New York and Jennifer Anderson in London to co-lead ESG.\nAs <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> invested $50 million in 6 Black-owned banks in Texas, Louisiana, Michigan, and Georgia\u2014including <italic>Citizens Trust Bank</italic> of Atlanta\u2014<italic>National Black Bank Fund</italic> organized a syndicate led by Atlanta-based <italic>Citizens Trust Bank</italic> and New York-based <italic>Carver</italic> to lend $25 million to <italic>Major League Soccer</italic>, the first time a sports league hired exclusively Black banks, by 2022. When Vernon Jordan died at 85 in 2021, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s remaining top Black banker William Lewis left for <italic>Apollo</italic> in 2022 while joining <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s board after 17 years. Celebrating her 175th anniversary in 2023, <italic>Lazard</italic> considered selling herself to Abu Dhabi but as talks fell through, poached <italic>Citi</italic>\u2019s Vice Chair Raymond McGuire, the son of an Ohio social worker, as her first Black President. \nBy 2021, <italic>Morgan </italic>hired Chuka Umunna as Head of ESG for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. His mother descended from Irish landowning lawyers, like Helenus Milmo, a British Court judge. His father, Bennett, was a Nigerian chief who moved to Britain in the 1960s to import-export. After Bennett\u2019s possible political assassination in 1992, Chuka finished prep school and <italic>Uni of Manchester</italic>, becoming a lawyer in London. \nWinning a <italic>Labour</italic> MP election in 2010, he served on the Treasury Select Committee, Head of <italic>Labour</italic>\u2019s Private Secretary, and <italic>Shadow Business Secretary</italic> by 2011. Calling for transparency in bankers\u2019 pay and <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s taxes, he was labeled the \u2018British Obama,\u2019 but dropped out of race for PM in 2015. As he supported a second Brexit vote, he left <italic>Labour</italic> to lead a pro-EU party. Lacking support, Chuka moved to <italic>Liberal Democrats</italic>, and unsuccessfully opposed the takeover of a British defense contractor by a <italic>Morgan</italic>-advised American LBO. Losing an election in 2019, he became co-lead of <italic>Edelman</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>ESG consultancy. \nAnother prominent Black executive born in Nigeria, was Damola Adamolekun, who was born in Nigeria and raised in Zimbabwe, the Netherlands, and America. After graduating <italic>Brown</italic> in 2011, Adamolekun worked as an investment banker at <italic>Goldman</italic> and private equity associate at TPG<italic> </italic>before <italic>Harvard</italic> Business. Becoming a Partner at <italic>Paulson</italic> in 2016, he joined the board of portfolio company <italic>PF Chang China Bistro</italic>, of which he became CEO from 2019. Leaving <italic>Paulson </italic>in late 2023, Adamolekun joined <italic>Fortress</italic>\u2019 portfolio company to lead the acquisition and restructuring of <italic>Red Lobster</italic>.\nFollowing decades of \u2018talented tenth\u2019 focused affirmative action and FRS-led dissolution of Black banks laden with church investments after the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, Black households owned less than 3% of national assets and 2% of MWO equity capital. So, <italic>Bank of America</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, <italic>Wells Fargo</italic>, <italic>Netflix</italic>, and <italic>Yelp</italic> joined nonprofits to raise funds for CDFIs, the Atlanta-based <italic>National Black Bank Foundation </italic>focusing on investing into Black-owned banks. <italic>Citi</italic> alone launched over a billion dollars on a three-year initiative to narrow the racial wage gap for Blacks, including $550 million for homeownership and affordable housing by minority developers and $350 million to procure from Black-owned business suppliers. <italic>Morgan </italic>soon launched a similar $30 billion five-year initiative as part of their ESG program. \nSuch programs continued decades of state and federal government preferences for minority and women-owned (\u201cMWO\u201d) supplier contracts. Since Missouri-born David Steward acquired an auditing firm for the transportation industry in 1983, his <italic>World Wide Technology</italic> (\u201cWWT\u201d). A significant contract to supply American troops in Bosnia in 1995 became available when <italic>General Electric</italic> lost the deal due to its failure to meet minority subcontracting targets. As WWT parlayed this contract to expand to federal agencies and major corporations, Steward became the richest Black American by the 2020s, ahead of <italic>Vista Equity Partners</italic>\u2019 Robert Smith. Since buying small defense contractor <italic>Sierra Nevada Corp</italic> (\u201cSNC\u201d) in 1988, Turkish immigrants Eren and Fatih Ozmen certified SNC into a woman-owned business, which allowed it to compete for federal contracts. By the 2020s, SNC was the largest woman-owned business made the Ozmens billionaires by winning contracts from larger publicly listed defense contractors.\nCorporations also implemented sponsorship programs, leadership development opportunities, and other DEI initiatives. Since 2020, the number of Black CEOs in the <italic>Fortune 500 </italic>doubled from four to eight by 2023. They include Rosalind Brewer of <italic>Walgreens Boots Alliance</italic>, Marvin Ellison of <italic>Lowe</italic>\u2019s, Thasunda Duckett of TIAA, Christopher Womack of <italic>Southern </italic>PUHC, Calvin Butler of <italic>Exelon</italic>, Franklin Clyburn of <italic>International Flavors & Fragrances</italic>, David Rawlinson of <italic>Qurate Retail</italic>, and Ren\u00e9 Jones of <italic>M&T Bank</italic>. While critics compared this representation of Black CEOs of 1.6 with the 13% labor force participation rate of Black Americans, American labor force is a poor denominator as many <italic>Fortune 500</italic> CEOs are foreigners. Along with serving on <italic>Alphabet</italic>\u2019s board, Roger Ferguson joined <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s new six-person External Advisory Group in 2023.\nDemocratic Senators Mark Warner, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer introduced a bill in 2020. Trump signed this this law consolidated with other legislation, which allocating $12 billion in capital, liquidity, and operational capacity to MWOs and CDFIs minority and rural communities. (While a Black scholar advocated for changes to inheritance for polyandrous relationships to protect wealth for matrilineal subcultures, the topic was more taboo than large federal wealth transfers.)\nBetween 2019 and 2020, financial institutions saw significant increases in minority and women representation. Of the institutions assessed in 2019, 72% participated again in 2020. The data revealed a notable rise in minority representation in both the overall workforce and management. Among institutions in both assessment periods, minority workforce representation increased by 13%, reaching 46%, while minority representation in management rose by 7%, reaching 18%. During the same period, women\u2019s representation in management surged from 34 to 48%.\nBetween 2019 and 2023, Black and Hispanic unemployment rates significantly decreased, with Black unemployment reaching its lowest level in history by 2023. Labor force participation rates for prime-aged Black and Hispanic women also surged to historic highs during this period. Real earnings for the median Black worker grew by 7%, outpacing overall median worker growth, while median Hispanic worker earnings increased by almost 4%. Additionally, median family wealth for both Black and Hispanic households soared from 2019 to 2022. Homeownership rates for both groups increased, and business ownership rates, particularly among Blacks, reached historic highs by 2022.\nTo counter Trump in the 2020 presidential race, former President Obama\u2019s moderate VP Joseph Biden faced a challenge. After representing Delaware in the Senate since 1973, Biden volunteered to lie about his academic achievements in the 1989 presidential campaign, forcing him to abandon his bid at the time. Remaining in the Senate, his son Hunter lobbied Congress repeatedly until Joseph became VP in 2008. After accumulating over decades of federal \u2018service\u2019, Joseph Biden aligned with Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 socialist wing to appeal to progressive voters. (Like ethics, neurological health was insignificant. To secure Senate votes, Democrats elected Pennsylvania\u2019s John Fetterman post-stroke in 2022 and maintained the shingles-debilitated Dianne Feinstein in California in 2023.) While Trump raised funds from new wealthy taxpayers and grew his share of the Indian and Asian vote from 16 to 30%, it was not enough.\nFor his VP running mate, Biden picked the California Senator Kamala Harris, who became the first female, Black, and Indian to do so. After blaming election fraud for his loss, Trump and his allies were indicted under RICO in 2023 for allegedly causing an insurrection in storming the Capital. While Trump and his allies filed dozens of lawsuits, some were procedurally dismissed for being filed after the fact, while those that were evaluated on their merits were primarily rejected due to the plaintiffs\u2019 inability to meet the substantial burden of proof required in election law cases. Later, other Trump enemies, like New York\u2019s Attorney General won a lawsuit against him for reporting financial that resulted in massive penalties and led the Governor to reassure businesses of the political nature of the judgement.\nAs America\u2019s second Catholic President since Kennedy, Biden named Yellen as the first female UST Secretary in 2020 over Roger Ferguson. As Yellen and other Democrats were critical of the Trump administration\u2019s approach, <italic>BlackRock</italic> was concerned about regulatory requirements that they had defeated in 2013 and 2019. However, President-elect Biden soon appointed Brian Deese, who was responsible for sustainable investing for Obama and then at <italic>BlackRock</italic>, to lead <italic>National Economic Council</italic>, and Adewale Adeyemo, <italic>BlackRock</italic>\u2019s former Chief of Staff, as Deputy Secretary. (Replacing Adeyemo as CEO of <italic>Obama Foundation</italic> was Valerie Jarrett, whose cousin was. Married to <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Vernon Jordan.) To direct the White House Office of Legislative Affairs, Biden chose his son\u2019s childhood friend Louisa Terrell, who had previously led public policy for <italic>Facebook</italic> and <italic>McKinsey</italic>. \nBiden\u2019s Executive Order 13985 mandated racial equity across the federal government without Congress, which functioned as preferences. Along with setting a 15% quota for federal procurement to MWO businesses, all federal agencies were directed to involve civil rights officers in decision-making. In his pursuit of a historically diverse Cabinet, Biden appointed Katherine Tai, the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, the first non-White woman to represent American trade, and Department<italic> </italic>of Transportation\u2019s Pete Buttigieg as the first open gay (with a stint at <italic>McKinsey</italic>). \nAs Lina Khan became the youngest-ever FTC Chair, Deb Haaland of a military family became the first Native American to lead the Department<italic> </italic>of the Interior. Similarly, Biden appointed Shalanda Young, a Black Congressional staffer, to the number two position at OMB and the top position the following year. While women accounted for 60% of staff, complaints remained that less visible roles did not reflect those who voted for Biden (double the national rate as few Blacks voted Republican). \nIn 2021, Janis Bowdler, President of <italic>Morgan </italic>Foundation, became UST\u2019s first-ever Counselor for Racial Equity. Under Executive Order 13985, the Department<italic> </italic>of Education prioritized racial equity, emphasizing the significance of incorporating anti-racist practices into teaching, using <italic>New York Times</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> 1619 Project</italic> and similar resources. However, caste, experience, and political diversity were less important than optics. Like he stumped a Trump appointee in 2017, the Republican Senator of Louisiana embarrassed multiple federal judge nominees with questions about basic law during their confirmation process in 2023, but not impacting their appointment.\nFor foreign policy and defense, Biden disproportionally appointed executives from <italic>Albright Stonebridge</italic> and <italic>WestExec Advisors</italic>. While key figures from the former include UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Deputy Secretary of State nominee Wendy Sherman, and Philip Gordon, Deputy National Security Adviser to VP Kamala Harris, notable officials from the latter were Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines, and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki. While Biden considered naming <italic>WestExec </italic>co-founder Mich\u00e8le Flournoy as Secretary of Defense, he instead chose the Black General Lloyd Austin,<italic> </italic>a former <italic>Raytheon</italic> board member and partner of <italic>Pine Island Capital Partners</italic>. <italic>Teneo</italic> invested in <italic>WestExec</italic> shortly after. Over the next four years, Defense Secretary Austin\u2019s emphasis on DEI alienated veterans, causing their endorsement of military service to plummet from 88 to 53%, and drag recruitment into one of the worst slumps in the half-century of voluntary service.\nFrom a pool of 4,000 political appointees, the Biden Administration notably selected a significant contingent from a singular think tank. The Soros-seeded <italic>Center for American Progress</italic> (\u201cCAP\u201d), employing a staff of 300, saw nearly seventy staff appointed, including cabinet positions, advisory roles, and chiefs of staff. Notable among them is Neera Tanden, former President of CAP, who became a senior advisor. \nBorn to likely-Brahmin Hindu immigrants, Tanden was nominated to be the first Southeast Asian to lead OMB but withdrew after comparing Republican moderates to criminals and conservatives to fictional villains on social media. She was succeeded at CAP by Patrick Gaspard, previously led Soros\u2019 <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic>. Additionally, Brian Deese, who headed Biden\u2019s <italic>National Economic Council</italic>, had prior experience as a CAP senior analyst. Carmel Martin, serving as Deputy Director of the White House Economic Mobility Domestic Policy Council, held positions at CAP as EVP and Distinguished Fellow. \nWhile large foundations typically raised funds from corporations and foreign governments, CAP relied on other foundations. Most were tech focused. <italic>Microsoft</italic>\u2019s <italic>Gates Foundation</italic>, <italic>Facebook</italic>\u2019s <italic>Zuckerberg Foundation</italic>, <italic>William & Flora Hewlett Foundation</italic>, <italic>Silicon Valley Community Foundation</italic>, and <italic>Heising-Simons Foundation </italic>(affiliated with <italic>Renaissance Technology</italic>) were among CAP\u2019s 13 largest doners, with over a $1 million each. <italic>Ford</italic> <italic>Foundation</italic> and <italic>David & Lucile Packard Foundation</italic> were among 9 donors giving over $500,000. High caste Jews were also overrepresented, including Andrew Hauptman (a Bronfman-Gunzburg in-law) and the Levite<italic> Lavine</italic>, <italic>Sandler</italic>, and <italic>Siegel</italic> foundations (the first two were founders of <italic>Bain Capital</italic> and <italic>Golden West</italic> S&L). \nLikewise, Soros\u2019 son Alex frequently visited the White House and other political functions. And as George Soros retired, he shifted the family office and <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic> to Alex. By 2023, he began dating Hillary Clinton\u2019s former campaign Vice Chair and<italic> Clinton Foundation </italic>executive, Huma Abedin, a Muslim, and became engaged within a year. Also in 2023, <italic>Open Society </italic>froze new donations and planned a minimum 40% staff reduction, engaging <italic>Deloitte</italic> to assist with the redesign into a more politically charged, \u2018strategic opportunistic\u2019 model while committing funds to increase female and youth civic engagement.\nThe government\u2019s relationship with large foundations mirrored that with banks. To direct government relations from 2020, <italic>Gates Foundation</italic> hired Miguel Rodriguez, CAP\u2019s former SVP for Government Affairs from 2017. Rodriguez became Obama\u2019s Director of Legislative Affairs in 2013, after serving as Hillary Clinton\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Senate Affairs when she was Secretary of State and Chief Counsel when she was a Senator. \nTo head global programs from 2018, <italic>Ford Foundation </italic>named Hilary Pennington, a former <italic>Gates Foundation </italic>director (2006-12), CAP Senior Fellow (2006-8), and Co-Chair of President Clinton\u2019s Technology Advisory Committee in 2000. And Ricardo Castro became VP, General Counsel & Secretary at <italic>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</italic> in 2022 after five years as SVP and General Counsel at <italic>International Rescue Committee</italic>, a year as <italic>General Counsel</italic> at <italic>Clinton Foundation</italic> and VP, Secretary & General Counsel at <italic>Ford Foundation</italic>, and 16 years as General Counsel & Secretary at <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic>.\nThe situation was not much different in the Ivy Leagues, of which only a few were led by women. Back in 2004, Amy Gutmann became <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic>\u2019s 8th President, but the first first-generation and low-income. When she resigned in 2022 to join the Biden Administration, Gutmann was <italic>Penn</italic>\u2019s longest-serving president. Succeeding Gutmann, North Dakota-born Elizabeth Magill came from a family of lawyers. She assisted Senator Conrad after graduating <italic>Yale</italic>, and following <italic>Uni of Virginia</italic> Law, clerked for Court Justice Ginsburg and became <italic>Stanford</italic> Law Dean. \nAfter the resignation of <italic>Harvard</italic>\u2019s President in 2022, Senior Fellow and Obama\u2019s former Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker appointed Claudine Gay as its first Black and second female President in <italic>Harvard</italic>\u2019s shortest presidential search in almost 70 years. Like her cousin, Claudine Gay attended <italic>Phillips Exeter</italic> before studying economics at <italic>Stanford</italic>, and receiving a <italic>Harvard</italic> doctorate in African & African American studies. \nAs a Professor of Government and African & African American Studies, she focused on minority political participation. Despite publishing only eleven insignificant journal articles, Gay was backed by former President Obama. Indeed, Gay used her power to silence Black conservatives. While terminating <italic>Harvard</italic>\u2019s first Black dean, Ronald Sullivan, in 2019 for representing alleged rapist Harvey Weinstein, Gay terminated Professor Roland Fryer\u2014who published dozens of significant articles\u2014for allegedly creating a hostile work environment.\nGay did not discuss her to Haiti\u2019s economic and political elite. Her father, Sony, immigrated to America and became a member of America\u2019s <italic>Army Corps of Engineers</italic> based in Saudi Arabia while his brother Michael worked at construction giant <italic>Kiewit</italic>. Much of the brothers\u2019 family remained in Haiti, including their uncle Cavour Delatour, an engineer and architect who worked on the <italic>National Palace</italic>, his <italic>Uni of Chicago</italic>-trained son Leslie worked at <italic>BANK</italic>. Cavour\u2019s cousin Soeurette Delatour married Matar Ligond\u00e9, their daughter Aurore married Ernest Bennett, a mulatto businessman who descended from Haiti\u2019s first Black king, King Henri Christophe. \nSince becoming President of Haiti in 1957, Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier grew into a dictator, and replaced the White French-born Archbishop with Matar\u2019s brother Francois-Wolff Ligond\u00e9 in 1966, who became Haiti\u2019s first Black Archbishop. After Fran\u00e7ois died in 1971, his twenty-year-old son Jean-Claude assumed the presidency, marrying Mich\u00e9le, the daughter of Aurore and Ernest Bennett, in 1980. The President allowed his new father-in-law Ernest Bennett to dominate coffee exports with duty exemptions. \nWhen General Henri Namphy overthrew Duvalier in 1986, Leslie married Namphy\u2019s niece, and served as Haiti\u2019s finance minister in the 1980s and led <italic>Central Bank of Haiti</italic> in the early 1990s. Before Leslie died in 2001, his brother Patrick joined Sony and Michael to form Haiti\u2019s first and only ready-made concrete supplier, CDG, in 2000. While Patrick left to become President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val\u2019s minister of tourism in 2006, Leslie\u2019s widow married Pr\u00e9val in 2009. Although the earthquake of 2010 claimed many Delatour and Bennett lives, CDG thrived due to foreign aid. \nOn the heel of Trump\u2019s <italic>CARES</italic> in 2020, President Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion relief plan surpassed immediate needs on the level of WWII mobilization. Whereas the 2009 stimulus covered 50% of the output shortfall, the early 2021 stimulus covered 300% the shortfall. In March 2021, Democrats extended the <italic>Employee Retention Tax Credit</italic> (\u201cERC\u201d) to wages paid through the end of that year and enabled small businesses that started during the pandemic to claim it. ERC evolved into a de facto employee retention subsidy, primarily benefiting Democrat states with stringent lockdowns like California and New York. Despite ERC and other relief measures, these states continued to have higher-than-average unemployment rates. \nAfter signing an inflationary and economically nationalist <italic>Infrastructure Investment & Jobs Act</italic> to spur American manufacturing in late 2021 valued at $1 trillion, Biden signed the <italic>Inflation Reduction Act</italic> by late 2022 (\u201cTA2022\u201d). Passing only with Democratic votes, Biden conceded the latter was a misleadingly named energy reform compromise. Costing $1.2 trillion and expected to trigger $3 trillion in private investment to meet the <italic>Paris Accords</italic> and appeal to Chakrabarti-like <italic>Green New Dealers</italic>, activists remained concerned about its health implications due to new federal oil lands in mostly non-White areas.\nBiden soon appointed CAP co-founder John Podesta to oversee grant disbursement. Amidst dozens of thousands of grantees, EPA and DOE voiced concern over the funding surge lacking oversight. The large range of new and expanded programs raising mismanagement concerns included clean drinking water initiatives, electric school bus investments, and the creation of a new Office of Environmental Justice & External Civil Rights, with an expanded budget from $12 million to $3 billion. \nOver 80% of the renewables investments went to sparsely populated counties with below-average wages and college graduation rates. While the Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer\u2019s son-in-law Michael Shapiro served as President Biden\u2019s deputy assistant secretary for economic policy at the Department<italic> </italic>of Transportation, he left to become <italic>Blackstone</italic>\u2019s Managing Director of Government Affairs with a focus on infrastructure investment from 2022.\nAfter reducing interest rates post-<italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, FRS and ECB modified their framework for assessing inflation following deep recessions. Before the change, policymakers raised rates when the prices grew above 2%. The new framework only increased rates after the price level returned to the pre-crisis trend. This approach gave businesses more confidence to invest in the economy. The first application of this framework occurred during COVID. With the subsequent economic recovery increasing energy demand, low investment unleashed energy inflation in America and Germany to multi-decade highs without adding monetary policy breathing room and significant UST and MBS assets on their balance sheets. \nAs COVID-era moratoria prevented PUs shutoffs over unpaid debts and squeezed PU investment. Moreover, drought grew. After PG&E came out of her 2001 bankruptcy in 2004, they filed for bankruptcy again in 2019 as blame for California\u2019s deadliest fire fell on her faulty equipment. When local officials and engineers caused floods by releasing water in 2021, China punished them and limited new flows. But as energy prices soared during the <italic>Panic of 2022</italic>, so did temperatures, spreading drought and hoarding. Some cities chose between limiting nuclear power and overheating, others between hydro-electricity storage and water release. \nMeanwhile, banks diversified. Since FA2010 prohibited proprietary trading, Lloyd Blankfein and Gary Cohn steered <italic>Goldman</italic> into fintech-based retail. By 2015, they hired <italic>Discover</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> <italic>Head of Payments</italic> Harit Talwar, who earlier served as managing director of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> <italic>Consumer Banking Group International</italic> following fifteen years with <italic>Citi</italic>. After Talwar launched <italic>Marcus</italic> in 2016. With the appointment of David Solomon as CEO in 2017, <italic>Goldman</italic> boosted <italic>Marcus</italic> in 2018 with the purchase of <italic>Clarity Money, </italic>founded by the brother of computer magnate Michael Dell, making him Head of Product at <italic>Marcus</italic>. Within a year, <italic>Goldman</italic> grew <italic>Marcus</italic> by forming partnerships with <italic>Apple</italic>. Instead of <italic>Visa</italic> or <italic>American Express</italic>, the <italic>Goldman Marcus</italic>-<italic>Apple</italic> card relied on another partner, <italic>MasterCard</italic>.\nNot wanting to wait for Vikram Pandit to retire from <italic>Citi </italic>in 2012, the son of a Sikh lieutenant general, Ajay Banga left to lead <italic>MasterCard</italic> in 2010. Following his brother, Manvinder left <italic>Unilever</italic> to join <italic>Clayton Dubilier Rice</italic> LBO. By 2018, <italic>Facebook</italic>\u2019s <italic>Instagram</italic> hired Ajay\u2019s daughter as Media Product Strategist. While <italic>MasterCard</italic> and <italic>Visa</italic> backed <italic>Facebook</italic>\u2019s <italic>Libra</italic> crypto project in 2020, regulatory and public pressure folded <italic>Libra </italic>by 2019. As <italic>MasterCard</italic> brought crypto on to their network in early 2021, <italic>Facebook</italic>\u2019s<italic> Instagram</italic> promoted Aditi Banga from Head of <italic>Shopping Partnerships</italic> to <italic>Creator Monetization & Innovation Partnerships</italic>. Leaving <italic>MasterCard</italic>, Ajay became an advisor to <italic>General Atlantic</italic>\u2019s climate fund and served on the boards of <italic>American Red Cross</italic>, <italic>Kraft Foods</italic>, and <italic>Dow</italic>. \nLike with fintechs, talent and capital fled banks to less regulated entities. In 2013, <italic>Deutsche</italic> real estate private equity executives Justin Kennedy and Tobin Cobb left to form a private real estate investment trust and development corporation. Even hedge funds and private equity faced competition from family offices. Among the largest offices were Michael Dell\u2019s MSD <italic>Capital</italic>, Bill Gates\u2019 <italic>Cascade Investment, </italic>and <italic>Bloomberg</italic>-founder and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s <italic>Willett Advisors</italic>. MSD <italic>Capital</italic>\u2019s successful ventures include the acquisition of <italic>IndyMac Bank</italic> during the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>. Once seen as a successor to <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s Gorman, Greg Fleming left in 2017 to form <italic>Rockefeller</italic> multi-family office. \nBy 2021, more women led family offices than corporations or other investment vehicles. Sergey Brin hired Marie Young as CIO in January 2022. Melinda Lewison managed Jeff Bezos\u2019 office. Suzi Kwon Cohen oversaw investments for <italic>Chanel</italic> heirs. Hedge fund investor Dan Och chose Mira Muhtadie. Wendy Craft manages the family office of real estate heir Kent Swig. Women also managed family offices for Oprah Winfrey as well as the Hershey and Heinz families. In 2023,<italic> Lazard</italic> formed <italic>Lazard</italic> Family Office Partners by buying the female-owned <italic>Truvvo</italic>. Within months, the daughter of Reginald Lewis, the first Black to take over a billion <italic>dollar</italic> corporation, formed <italic>Beatrice</italic>, the first multi-family office led by a Black woman.\nAs Jamie Dimon planned retirement, he continued grooming possibly successors. Back in 2009, <italic>Lazard</italic> Chicago\u2019s Mary Callahan rose from Head of <italic>Morgan </italic>Private Bank replaced him, becoming head of Asset & Wealth Management and joining the Operating Committee. By 2013, <italic>Morgan </italic>promoted British-born Marianne Lake to CFO. The daughter of an IBM programmer and an airline ticketing agent, Lake studied physics at <italic>Uni of Reading</italic> and worked as a chartered accountant at <italic>Pricewaterhouse Cooper</italic> before joining <italic>Morgan </italic>in 1999. She served as Global Controller of the Investment Bank from 2007 to 2009 and CFO of Consumer & Community Banking from 2009 to 2012, dealing with the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic> and trading scandals. Unmarried, she had three children via surrogate. \nAnother powerful <italic>Morgan </italic>woman was Jennifer O\u2019Connor Piepszak. Joining <italic>Morgan </italic>in 1994 after graduating <italic>Fairfield Uni</italic>, Piepszak served as CEO of the card services and business banking units, CFO of the mortgage banking arm, and Controller of Mortgage Banking & Retail Financial Services. By 2019, <italic>Morgan </italic>named Piepszak as CFO, replacing Lake, who became CEO of Consumer Lending, Payments, Lending, and Commerce, including Card Services, Home Lending and Auto Finance. Along with naming a White man as CFO in 2021, <italic>Morgan </italic>made Lake and Piepszak co-CEOs of community and consumer banking. \nLikewise, <italic>Morgan </italic>bought <italic>Frank</italic>, a college financial planning company, for $175 million and made the 28-year-old founder, Charlie Javice, a Managing Director and Head of Student Solutions. Her father, Didier, grew up and studied in Paris before joining <italic>Goldman</italic> in risk management from 1986 to 1997. Afterward, he managed several systematic hedge funds, including <italic>Dynamic Capital Management</italic>, <italic>Risk Management Advisors</italic>, <italic>W Fund Advisors</italic>, and <italic>1859 Capital</italic>.\nSince long-time <italic>Morgan </italic>banker James Staley became CEO of <italic>Barclay</italic>, he brought several bankers from <italic>Morgan </italic>in 2016, including Brahmin Coimbatore Sundararajan Venkatakrishnan (\u201cVenkat\u201d), a risk officer who was with <italic>Morgan </italic>since 1994. By 2020, Venkat transitioned from Chief Risk Officer to Head of Global Markets. And as Staley stepped down amid an investigation into his ties to sex-trafficking financier Jeffrey Epstein in 2021, Venkat became CEO of <italic>Barclay</italic>. After revelations that he paid Epstein for tax and estate planning services, Leon Black resigned from <italic>Apollo</italic> in 2021. He continued to fight multiple sexual assault allegations, which were later dismissed.\nAlso in 2021, Jane Fraser became the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank as CEO of <italic>Citi</italic>. With a Scottish aristocrat heritage, Fraser spent a short stint at <italic>Goldman</italic> before rising to Partner at <italic>McKinsey</italic> and 16 years to <italic>Citi</italic>. The same year, <italic>Royal Bank of Canada </italic>promoted SVP Nadine Ahn to CFO, skipping the EVP level, making her the only woman in that role at Canada\u2019s six largest banks.\nUnlike UBS, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> did not require a bailout after the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>. After Swiss lawyer Urs Rohner became General Counsel of Banking in 2004, he rose to Banking COO and Vice Chair by 2009. In 2011, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> named Swiss lawyer Urs Rohner as Chair, having impressed management by delaying investigation payouts to boost profits. While fellow board directors included a <italic>Harvard</italic> professor studying workplace gender equality and a <italic>Google </italic>inventor, Rohner\u2019s Vice Chair was the CEO of drugmaker <italic>Roche</italic>. Other similarly qualified highly paid directors included Qatari royal and the son of a former <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> Chair. By 2013, Rohner and his CEO, Brady Dougan, hired Iqbal Khan as CFO Private Banking & Wealth Management. Born to a Swiss mother and likely a cousin of Pakistan\u2019s political Khan dynasty, Khan moved from Karachi to Switzerland in 1982, where he held various positions at <italic>Ernst Young</italic> and became the Managing Partner of Assurance & Advisory Services for Financial Services in 2011.\nUnder Rohner,<italic> Credit Suisse</italic> became a proponent of gender diversity, striving to elevate women to key positions within the bank. While surveys concluded that better female representation leads to higher share price valuation, female executives continued departing. Along with a project to re-engage women, Dougan formed a \u2018super-department\u2019 including communication, marketing, talent development, branding, and personnel, hiring Pamela Thomas, <italic>McKinsey</italic>\u2019s first Black female partner and former CEO of CNBC and <italic>Liz Claiborne</italic>. Although Thomas did not move from New York for Switzerland, Dougan appointed her Chair of <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> New Markets to build the bank\u2019s market share with women, Blacks, and LGBT by 2014.\nIn 2015, Rohner replaced Dougan with Tidjane Thiam, a nonbanker from <italic>Prudential</italic>, leading Thomas to resign after losing her overarching role and Executive Board seat. As Thiam bolstered domestic operations to create a new \u2018Swiss Universal Bank\u2019, escalating competition led UBS to hire Martin Blessing, a fellow <italic>McKinsey </italic>alum who formed CEO<italic> Commerzbank Dresdner</italic>, to lead its Swiss operations (while his wife Dorothee served as <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Vice Chair of international investment banking and investment banking head in Israel, German-speaking, and Nordic countries.) By 2018, UBS consolidated global wealth management under Blessing. \nTo execute his vision, Thiam continued Dougan\u2019s project with Rohner\u2019s support. As both believed that competent people could succeed without experience, they promoted investment banker Lara Warner Chief Compliance and Regulatory Affairs Officer with a seat on the Executive Board. By 2019, she became Chief Risk Officer, reporting directly to Thiam, alongside Lydie Hudson, whom he promoted from COO of Global Markets to Chief Compliance Officer with an Executive Board seat. Warner soon sidelined risk expertise to promote front office sales by removing senior risk managers, changing reporting structures, and impeding the implementation of risk tools.\nAlso in 2015, UST\u2019s clampdown on tax evasion led Thiam to shift from volatile trading to stable wealth management. With a strategy of issue stock to buy Swiss banks and expand to Russia, the Middle East, Brazil, and Mexico, Thiam promoted Khan to CEO of <italic>International Wealth Management</italic> with an Executive Board seat. Continuing to rely on his <italic>McKinsey</italic> colleagues, Thiam appointed Pierre-Olivier Bou\u00e9e his COO. Bou\u00e9e tried to implement cost controls. When Bou\u00e9e disallowed Rohner\u2019s friend and former board member from using employee parking per the rules, Rohner told him to think about the request carefully. And against Bou\u00e9e\u2019s objection of extravagance, Rohner flew the bank\u2019s supervisory and executive boards and spouses to New York to celebrate the bank\u2019s restructuring.\nWhile Thiam\u2019s son underwent cancer treatment, he planted trees between his house and that of his new neighbor, Khan. As his relationship with Thiam worsened, Khan resigned in 2019 to replace Martin Blessing at UBS. Scandal erupted as Khan publicly confronted a private investigator who was trailing him. While attributing the surveillance for poaching to Bou\u00e9e, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> cleared Thiam. The scandal, which led to the suicide of the investigator, triggered a criminal investigation. Although investors called for Rohner to back Thiam or resign, Rohner and the board asked Thiam to resign by 2020. While cancer took Thiam\u2019s son in 2020, it also threatened <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s Venkat from 2021. \nFollowing Thiam, Thomas Gottstein assumed leadership and sought to streamline technology and operational costs by promoting Lara Warner to Chief Risk & Compliance Officer. Despite red flags placement on a \u2018watchlist\u2019 by internal risk managers as <italic>Greensill</italic><italic> Capital</italic> lost insurance from <italic>Tokio Marine</italic> and was investigated by German banking regulators in July 2020, Warner overruled objections, and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> proceeded with a $160 million bridge loan in October. Warner was also unaware of <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s prime brokerage client as compliance shrugged off wire fraud with DOJ in 2012, a Hong Kong trading ban in 2014, and negative news in 2015 as isolated events. By March 2021, <italic>Greensill</italic> collapsed as inquiries into fraudulent activities associated with guaranteed COVID loans to Sanjeev Gupta accelerated.\nAfter write-down $450 million linked to hedge fund <italic>York Capital </italic>losses in late 2020<italic>,</italic> <italic>Credit Suisse </italic>faced debt defaults from <italic>Greensill </italic>for $3 billion and <italic>Archegos</italic> for $4.7 billion by April 2021. Along with lawsuits from pensions that had invested in these funds, Mozambique taxpayers sued <italic>Credit Suisse </italic>in the corrupt \u2018tuna bond\u2019 scandal. As Gottstein removed Warner and began eliminating the investment bank, CSFB, <italic>Paul Weiss</italic>\u2019 investigation into<italic> Archegos</italic> blamed poor risk management. Rohner remained Chair until his term ended, when former <italic>Lloyd</italic> Bank Chair Antonio Horta-Osorio took over. However, Horta-Osorio stepped down by early 2022 for breaking COVID regulations. By July Gottstein resigned, followed by the Chief Compliance Officer. While <italic>Saudi National Bank</italic>, <italic>Qatar Investment Authority</italic>, and Saudi<italic> Olayan </italic>injected capital in December.\nAfter <italic>Goldman</italic> expanded <italic>Marcus</italic> partnerships to include <italic>General </italic><italic>Motor</italic> and acquired buy-now-pay-latter home improvement lender <italic>GreenSky</italic> in late 2021, Stephanie Cohen transitioned from Head of the <italic>Consumer & Wealth Management </italic>division to lead the newly formed <italic>Platform Solutions</italic> division, as part of a corporate reshuffle in 2022, consolidating credit card partnerships, transaction banking, and <italic>GreenSky</italic>, and the only woman to lead one of the firm\u2019s three revenue divisions. As <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s <italic>Marcus</italic> Chair Harit Talwar resigned, and his deputy Omer Ismail left to run <italic>Walmart</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> FinTech. While Talwar joined <italic>MasterCard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> board in 2022, <italic>Marcus</italic> faced large losses and a CFPB probe. \nFintech helped <italic>Silicon Valley Bank</italic> (\u201cSVB\u201d) cross FA2010\u2019s $100 billion threshold. Having started in 1981 to lend to upstart high-tech firms ranging from medical products to telecoms. In 2019, FRS <italic>San Francisco</italic> elected SVB\u2019s CEO as director. He represented the third and largest bank, the others being <italic>Pioneer Trust Bank</italic> and <italic>Pacific Premier Bank</italic>. The rest of directors included a food processing executive, the former Chair of <italic>Warner</italic>, Chief Negotiator of the world\u2019s largest entertainment labor union, and retired president of UPS <italic>North California</italic>. (<italic>Seacoast Commerce Bank</italic> replaced <italic>Pacific Premier Bank </italic>in 2020.)\nIn 2020, SVB hired <italic>McKinsey </italic>to deal with FA2010. As <italic>McKinsey</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> failed to increase value, SVB hired consultancy <italic>Curinos</italic> to study the impact of interest rate changes on deposits. Having a satisfactory answer, SVB assumed that interest rates would remain low and sold interest rate hedges on their UST bonds. Along with <italic>Signature Bank</italic>, SVB targeted corporate clients, and so most deposits were over the FDIC insured limit. (While custodial trust banks had similar levels, they invested less in UST bonds for liquidity.) While this governance (or the \u2018G\u2019 of ESG) was ostensibly straightforward to diagnose, FRS <italic>San Francisco</italic> may have eased supervision as she touted \u2018E\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 risks. With $18 million donated to charities and $11.2 billion committed to socially responsible affordable housing projects, SVB made over $5 billion in sustainable finance loans while working with 1,550 sustainability startups.\nIn Britain, mirroring <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Chuka Umunna, Kwasi Kwarteng was born in London to Ghanaian parents, who had immigrated as students in the 1960s, later becoming a barrister and Commonwealth Secretariat economist. After Kwarteng earned scholarships to <italic>Eton</italic>, <italic>Harvard</italic>, and <italic>Cambridge</italic>, he pursued journalism and finance before winning a <italic>Conservative</italic> MP election in 2010. Unlike Umunna, Kwarteng advocated for Brexit, joining the campaign, and eventually becoming Britain\u2019s first Black Chancellor of <italic>Exchequer</italic> under Britain\u2019s third female PM, Liz Truss in 2021. However, as Kwarteng introduced unfunded tax cuts, investors ran from the <italic>pound </italic>and <italic>Exchequer</italic> debt until BOE intervened. Without strong ties, Truss ousted Kwarteng, leading to the departure of her Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, who was born to Indians, adopted Buddhism, and married a Jew. \nAs Truss resigned, Hindu Rishi Sunak took over as the first non-White PM with Suella Braverman as his Home Secretary. British-born Rishi Sunak graduated <italic>Oxford</italic> in 2001 and joined <italic>Goldman</italic> as an analyst. A merchant banking executive director by 2004, Sunak left for <italic>Stanford</italic> MBA and became a partner at <italic>Children</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Investment Fund Management</italic> in 2006. After marrying the daughter of <italic>Infosys</italic> founder Narayana Murthy in 2009, Sunak founded <italic>Catamaran Ventures</italic> in 2009 and entered politics.\nIn early 2023, King Charles III appointed Alison Rose, CEO of <italic>NatWest</italic>\u2014Britain\u2019s largest bank, of which <italic>Exchequer</italic> owned 38.6%, with subsidiaries including RBS and <italic>Coutt</italic><italic>s</italic>\u2014as a Dame of the British Empire, and she joined PM Rishi Sunak\u2019s business council. In June, however, Brexit champion Nigel Farage claimed his <italic>Coutt</italic><italic>s</italic> accounts were closed due to his political views. Within a month, Rose disclosed to BBC that Farage\u2019s accounts were closed in part because he fell below <italic>Coutt</italic><italic>s</italic>\u2019 \u00a33 million wealth threshold, which breached client confidentiality. Amidst intense criticism, Rose acknowledged an error of judgment and resigned, followed by the CEO of <italic>Coutts</italic>. \nWhile British private equity shop <italic>Charterhouse</italic> hired Rose by June 2024, British voters  ousted Sunak\u2019s party in a record landslide to Keir Starmer, who appointed a record 11 women to his team of 25, including the deputy PM and the first female <italic>Exchequer</italic> Chancellor, Rachel Reeves. Replacing Sunak, Kemi Badenoch became the first Black leader of the conservative opposition. Her cousin once removed was Oluyemi Osinbajo, Nigeria\u2019s VP from 2015 to 2023, who married to a granddaughter of Chief Obafemi Awolowo, who descended from a line of Yoruba chiefs and influenced Nigeria\u2019s federal structure through the 1954 constitution.\nAlso in 2024, <italic>Royal Bank of Canada </italic>dismissed CFO Nadine Ahn, the most senior woman in Canadian banking, for not disclosing a personal relationship with colleague Ken Mason, who like her was married. She used her position to advance Mason\u2019s career and concealed the relationship while firing another employee for a similar issue. <italic>Canaccord Genuity Group</italic> quickly hired Ahn for a senior role. \nIn France, Gabriel Attal became France\u2019s youngest PM at 34 and the country\u2019s first openly gay leader in early 2024. Attal became prominent as President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government spokesman during COVID-19, served as a junior minister in the finance ministry before his appointment as Education Minister., Macron appointed Attal. However, following a parliamentary election in July 2024, Attal resigned.\nWhen American House Speaker Pelosi retired in her 80s in late 2022, Brooklyn-born NYU Law graduate, former <italic>Paul Weiss</italic> and CBS lawyer, and early Obama supporter, Hakeem Jeffries became the first Black to lead Congressional Democrats. Despite the <italic>Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012</italic>, Pelosi, dozens of members of Congress, and their families continued to insider trade without repercussion. \nMeanwhile, after a decade of unconventional monetary policy bordering on monetary dominance, central bank scandals erupted across the world. In America, FRS Vice Chair and the presidents of FRS <italic>Boston</italic> and FRS <italic>Dallas</italic> were found to have engaged in securities trading, leading to their resignations by fall 2022. In response, Chair Jerome Powell reformed ethics rules to limit active trading among senior FRS officials. With member changes through March 2023, Biden transformed the all-White 7-member FRS <italic>Board</italic> to include two Blacks\u2014including the new Vice Chair Jefferson\u2014and 4 females for the first time. (While FRS <italic>Dallas</italic>\u2019 Kaplan later returned to <italic>Goldman</italic> as Vice Chair, long-time <italic>Goldman</italic> executive Beth Hammack became President of FRS <italic>Cleveland</italic> in 2024.)\nIn China, Sun Guofeng, formerly head of the central bank\u2019s monetary policy department, was imprisoned for disclosing classified information and taking bribes of $3 million from 2002 to 2020. In Nigeria, investigations into former central bank Governor Godwin Emefiele uncovered unauthorized overseas bank accounts in his name, leading to his suspension and arrest on fraud charges. In Latvia, former central bank Governor Ilm\u0101rs Rim\u0161\u0113vi\u010ds was sentenced to prison after being found guilty of accepting bribes as part of a broader series of financial scandals involving bribery, money laundering, and fraud that have affected Latvia and neighboring Estonia, tied to the movement of suspicious funds out of Russia.\nWith <italic>State Bank of Vietnam</italic> since 1991, LeMinh Hung was appointed the central bank\u2019s Deputy Governor in 2014. By 2020, the National Assembly voted to name Hung the country\u2019s first female central banker. During this time, the Communist Party Secretary-General targeted Vietnam\u2019s top business leaders and officials in his anti-corruption campaign. In 2022, Lan, Chair of <italic>Van Thinh Phat</italic>, was arrested for issuing illegal bonds and using Vietnam\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Saigon Commercial Bank</italic> (\u201cSCB\u201d), fraudulently. \nHer case caused depositors to run from SCB, leading <italic>State Bank of Vietnam</italic> to take control of the bank and assure customers their deposits were safe. Still, credit institutions became more cautious in managing credit. While Lan was sentenced to death, her husband received a nine-year sentence, and her niece was sentenced to 17 years. The 82 convictions included 45 SCB executives, 15 <italic>State Bank of Vietnam</italic> officials (with the chief inspector receiving a life sentence for accepting a bribe), and several officials from the Government Inspectorate and State Audit offices.\nAs FRS hiked rates, centralized <italic>Bitcoin</italic> exchanges, beleaguered <italic>Facebook</italic>, and their VC investors deflated. Despite poor controls, FTX bought out shares from rival <italic>Binance</italic> to continue her (potentially election-swinging) lobbying for regulation to access pension fund assets. Equity-investors chasing women became tangled in fraud. Among the most prominent was Elizabeth Holmes, founder of med-tech <italic>Theranos</italic>, sentenced in 2022 to prison as most tests were found to be made up. By 2023, <italic>Morgan </italic>sued Charlie Javice for inflating <italic>Frank</italic>\u2019s customer numbers ahead of the sale. As <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s contract with Javcice stipulated they would cover legal fees, she hired three law firms, with a total of 77 attorneys. \nSince the Trump Administration ended the Obama Administration\u2019s Operation Choke Point policy of \u201cdebanking\u201d individuals and companies and advanced a rule that would have prevented banks from denying access to broad classes of people, the Biden Administration suspended the rule and resumed the use of regulatory pressure to deny banking services without due process, focusing on the cryptocurrency and fintech sectors and political opponents. Among other methods, FDIC sent \u201cpause letters\u201d to banks involved in crypto trading in March 2022.\nTwo months earlier, the crypto-assets hedge fund <italic>Three Arrows Capital</italic> faced bankruptcy due to its significant exposure to the failed <italic>dollar</italic>-pegged crypto-currency and leveraged positions in various crypto-assets, with a debt of over $3.5 billion to other crypto-assets firms, mainly <italic>Voyager</italic>, <italic>Genesis</italic>, and <italic>BlockFi</italic>. So, FTX\u2019s <italic>Alameda</italic> hedge fund bailed out <italic>Voyager</italic> and <italic>BlockFi</italic>. To fund the investments,<italic> Alameda</italic> secretly borrowed FTX customer funds using FTX\u2019s native crypto currency (\u201cFTT\u201d) as collateral. (<italic>Alameda</italic>\u2019s CEO Caroline Ellison granted herself a bonus for the coup.) \nHowever, as the story became public in November 2022, <italic>Binance</italic> and other investors ran from FTT, forcing FTX to declare bankruptcy, followed by <italic>BlockFi</italic> and <italic>Genesis </italic>in January 2023. Along with the other FTX executives, she blamed her former lover, Sam Bankman-Fried, for masterminding the fraud. Sam\u2019s disgrace spread out to his parents, who soon retired from <italic>Stanford</italic>. One of FTX\u2019s prosecutors was DOJ Assistant Attorney Danielle Sassoon. (While her Katz husband\u2019s lineage is unclear, his mother was one of New York\u2019s largest landlords.) Despite plans for a second trial focused on campaign finance violations, Democratic prosecutors decided against probing into political corruption.\nMoreover, FTX boosted deposits at America\u2019s <italic>Silvergate Bank</italic>. After FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, <italic>Silvergate</italic> witnessed an abrupt $8 billion deposit reduction, constituting 68% of its total deposits, necessitating securities sales and borrowing from FHLB <italic>San Francisco</italic> before voluntary liquidation in March 2023. FTX was so important to <italic>Silvergate Bank</italic> that a close group of CEO Alan Lane\u2019s family, including his son Chris Lane, who was the CTO, and his sons-in-law Tyler Pearson, who was the CRO, and Jason Brenier, the manager of correspondent banking, managed FTX accounts.\nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 2023</italic>, SVB realized a $1.8 billion loss on the sale of $21 billion of UST bonds in March. Still, neither SVB nor <italic>Signature Bank</italic> were prepared to borrow from FRS\u2019 discount window. As Thiel\u2019s <italic>Founders Fund</italic> and other VCs ran from uninsured deposits, SVB became the second-largest American bank collapse before FDIC seized and sold her to <italic>First Citizens Bank & Trust</italic>. With FDIC guaranteeing all SVB\u2019s deposits beyond the $250,000 insurance cap, President Biden framed this as supporting American workers and small businesses while covering large deposits held by <italic>Sequoia Capital</italic> and others. As other medium-sized banks teetered, FDIC seized <italic>Signature Bank</italic>. When <italic>First Republic Bank</italic>\u2019s stock price fell, the bank hired <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>McKinsey</italic> to explore strategic options. Despite initial resistance to the idea of a sale, the bank\u2019s share price continued to decline, and its deposits decreased substantially. \nFRS paused Greenspan-era regulations, temporarily allowing FDR-era policy. As 1938\u2019s historical cost accounting allowed S&Ls to hide losses in the 1980s, SEC guided the <italic>Financial Accounting Standards Board</italic> (\u201cFASB\u201d) to re-introduce mark-to-market for banks in 1993. As FRS interest rate hikes deflated bond prices and led to mark-to-market losses, FRS and UST addressed unhedged interest rate risk by implementing <italic>Bank Term Funding Program</italic>, which allowed the acceptance of UST and agency MBS as collateral at their par value for loans with a term of up to 12 months to provide liquidity and inject capital. \nAs panic spread internationally, <italic>Saudi National Bank</italic> Chair Ammar Khudairy, publicly refused to buy more <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> equity. As investors ran, UBS bought <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> days later in the single largest bank failure in the world, and Khudairy resigned soon after losing most of the investment. By May, FDIC took over <italic>First Republic Bank</italic>\u2014the new second-largest American bank collapse\u2014selling it to <italic>Morgan </italic>to prevent further instability and reassure depositors. Despite the living wills, resolutions, bail-ins, and other compliance and legal frameworks mandated by FA2010 and European laws to ensure that systemically important institutions do not use taxpayer funds on bail-outs, none of the bank failures utilized the new technologies. \nBy September, Senator Elizabeth Warren blasted FRS for bank regulation, rallying against rate hikes to protect specifically Black workers. Moreover, higher interest impaired FRS\u2019 ability to remit profits to UST as interest costs exceeded interest receipts by over $100 billion. As Janet Yellen\u2019s UST did not issue long-term debt when interest rates were low, she had to do so at a greater price to settle dues. Likewise, COVID relief fraud continued to squeeze UST. By 2023, excluding loans written-off for \u2018normal defaults, the government admitted that at least a fifth of <italic>Paycheck Protection Program</italic> (\u201cPPP\u201d) loans were likely fraudulent. \nSome of the most brazen frauds funneled CARES loans to street gangs in Wisconsin buying weapons and money laundering scheme involving Nigeria. To recover some of this waste, DOJ and SBA committed decades of government resources to recover the theft. After lockdowns ended in 2022, numerous employers began retroactively claiming the <italic>Employee Retention Tax Credit</italic> (\u201cERC\u201d), resulting in a surge in claims and placing a burden on IRS. Although estimated to cost $55 billion in 2020, UST paid around $230 billion by 2023. So, IRS began retroactively issuing guidance denying eligibility to employers. As FRS began talking about decreasing rates in late 2023, banks used the <italic>Bank Term Funding Program </italic>for arbitrage profits. \nMeanwhile, ESG scams unwound. At <italic>Facebook</italic>, whose DEI lead pled guilty to embezzling over $4 million of ESG funds for personal gains. (Like with other issues incongruent with their ideological narrative, <italic>New York Times</italic> refused to cover this story.) After <italic>Apple</italic> broke her partnership with <italic>Marcus</italic>, <italic>Goldman</italic> gradually exited retail banking. As <italic>Goldman</italic> sought to sell <italic>GreenSky </italic>in March 2023, Head of the <italic>Platform Solutions</italic> division Stephanie Cohen took a personal leave and resigned shortly after. Management Committee member and Head of Sovereign Clients Dina Habib also resigned, joining merchant bank BDT MSD as Vice Chair. As <italic>Launch with GS</italic> reached their $1 billion investment goal in 2023, <italic>Goldman</italic> sunset the program to focus on the <italic>One Million Black Women</italic> initiative under Asahi Pompey. \nAs state pensions dropped her funds, <italic>BlackRock</italic> failed to retain monetized \u2018diverse\u2019 leaders, and so moved away from politicized ESG, and bought Bayo Ogunlesi\u2019s $100 billion energy and infrastructure fund, who in turn resigned as <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2019s lead independent director in early 2024. Since leading <italic>BlackRock</italic>\u2019s exchange traded and passive investment business, <italic>McKinsey</italic>-alum Salim Ramji left to become CEO of <italic>Vanguard</italic>, <italic>BlackRock</italic>\u2019s main competitor along with <italic>State Street</italic>, in 2024. \nLikewise, ESG\u2019s marketing hypocrisy became transparent as New York sued <italic>Pepsi</italic> for excessive pollution, while Arkansas sued <italic>Alphabet</italic> for deliberately driving depression in children through addictive products. Still, <italic>Pepsi</italic>, <italic>Coca Cola</italic>, <italic>Alphabet</italic>, and <italic>Meta</italic> remained a major part of <italic>BlackRock</italic>\u2019s ESG funds. From <italic>Pepsi</italic>, former <italic>McKinsey</italic> New Delhi Senior Partner Laxman Narasimhan left to head <italic>Starbucks.</italic> By then, Brahmin Hindus already led <italic>Microsoft</italic>, <italic>Alphabet</italic>, IBM, <italic>Adobe</italic>, <italic>Twitter</italic>, <italic>FedEx</italic>, and other American companies as Kamala Harris served as VP. \nMeanwhile, aside from America and China, India benefited most during the <italic>Russia-Ukraine War of 2019</italic> as Russia sold her sanctioned oil in the short-term and technology supply chains shifted investment from China to India long-term. Following claims of stock manipulation in 2022, India\u2019s<italic> Adani</italic> faced challenges, including a stock market selloff and questions about connections with PM Modi in early 2023. American short seller <italic>Hindenburg Research</italic>\u2019s allegations against <italic>Adani</italic>, supported by the nonprofit <italic>Organized Crime & Corruption Reporting Project</italic> with funding from America\u2019s State Department, Britain\u2019s<italic> </italic>Foreign Office<italic>, Ford Foundation</italic>, and <italic>Open Society Foundation</italic>, revealed offshore operations and complex investment structures used to boost market value. Only in May did ESG ratings providers and asset managers began reassessing the coal-heavy and politically linked <italic>Adani</italic>, challenging for the company\u2019s role in India\u2019s renewable energy plans. \nAlthough India\u2019s Court ordered <italic>Securities & Exchange Board </italic>to investigate in 2023, <italic>Adani</italic> stocks partially recovered with investment from Indian-born Rajiv Jain\u2019s American hedge fund. Moreover, Modi\u2019s diplomatic engagements continued to favor <italic>Adani</italic>. After Modi\u2019s June 2023 meeting with Nepal\u2019s PM, the government announced in January 2024 that <italic>Adani</italic> would construct and manage an airport. In October 2023, Modi met Tanzania\u2019s counterpart, and by May 2024, <italic>Adani</italic> secured a deal for Dar es Salaam airport\u2019s container terminal. After a June 2024 meeting with Kenya\u2019s President, <italic>Adani</italic> was awarded a deal for Nairobi airport, which was later restrained by courts. In the same month, following Modi\u2019s meeting with Vietnam\u2019s PM, <italic>Adani</italic> was announced to be investing in Vietnam\u2019s airports.\nBy 2024, <italic>Hindenburg</italic> claimed <italic>Securities & Exchange Board</italic> Chair Madhabi Buch had a conflict of interest as she had invested in an offshore fund connected to <italic>Adani</italic>, a Modi proxy blamed Soros for anti-Indian propaganda. In November, America\u2019s SEC and DOJ indicted Adani for bribery in securing Indian power contracts, causing political turmoil in India, with opposition leader Rahul Nehru \u201cGandhi\u201d accusing the Modi government of shielding Adani and demanding his arrest. Parliament sessions have been disrupted as Congress intensifies calls for accountability, while Modi\u2019s BJP party distanced itself, emphasizing industrial partnerships over defending individuals. \nAs Democrats called for PU treatment of <italic>TECH</italic>\u2014and for payments and \u201ctoo-big-to-fail\u201d banks\u2014 <italic>Andreessen Horowitz</italic> funded blockchain-enabled decentralized internet to shift control from platforms to data owners. Although <italic>TECH</italic> generally grew larger under her watch during COVID, FTC\u2019s Lina Khan prevented <italic>Facebook</italic> mergers even after <italic>Apple</italic> cut off cookies and squeezed <italic>Facebook</italic> in 2022. <italic>Google</italic> did so in phases through 2024. Working with DOJ\u2019s Vanita Gupta through 2023, Khan\u2019s team developed a case against <italic>Google</italic> for paying <italic>Apple</italic> and other companies to set <italic>Google</italic> as the default search engine before a court led by Judge Amit Mehta of Gujarat. While <italic>Microsoft</italic> stood to win the most, this trial became the government\u2019s first modern-era Internet monopoly case since suing <italic>Microsoft</italic> in 1998. \nBy then Susan Wojcicki resigned from <italic>Google</italic>\u2019s <italic>YouTube</italic>, and <italic>Stanford</italic>-educated Indian Brahmin Neal Mohan took over under Sundar Pichai. After expanding AA1914 enforcement against interlocking directorates by private equity firms in 2022, DOJ drafted merger guidelines to target deals involving technology platforms, private-equity practices, and harm to workers in 2023. While KKR continued to thrive through infrastructure deals, <italic>Carlyle</italic> shuttered her consumer, media, and retail private equity investment team.\nAlso in 2023, Sikh Ajay Banga was elected the first Asian President of <italic>BANK</italic>, and <italic>Facebook</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Instagram</italic> changed Aditi Banga\u2019s title from head of <italic>Creator Monetization & Innovation Partnerships </italic>to <italic>Fashion x Innovation.</italic> As <italic>American Bar Association</italic> passed a resolution supporting laws against caste discrimination. Seattle became America\u2019s first city to ban caste discrimination in early 2023, but a similar bill in Oregon soon failed. As California dismissed a case against two <italic>Cisco</italic> engineers but continued pursuing the company for caste discrimination. Institutions like <italic>Columbia</italic>, <italic>Harvard</italic>, <italic>Brown</italic>, UC <italic>Davis</italic>, <italic>Apple</italic>, IBM, and <italic>Cisco</italic> have added caste to their anti-discrimination policies. \nCalifornia state Senator Aisha Wahab introduced a bill to ban caste discrimination, which has faced opposition from groups like <italic>Hindu American Foundation</italic>, successfully opposed these measures, arguing they unfairly targeted Hindus. While the Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions, Whites began suing for discrimination in June 2023. Among the first casualties of the ruling was <italic>Small Business Administration</italic>\u2019s program granting government contracts to socially disadvantaged business owners without requiring any evidence beyond their race. Similar programs remained for women. \nAlthough 2.4% of Americans were Jewish\u2014many of whom lived in America for generations\u2014the elite connected with America\u2019s ruling class. While Obama\u2019s stepmother was Jewish, other presidents had Jewish in-laws. Lauren Bush\u2014granddaughter of Bush Sr and niece of Bush Jr.\u2014a son of fashion mogul Ralph Lauren. While Ivanka Trump converted to Judaism before marrying real estate heir Jared Kushner, Chelsea Clinton married hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky. Biden\u2019s son Hunter also has a Jewish connection through his second wife, Melissa Cohen, a South African filmmaker. Despite these shared ties to Judaism, the in-laws\u2014ranging from a hedge fund banker to a real estate heir and a South African environmentalist\u2014have little else in common and the Jewish marriages of Bush and Clinton occurred after their presidencies.\nVP Kamala Harris\u2019 husband Doug Emhoff was America\u2019s first Jewish spouse of any president of VP. Harris herself was a first of several identities, including the first Indian. Constituting 1.5% of Americans by 2024, Indians quickly ascended in American political power. While Indian-American Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy lost in the Republican presidential election to Donald Trump, the latter selected JD Vance\u2014the White husband of Usha Chilukuri\u2014for his running mate after Biden dropped out. \nEven as Trump proposed to lower taxes and Harris committed to increasing them for corporations and the wealthy, Harris\u2019 supporters included the Soros family,<italic> Blackstone</italic>\u2019s Jonathan Gray, Bill Gates, <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Peter Orszag and Ray McGuire, Roger Altman, who led investment banking at <italic>Lehman</italic> before founding <italic>Evercore</italic>; and Robert Rubin, former co-Chair of <italic>Goldman</italic> and UST Secretary. Of the over 90 other corporate executives and heirs backing Harris were the Pritzkers, Waltons, and <italic>Microsoft</italic>\u2019s Reid Hoffman, who urged her to replace Lina Khan at FTC.\u00a0Trump\u2019s wealthy backers included <italic>Paulson</italic>\u2019s John Paulson, <italic>Blackstone</italic>\u2019s Stephen Schwarzman, <italic>Soros</italic> alum Scott Bessent, Elon Musk, and both co-founders of <italic>Andreessen </italic><italic>Horwitz</italic>.\u00a0\nWhile the tide turned against DEI, corporations continued coordinating visible executives. Both <italic>Ernst Young</italic> and <italic>Pricewaterhouse</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Cooper</italic> appointed the Big Four\u2019s first non-White male chairs at the same time in late 2023 to start on the same day in 2024. While <italic>Ernst Young</italic> named CPA Janet Truncale as the first female chair, <italic>Pricewaterhouse</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Cooper</italic> selected Mohamed Kande, an electrical engineer from Ivory Coast who transitioned into consulting, as their first Black chair. <italic>Morgan </italic>also positioned women to succeed Jamie Dimon. Since naming Jennifer Piepszak and Marianne Lake co-heads of <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s retail bank, Piepszak became co-head of the firm\u2019s commercial and investment bank, leaving as the sole CEO. Likewise, Dorothee Blessing became global co-head of investment banking and Anu Aiyengar head of advisory as Mary Callahan remained head of Asset & Wealth Management.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Recent International Panics of Eurasia</italic>\nIn the mid-19th century, Friedrich Raiffeisen developed cooperative banking in Germany to provide credit to Christian farmers and craftsmen and exclude Jews. The Raiffeisen banking movement rapidly expanded beyond local areas, and by the early 1870s, the first regional cooperative credit union was established. Unlike unrestrained (Jewish) capitalism or state-run socialist bank, private regional auditing clearinghouses oversaw the cooperatives. During WWII, Germany nationalized Austrian banks, including <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> cooperatives. After the war, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna and Frankfurt did not reopen, but Vienna-based <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> was able to reprivatize by 1955 and grew nationally. From 1970, <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> expanded into corporate and trade finance, with offices in Hong Kong, New York, Singapore, and London. Herbert Stepic grew <italic>Raiffeisen</italic>\u2019s bank network to trade sugar, cocoa, and non-ferrous metals. \nIn Japan, Nobusuke Kishi served as PM from 1957 to 1960. His son Eisaku Sato, served as PM from 1964 to 1972. As the streak ended, another family prospered. Takeo Fukuda was born in Japan\u2019s Gumma district into a Samurai family. His grandfather co-founded <italic>Tokyo Stock Exchange</italic>, and his wife\u2019s family owned a private gold mine in Japan. In 1929, Takeo joined the Ministry of Finance, where he rose through the ranks to become the Deputy Vice-Minister and lead the banking and budget bureaus after WWII. He left the Civil Service in 1952 to become a Diet member for Gunma. Takeo founded the Liberal League in 1962, launching his political career. He held various positions, including Minister of Finance, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Deputy PM, and eventually became PM in 1976. After serving for two years, he continued to represent Gunma in the Diet until 1990 when his son, Yasuo, succeeded him. Takeo died in 1995.\nHaruko, Takeo\u2019s daughter, studied at <italic>Cambridge Uni</italic>, worked at research institutes, and joined <italic>BANK</italic> in 1971. Returning to Britain, Haruko became a stockbroker. Soon becoming the first foreign woman to join <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> and directing London-based <italic>Capel</italic>, she had no time to have children. In 1984, HSBC acquired <italic>Capel</italic> to strengthen their European presence. Following Britain\u2019s \u2018<italic>Big Bang</italic>\u2019 banking deregulation, Haruko began underwriting and managing new issue business without relying on merchant banks. As HSBC reduced its expansion efforts after the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic>, Haruko left the company and became the Vice Chair of <italic>Nikko Europe</italic>, making her the first Japanese woman to hold a senior position in a Japanese financial institution.\nDespite the Cultural Revolution\u2019s impact on Confucian clans from 1966, clans revived after market reforms in 1978, impeding financial development. Regions with stronger clans exhibited greater trust in relatives, distrust of outsiders, and a preference for informal contracts over modern banking. The Chen family of Guangdong in Chaozhou, for example, continued to pass on wealth through the male lineage. \nBorn in 1916 to a well-off family in Jiangsu, Rong Yiren later assumed control of their prosperous textile and flour milling enterprise in Shanghai, overseeing its expansion to 24 mills. His active support for Marxism earned him CCP\u2019s favor, resulting in appointments as Shanghai\u2019s Vice Mayor in 1957 and Vice Minister of textiles in 1959. While most of their family had fled the country, Rong Yiren and his son Yung Chi-kin managed to retain some of their wealth during the subsequent decade. Amid the upheaval of the <italic>Cultural Revolution</italic> from 1966 to 1976, Rong was a labeled capitalist, stripped of his property, and employed as a janitor while his son Yung was sent to collective farms for reeducation. Only intervention by Premier Zhou Enlai spared Rong from imprisonment. Only after Deng Xiaoping\u2019s rise to power in 1972 were Rong and Yung were rehabilitated, and their personal property was restored. Capitalizing on this newfound stability following Mao\u2019s death in 1976, Deng\u2019s economic reform policy led to the establishment of <italic>China International Trust & Investment Corp </italic>(\u201cCITIC\u201d) in 1979. Deng chose Rong to lead CITIC, which became China\u2019s primary vehicle for domestic and foreign investments, driving the nation\u2019s industrialization.\nFollowing reforms in 1984, pre-revolutionary elites often fared better than even CCP members as connections helped them access credit and build commerce. Baohang Yan had favored Northeastern regional autonomy, but after the 1931 occupation, he endorsed Nanjing\u2019s centralized nationalism. Although Yan became Vice Minister after WWII, he failed to gain Northeast autonomy postwar. As a founding member of the <italic>People</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s </italic><italic>Consultative Conference</italic> in 1949 and close associate of Zhou Enlai, Baohang\u2019s son Mingfu interpreted Russian for Mao Zedong and other dignitaries, his son-in-law was a minister in Shanghai and directed an industrial electric group that supplied five provinces. Amidst the <italic>Cultural Revolution</italic>, CCP briefly arrested Baohang and Mingfu on Soviet espionage charges in 1967. While Baohang died a year later, Mingfu joined CCP in 1982. In 1987, CITIC launched CITIC Hong Kong as talks finalized plans for Hong Kong\u2019s return to Chinese control. Rong Yiren\u2019s <italic>Stanford</italic> educated son Yung led the company invested in <italic>Cathay Airlines</italic> and <italic>HK Telecoms</italic>. By 1991, CITIC bought one of Kong Kong\u2019s four hongs, <italic>Hang Chong</italic>, with interests in food, shipping, and car dealerships.\nA \u2018princeling\u2019 central banker, Zhou Xiaochuan, the son of Jiannan, a Minister in China\u2019s State Council during the 1980s, earned a doctorate in economic system engineering from <italic>Tsinghua Uni</italic> and began his career as an assistant to the Minister of Foreign Economic Relations & Trade in 1986. While Zhou\u2019s father faced persecution during the <italic>Cultural Revolution</italic>, Zhou had close connections with Zhao Ziyang, who was purged from power for supporting the Tiananmen Square democracy demonstrators in 1989. Allying with Shanghai economic reformers under former Premier Zhu Rongji, he joined <italic>Central</italic><italic> Bank of China</italic> and became a Member of the CCP Committee in 1991. He oversaw the creation of asset-management companies to address the banking system\u2019s bad debt. In 1996, he was promoted to Vice Chair of <italic>Central </italic><italic>Bank of China</italic> and became a Member of the Chinese Monetary Policy Committee. After rising to Chair in 1998, he returned to <italic>Central </italic><italic>Bank of China</italic> two years later as a Member of the Monetary Policy Department and Chair of the State Securities Regulatory Commission.\nSince gaining control of <italic>Hutchison Whampoa</italic> from HSBC in the 1970s, Li Ka-Shing grew the company into China\u2019s largest hong and the world\u2019s largest port holding firm, alongside diverse other interests. In March 1997, Hutchison successfully bid for the rights to operate ports at both ends of the <italic>Panama Canal</italic>. That same month, Li restructured his holdings by spinning out <italic>Cheung Kong Infrastructure </italic>(\u201cCKI\u201d), transferring a 35% stake in electric PU HEC to CKI\u2014reducing <italic>Hutchison</italic>\u2019s stake to 30%\u2014and increasing CKI\u2019s stake in <italic>Hutchison </italic>to nearly 49%. Amid the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, Hutchison\u2019s container throughput share in China grew to 26%, with further growth internationally.\nWhile anti-pollution efforts aided America\u2019s <italic>Panic of 1970</italic>, Soviet pollution shortened lives. As BA1978 and LBOs restructured America, Soviet SOEs required subsidies and repressed inflation. As BSU<italic> </italic>could not write off SOE debt, SCP<italic> </italic>Secretary Gorbachev sought privatizations. Oil deflation of 1986 and Ukraine\u2019s Chernobyl disaster destabilized nuclear exports, triggering reform. Economist Yevgeny Primakov also convinced Gorbachev that exporting Marxism was too expensive.\nAfter defining asset transfers without ownership in 1987, SCP<italic> </italic>made a convertible <italic>ruble</italic> and BSU<italic> </italic>a central bank for private banks in early 1988. However, as oil deflation drained Soviet FX and liquidity, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian coalers struck in 1989. The same year, American, France, and Japan agreed to create the <italic>European Bank for Reconstruction & Development</italic> (\u201cEBRD\u201d), as a sort of mix of EC, <italic>BANK</italic>, and <italic>Lazard</italic>.\nBy August, Victor Gerashchenko became Chair of BSU. However, Boris Yeltsin gained power in Russia by 1990. Declaring sovereignty, he appointed Gregory Matiukhin as Chair of the new <italic>Russian Central Bank</italic> (\u201cRCB\u201d) in competition with BSU. By June, Yeltsin enacted a bankruptcy law triggered by missed payments, adding an un-administrable definition of profitability in December 1990. The same month, Soviet and Russian parliaments passed conflicting central banking laws. As Gerashchenko\u2019s BSU printed larger denomination Soviet <italic>rubles</italic>, he warned that salaries could not be paid in November 1991. \nWhile SCP refused new credits, a national audit uncovered presidential budget abuses. By yearend, the Soviet Union dissolved and Yeltsin became Russia\u2019s first president of Russia. Like the <italic>Treaty of Versailles</italic>, the Soviet Union fragmented into 15 republics, primarily based on traditional ethnic groups, instead of forming a unified entity resembling the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth to counterbalance the dominance of Russia, which continued to control hundreds of ethnic groups across two continents. While RCB won over BSU, she lost access to Uzbek gold and uranium.\nRussia\u2019s earliest financiers descended from aristocrats who had fled Russia during the Marxist Revolution in 1917 to Sea Cliff, Long Island. Peter Derby, who had returned to Russia in 1990, was one of the earliest among them to do so, who shaped Russia\u2019s financial and company laws. Derby was friends with the Jordan brothers. Before fleeing to America during the Russian Revolution, the Jordan family relatives included Tsar Nicholas II\u2019s physician and General Wrangel\u2019s colonel. From 1985, Nicholas Jordan worked at <italic>Manufacturers Hanover</italic>, <italic>Chemical</italic>, and <italic>Chase</italic>, moving to London in 1992. His brother Boris joined <italic>Kidder</italic> for two years after graduation from <italic>New York Uni </italic>1987, when he joined Derby as a VP of <italic>GPA Capital</italic>. From 1992, Boris directed CSFB Moscow\u2019s investment banking and advised Anatoly Chubais\u2019 <italic>Russian Privatization Center</italic> on auctioning state assets.\nWith royal and KGB roots, Russia\u2019s <italic>Energy Minister </italic>Vladimir Lopukhin advocated breaking up Soviet energy into vertical integrated competitors. After Russia hired <italic>Lazard</italic> to raise foreign debt, Yeltsin sought to privatize SOEs into units, and so replaced Lopukhin in May 1992 and named former Soviet Gas Minister Minster Viktor Chernomyrdin as PM. As Yeltsin allowed him to create an integrated gas monopoly, Lopukhin formed <italic>Lazard</italic> Moscow to create <italic>Gazprom </italic>with Chernomyrdin as Chair. \nThe same month, Matiukhin warned of soaring reciprocal debts. As Russia enacted an insolvency law, RCB lost liquidity, and Yeltsin replaced Matiukhin with Gerashchenko in July. In November, Russia passed another insolvency law passed, but remained little used, forcing businesses to arbitrate in courts. Since SCP defined asset transfers without ownership in 1987 to avoid bankruptcy, courts transferred assets across shells without liabilities or investor protection.\nBruce Rappaport, born in British Palestine to Russian Jews, moved to Switzerland in the late 1950s and began shipping. He expanded into ship management and founded <italic>Inter</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Maritime Bank</italic> in Geneva by the early 1970s, focusing on trade finance and shipping, and securing a key contract in the 1970s to transport Indonesian petroleum. By the late 1970s, he owned refineries in Belgium and Antigua, and he acquired a 7.5% stake in <italic>Bank of New York</italic> (\u201cBONY\u201d) in 1982. In 1992, BONY acquired 28% of <italic>Inter-Maritime</italic>.\nMeanwhile, among Russia\u2019s earliest capitalists was Mikhail Fridman of Ukraine, who founded a commodity trading business in 1989\u2014becoming among the largest players in oil, metals, and vodka\u2014before founding <italic>Alfa Bank</italic> in 1991. By 1992, <italic>Alfa</italic> recruited Pyotr Aven, Minister of Foreign Economic Relations, to gain political influence, and soon enter Yeltsin\u2019s circle. While <italic>Alfa</italic> soon also recruited American-raised Katz-descendant Daniel Rapoport, likely related to Bruce Rappaport. \nAlso in 1989, Mikhail Khodorkovsky established <italic>Menatep</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> in Russia and Switzerland, where he partnered with <italic>Riggs </italic>of Washington, DC, which was expanding overseas amidst the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>. By then, Soviet immigrant Natasha Gurfinkel started her career at <italic>Irving Bank</italic>, which was later acquired by BONY in 1988. In 1992, she was promoted to head the bank\u2019s Eastern European division, where she focused on expanding its business in Russia. She developed key relationships with Russian banks, including <italic>Inkombank</italic>, which moved its business to BONY after Konstantin Kagalovsky, a former executive at <italic>Menatep </italic>and Vice Chair of <italic>Yukos</italic>, assured less stringent oversight compared to <italic>Safra</italic>\u2019s <italic>Republic </italic>NB. Soon after, Gurfinkel married Kagalovsky. In 1994, BONY used <italic>Inter-Maritime</italic> to operate in Russia and partnered with <italic>Menatep</italic>.\nSimilarly, Leningrad-born Lyudmila Edwards worked at <italic>Irving Bank</italic>, ending up as an assistant to Galitzine and Kagalovsky. While Edwards married Brad Edwards in 1977 after moving to America, they divorced in 1987, and she began working at BONY in 1988. As she advanced within the Eastern European division by 1992, she married Peter Berlin, a <italic>Moscow Institute of Physics & Technology</italic> graduate, who gained citizenship with the marriage and started a business called <italic>Benex</italic> in America. Reporting to Gurfinkel, Edwards managed Russian accounts in London as her husband moved funds through BONY and <italic>Inter-Maritime</italic>.\nArguably the most successful Jewish banker was Boris Berezovsky. Berezovsky founded <italic>LogoVaz</italic> in 1989 and gained control of <italic>Russian State Television</italic> and Siberin oil company <italic>Sibneft</italic> with oil trader Roman Abramovich. Berezovsky collaborated with Vladimir Gusinsky on media ventures. Gusinsky formed <italic>MOST Bank</italic> in 1989 and soon acquired <italic>Sevodnya</italic> newspaper, <italic>Itogi</italic> magazine, and NTV. Likewise, Berezovsky cooperated with <italic>Runicom</italic>, started<italic> </italic>by <italic>Menatep</italic>\u2019s Khodorkovsky in Geneva in late 1994. While Abramovich was appointed director of <italic>Runicom</italic>\u2019s Moscow office in 1995, Berezovsky became an influential ally of President Yeltsin, serving as Deputy Secretary of the National Security Council in 1996.\nSince the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, the first-wave post-Marxist Russian oligarchs emerged. After the Soviet collapse, barriers lifted, allowing some outsiders to enter the oligarchic elite as the \u2018outsider oligarchs.\u2019 The old Soviet order politicized property rights and discriminated against ethnic outsiders, leading to a significant increase in entrepreneurial Jewish oligarchs after the collapse. \nIn the same year, the Soviet government faced opposition from anti-Marxist forces led by Yeltsin, and many of the privileged Soviet nomenklatura class joined the populists, securing their victory. The majority of these \u2018insider oligarchs\u2019 were Moscow Christians. For instance, Soviet apparatchik Rem Vyakhirev became President of <italic>Gazprom</italic>, and Vagit Alekperov transitioned from <italic>Minister of Fuel & Energy</italic> to CEO of <italic>Lukoil</italic>. One of the few Christian banking oligarchs, Vladimir Potanin used his connections from the <italic>Ministry of Foreign Trade</italic> to create <italic>Oneximbank</italic> in 1993 with funds from <italic>Vneshtorg</italic>. \nWith the Soviet system dissolved, satellites became market economies, imported ECGD-guaranteed American grain. As Central and East Europe relied on <italic>Gazprom</italic>, gas distribution experienced a supply shock as Ukraine and other countries nationalized pipes and had to now pay in hard currency. Likewise, <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> expanded operations from Hungary to Slovakia, Poland, Czechia, Bulgaria, and Croatia by 1993. While Gerashchenko did not pursue disinflation, he warned that the satellites were borrowing RCB funds free of charge without corresponding debits in May 1993. When Russia adopted a new <italic>ruble</italic> weeks later, Gerashchenko convinced Uzbekistan to use a common currency for gold and uranium trade. \nSoviet satellites followed similar paths. Most centrally planned economies had monobank systems, with few having more independent commercial banks. These economies featured specialized state banks alongside the central bank for various sectors. Despite similarities to later-established two-tier systems, these banks operated like divisions within a single bank. While Yugoslavia was first in 1971, Hungary notably introduced a market-oriented two-tier banking system in early 1987. Poland followed suit in January 1989, and Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania did so in January 1990. All these established central banks to manage monetary policy while independent commercial banks engaged in competitive credit activities.\nWhen Hungary split monobank <italic>Hungarian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>in 1987, she yielded her commercial activities to three privileged banks\u2014namely the investment bank <italic>Hungarian</italic> <italic>Creditbank</italic>, trade bank <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, and <italic>Budapest Bank</italic>\u2014while <italic>Hungarian Savings Bank</italic> of 1949 and <italic>Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank</italic> of 1950 were allowed to engage in full banking activities. After Hungary\u2019s rid energy arrears with 1992 bankruptcy reform, she eased the law and bailed out banks. \nWhile Communist regimes were swept away, the same central bankers continued. After the fall of Ceausescu in 1989, Romania experienced significant political and economic instability, characterized by frequent changes in government personnel. In 1990, <italic>Romanian National Bank</italic> was officially established as the country\u2019s central bank. Mugur Is\u0103rescu was appointed governor at that time and remained in the role through the presidencies of Ion Iliescu and Emil Constantinescu. By 2005, Is\u0103rescu had become one of the world\u2019s longest-serving central bankers.\nMeanwhile, Josef To\u0161ovsky, born in 1950 in N\u00e1chod, graduated from <italic>Prague School of Economics</italic> in 1973 and began his career at <italic>Czechoslovakian National Bank</italic>, where he eventually advised the President. He trained in Britain in 1977 and France in 1980, and worked at <italic>Zivnostenska Bank</italic> London in 1984, becoming Deputy Director in 1989. A Communist Party member from 1976 to 1989, To\u0161ovsky was appointed President of <italic>Czechoslovakian National Bank</italic> in 1989, leading its transition to an independent central bank. As Czechoslovakia separated commercial banks from the monobank to be overseen by <italic>Czechoslovakian National Bank</italic>, <italic>Komercni Banka Praha</italic> and <italic>Vseobecna Uverova Banka Bratislava</italic> grew.\nDuring 1991, <italic>National Bank</italic> transferred its long-term assets to <italic>Investicni Banka</italic>, and the savings function was assigned to distinct savings banks. As the government restricted employers\u2019 authority to terminate workers, they delayed implementing a new bankruptcy law passed in 1991 by 18 months. Moreover, additional strategies were introduced to combat unemployment, including targeted credit support for large state enterprises that served as major employers. Privatization increased in 1992 as <italic>Berliner Frankfurter Bank</italic> and IFC bought <italic>Zivnostenska Bank</italic> of 1868, while Slovakia partially privatized state banks with <italic>National Property Fund</italic> retaining minority stakes. By 1993, Czechoslovakia split into Czechia and Slovakia.\nFrom 1993, Josef To\u0161ovs became Governor of <italic>Czech National Bank</italic> and managed the separation of the Czech and Slovak <italic>korunas</italic>. During the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, he clashed with PM V\u00e1clav Klaus over currency stability. In 1997, President V\u00e1clav Havel appointed To\u0161ovsky to form a caretaker cabinet, and he served as PM the first half of 1998. He then returned as Governor of <italic>Czech National Bank</italic> until resigning in 2000 to Chair the Financial Stability Institute at <italic>Bank for International Settlements</italic> in Basel. \nWhen reprivatizing banks, France required big investors to hold for five years when privatizing. As other countries used different methods,<italic> </italic>risks and cross-border mergers grew. After losing her trade monopoly in 1989, Poland\u2019s state-owned <italic>Handlowy</italic> expanded across the country and regained services, driving Poland\u2019s commercial and retail banking markets during the transition to a free-market economy with an 80% share of the corporate market in the early 1990s. Poland mass privatized to all adults and protected indebted employers with insolvency law and <italic>Handlowy </italic>created a joint-venture with <italic>Lazard</italic> in 1995.\nRepublics within the Soviet Union depended on BSU and regional branches of state-run banks. Following, the 1987 Soviet banking system reform and Ukraine\u2019s declaration of independence, <italic>Ukrainian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>(\u201cUNB\u201d) formed as the central bank. By 1992, UNB\u2019s inaugural president Vladimir Matvienko oversaw key reforms, including the reorg of specialized Soviet banks, including <italic>Agroprombank </italic>for agriculture, <italic>Promstrojbank </italic>for industrial lending, <italic>Zhilsotsbank</italic> for social programs, <italic>Sberbank</italic> for savings, and <italic>Vneshekonombank</italic> for foreign trade, into commercial entities\u2014renamed <italic>Ukraina</italic>, <italic>Prominvestbank</italic>, <italic>Ukrsotsbank Oshchadbank</italic>, and <italic>Ukreximbank</italic>\u2014and issuing the non-cash <italic>karbovanetz</italic> to move away from the <italic>ruble</italic>. \nFrom 1994, FRS raised interest rates for the first time since the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>. As UST bond yields grew, Russia\u2019s <italic>ruble</italic> fell 20% against the <italic>dollar</italic> in a day in October, and Yelstin removed Gerashchenko from RCB. By December, Mexico devalued her <italic>peso</italic>. Simultaneously, IMF and BANK financial support contributed economic stability. UNB\u2019s introduction of a liberal commercial licensing procedure led to numerous new banks, with over 230 operating by 1995. Soon after, Viktor Yushchenko became Governor of UNB. Despite nominal autonomy, UNB had limited bank reform power due to government interference. So, UNB loans to the government and politically linked commercial banks grew. \nSimilarly, Belarus established <italic>Belarussian National Bank </italic>in 1990, state-owned and private commercial banks began emerging. While the first banks were established as specialized Soviet banks, privately funded <italic>Belarusbank</italic> served large state enterprises and <italic>Profbank</italic> catered to affiliated trade unions. In 1991, Stanislau Bahdankevich took charge of <italic>Belarussian National Bank </italic>after working with <italic>Soviet State Bank of Belarus</italic> since 1956. In 1994, Belarus President Alyaksandr Lukashenka appointed Mikhail Chyhir, who had directed the BSU <italic>Minsk</italic> and chaired <italic>Belagroprombank</italic>, as PM. \nBahdankevich and Chyhir clashed with Lukashenka over his plan to unify Belarusian and Russian financial systems. Lukashenka dismissed Bahdankevich from <italic>Belarussian National Bank </italic>in 1995, because of his opposition to the unification plan. Instead of opening to foreign investment, Belarus shifted towards supporting large state-owned enterprises, leading to the forced merger of <italic>Belarusbank</italic> and <italic>Sberbank</italic> into the country\u2019s largest bank, ASB <italic>Belarusbank</italic>. This consolidation without enterprise reform further solidified state banking and industry monopolization. Chyhir resigned in November 1996, to protest the extension of Lukashenka\u2019s presidential powers. In 2002, Lukashenka imprisoned Chyhir on corruption charges.\nAlthough Japan remained AIG\u2019s largest market, Asian liberalization spurred multinational entry. Led by Maurice Greenberg\u2019s son Evan, AIG <italic>Asia</italic> received a Chinese license in 1992, the first insurer to do so since the Communist revolution in 1949. Two years later, AIG became the first insurer to return to Pakistan following the government\u2019s nationalization of insurance companies in 1972. By 1995, AIG had reached an agreement with <italic>Tata</italic> in India once these markets were opened to private and foreign investment.\nChinese and Southeast Asian liberalization also monetized the Overseas Chinese cousinhood. In Bangkok from the 1980s, Sino-Thai family businesses diversified ownership and control structures within investment networks blending legal contracts with inter-family marriages. As a Wang-lee of <italic>Nakornthon Bank</italic> married a Lamsam of <italic>Thai Farmers Bank</italic>, two Wang-lee sons wed Lamsam daughters. Pothipong Lamsam\u2019s daughter, Chair of the Board of Trade, married Vachara Panachet, <italic>MMC Sittipol</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> VP. \nThe Srifuengfungs were connected to the Tejaphaibuls. Boonsong Srifuengfung was a director of Tejaphaibul\u2019s <italic>Bangkok Metropolitan Bank</italic>. In 1994, the son of Suchai Virameteekul (<italic>M Thai Group</italic> Chair, involved in chemicals, <italic>Shantou Bank</italic>, and Chinese property), wed the daughter of Dhanin Chearavanont, CEO of <italic>Charoen Pokphand</italic>, which grew a farm seed supplier to dominate Thai\u2019s chicken industry. Suchai and Dhanin have close ties and support the <italic>Thai Chinese Chamber of Commerce</italic>. Chartsiri Sophonpanich from <italic>Bangkok Bank</italic> married a daughter of Nukul Prachaubmoh, former <italic>Bank of Thailand</italic> governor. \nAfter Filipino Vincent Perez started his first job with <italic>Mellon Bank</italic> in 1983, he joined <italic>Lazard</italic> London\u2019s emerging markets practice by 1987 before transferring to New York. As he became <italic>Lazard</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> first Asian partner, his deals included debt-for-nature swap conservation deals for an underground river in Palawan and coral reefs in El Nido. (He resigned by 1996 to start an Asian-focused LBO.) The Philippine\u2019s wealthiest business dynasty, Lopez, modernized <italic>Meralco</italic>\u2019s distribution in 1989 and hired <italic>Baring</italic> to go public by 1992. \nHowever, a surge in power demand led to planned blackouts by the early 1990s. To address this, the Philippine government advocated for independent power producers with guaranteed contracts. Without deregulation legislation, <italic>Meralco</italic> funding <italic>First Private Power </italic>and building a plant in Bauang, becoming operational in 1994. After <italic>Philippine National Bank</italic> privatized, Chinese Filipinos controlled four of the Philippine\u2019s five largest banks, alongside the Basque <italic>Ayala</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Bank of the Philippines</italic>. After Basque <italic>Aboitiz Equity Venture </italic>co-founded Philippine\u2019s largest shipping firm<italic> </italic>with Chinese investors in 1993, they partnered with Japanese shipbuilding conglomerate <italic>Tsuneishi</italic>, forming <italic>Cebu Industrial Park Developers</italic> in 1996. \nAs her lease of Hong Kong ended, Britain transferred Hong Kong to China, leading Singapore\u2019s MMEA to grow 50% since 1992 as an alternative. When interviewing Margaret Ren in 1993, several American investment banks were concerned as her father-in-law former Premier Zhao Ziyang was ejected from government after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. Despite these reservations, <italic>Bear</italic> hired Ren, driving other bankers to hire princelings. <italic>Lehman</italic> recruited Huang Bin, the son of trusted foreign minister Huang Hua, while <italic>Goldman</italic> built its China team around <italic>Harvard</italic>-trained Liu Erfei, the son of a deputy provincial governor. \nLate in 1993, <italic>Smith Barney</italic> poached Erfei with a guaranteed minimum salary of $1 million to establish its China practice. While <italic>Smith Barney</italic> recruited the daughter of Vice-premier Zou Jiahua, CSFB hired the daughter of Ding Guanggen, the former Communist Party propaganda chief and minister of railways. Amidst this competition, <italic>Bear</italic> secured both Margaret Ren and Guanggen\u2019s son, thus winning the mandate to list <italic>Guangshen</italic> RR, which linked Hong Kong to the mainland. \nAfter China passed the Electricity Law of 1995 to shift control from the government to the private sector, CCP established SOE <italic>State Power Corp</italic> in 1997 led by former Premier Li Peng, and regionalized electricity competition. So, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, on the other hand, hired bureaucratic lawyer Wei Christianson. After graduated from <italic>Amherst College</italic> and <italic>Columbia</italic> Law, Wei served as an Associate Director of the Corporate Finance Department at <italic>Hong Kong Securities & Futures Commission</italic>, where she shaped regulations for the forthcoming Mainland Chinese IPOs in Hong Kong in 1993. \nAfter practicing law in New York, she joined <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> as an Executive Director, Beijing Chief Representative, and member of the Resources, Power, and Transportation Group. By then, CITIC sold <italic>Dragon Air</italic> stake and increased <italic>Cathay</italic> share, signaling alignment with the Chinese government. Against inflationary currency flight, China\u2019s central bank raised rates, deflating East Asian electricity and coal. \nMeanwhile, Indonesia\u2019s financial system turned into a crony capitalist family affair. Since Sumitro Djojohadikusumo became trade minister in 1968, his son Hashim acquired interests in three banks. Hashim\u2019s brother-in-law was governor of the central bank and his brother was married to one of President Suharto\u2019s daughters. Of at least 16 banks that Suharto\u2019s children had interests, his son Bambang held a 25% stake in <italic>Bank Andromeda</italic> and was also a co-shareholder in <italic>Bank Tugu</italic>, alongside the state oil company <italic>Pertamina</italic>. Along with his uncle, Bambang was a business partner of Eka Widjaja, who controlled <italic>Bank Internasional Indonesia</italic>. \nTwo of Suharto\u2019s other children owned 32% of <italic>Bank of Central Asia</italic>, alongside <italic>Salim</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Liem and his fellow Overseas Chinese Riady family, which controlled <italic>Lippo Bank</italic> in Jakarta and Chinese Bank in Hong Kong. When the Soeryadjaja family sold <italic>Astra</italic> due to <italic>Bank Summa</italic>\u2019s collapse in 1992, the Suharto family acquired it and formed <italic>Prasetya Mulia. </italic>Likewise, Suharto\u2019s family held substantial influence in Indonesian conglomerates, with three children directing <italic>Citra Lamtoro</italic>, a half-brother was linked to <italic>Mercubuana</italic>, and cousin owning <italic>Golden Truly</italic> supermarkets. \nLeading Malaysia since 1981, PM Mahathir Mohamad and his in-laws connected government, military, and finance. His brother-in-law, General Tan Ali was Chief of the Defense Forces. Furthermore, his brother-in-law Tun Ismail Ali, a former central banker, was Chair of <italic>Permodalan Nasional</italic>, the state-owned investment entity responsible for growing Malay ownership. In 1983, Mohamad initiated import substitution establishing the domestic automobile industry, <italic>Proton</italic>, as a JV between the SOE <italic>Heavy Industries Corp of Malaysia</italic> (\u201cHICOM\u201d) and Japan\u2019s <italic>Mitsubishi</italic>. \nProtective trade barriers, such as import duties, were put in place to safeguard this industry. Along with gaining market share domestically, <italic>Proton</italic> expanded exported to Bangladesh and Britain. As <italic>Proton</italic> increased production capacity and went public in 1992, Mohamad enlisted his classmate and leading Malaysian industrialist Yahaya Ahmad in 1993 to reduce its dependence on Japanese parts. Since the 1970s, Yahaya\u2019s <italic>Diversified Resources </italic>assembled <italic>Isuzu</italic>, <italic>Mitsubishi</italic>, and <italic>Tata</italic> cars domestically. While Mohamad allowed <italic>Diversified Resources</italic> to acquire HICOM\u2019s majority stake in <italic>Proton</italic> in 1995, he grew HICOM and other Malay firms. \nAlong with <italic>Proton</italic> in 1992, Malaysia became among the first in Asia to float the power monopoly following an inefficiency scandal. Amidst a country-wide blackout that year, Malaysia allowed <italic>YTL</italic> construction and other independent companies to produce electricity. Soon after, Vietnam and China transformed their SOE PUs into corporates, with the latter opening coal to foreign modernization in 1993. By 1994, Indonesia and Thailand power authorities created commercial subsidiaries, and Pakistan privatized her PUs. Like Indonesia, Malaysia sold public assets to politicos without competitive bids.\nAlong with investing in Malaysian dams in 1995, PM Mohamad funded South Africa\u2019s ANC, and advocated for \u201cSouth-South\u201d camaraderie like BCCI, as HICOM funded a PU in Tanzania with funding from state-owned <italic>Bank Bumiputra</italic> as another Malaysian group developed one in Kenya. Like Kenya, Ghana privatized wholesale electricity, while Zimbabwe\u2019s monopoly tapped public markets. In Zimbabwe, Mugabe employed crony capitalism along his family and political allies. \nIn 1996, Zimbabwe privatized the Hwange power plant by signing a contract with <italic>YTL</italic>, with directors including Mohamad\u2019s son. Although several other bidders had more experience and offered more favorable terms, <italic>YTL</italic> paid commissions into offshore bank accounts. Even though <italic>BANK</italic> refused to support the project, <italic>YTL </italic>won the bid. As PU monopoly ZESA\u2019s board criticized the agreement, Mugabe excluded them from negotiations, and subsequently dismissed them. He then installed his brother-in-law as Chair and CEO of ZESA.\n<italic>Diversified Resources</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic>Yahaya died in a helicopter accident in 1997, and <italic>Proton</italic> faced restrictions on raising car prices and fierce competition from Korean and Japanese rivals amidst the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>. Amidst steel competition, shorts ran on Malaysia\u2019s <italic>ringgit</italic> in 1997. Despite Malaysia\u2019s PM Mahathir accusations of foreign plots, <italic>Soros</italic> stayed out of currencies and bought Thai steel and Russian assets. Meanwhile, Mahathir\u2019s Deputy PM and Finance Minister, Anwar Inbrahim implemented an IMF-like plan independently, reducing spending, delaying big projects, and refusing to bail out connected firms. Instead, he promoted openness and challenged discriminatory anti-Chinese laws. As AIG bought <italic>SunAmerica</italic> and insurers and banks in Brazil, El Salvador, Poland, Kazakhstan, and Thailand, Mahathir sought to cut AIG\u2019s ownership in a Malaysian subsidiary below 51% until Maurice Greenberg invested in Malaysian industry.\nWithout bankruptcy law, Korea\u2019s <italic>Hanbo </italic>family-led HC fire-sold steel, collapsing Japan\u2019s steel cartel. For IMF aid, Korea liquidated <italic>Hanbo,</italic> banned intra-HC loans, and raised foreign capital. Under IMF guidance, Korea restructured ventures with a<italic> London Club</italic> approach. With government involvement, Hogen Oh, Chair of <italic>Lazard</italic> Asia, led a committee to oversee over a hundred restructuring cases from 1998. As American LBOs bought most of the insolvent banks, Korean formed an independent banking supervisor to regulate loan-to-values. Since former head of FRS <italic>New York</italic> Gerald Corrigan<italic> </italic>joined <italic>Goldman</italic> as a partner, he joined with <italic>Citi</italic> to restructure Korea\u2019s debt against a plan by <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Nicholas Rohatyn by 1998. As <italic>Goldman</italic> sold Korean debt, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> sold privatized Korean banks. \n<italic>Korea First Bank </italic>(\u201cKFB\u201d), once the largest in the nation, faced potential sale as it had fallen to the fourth position. Western financial institutions interested in KFB insisted on buying the entire bank post-bailout, leaving the Korean government with bad loans. TPG proposed implementing the good bank/bad bank model pioneered by TPG in <italic>American Savings Bank</italic> after the <italic>Panic of 1987</italic> to alleviate the Korean government\u2019s burden while potentially revitalizing troubled banks. \nIn 1998, KFB, <italic>Koram Bank</italic>, and <italic>Korea Exchange Bank</italic> received capital from TPG, <italic>Carlyle</italic> and <italic>Morgan</italic>, and <italic>Commerzbank</italic>. In 1999, <italic>Goldman</italic> bought a 17% interest in <italic>Kookmin Bank</italic> and <italic>Olympus Capital</italic> acquired 54% of <italic>Korea Exchange Credit Card</italic>. By 2003, <italic>Commerzbank </italic>bank sold her stake in <italic>Korea Exchange Bank</italic> to Robert Bass\u2014who previously worked with TPG\u2014and John Grayken\u2019s <italic>Lone Star Funds</italic>, extending their strategy from buying S&L assets from RTC following the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>.\nKewsong Lee, the American-born son of a <italic>Yonsei Uni</italic> professor, graduated <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> Business, and worked at <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>McKinsey</italic>, and <italic>Warburg Pincus</italic>. After moving to America with his family, Joseph Bae graduated from <italic>Harvard</italic>, worked for <italic>Goldman</italic> and joined KKR in 1996. Likewise, Michael Chae\u2019s parents moved to America in the 1950s to study there. After studying at <italic>Harvard</italic>, <italic>Cambridge</italic>, and <italic>Yale</italic> Law, he worked as an analyst at <italic>Dillon</italic> and <italic>Carlyle</italic> before joining <italic>Blackstone</italic> in 1997. Korean alumni of <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, Joseph Park and SW Park, returned to Korea and helped local securities firms compete with Western banks. <italic>Lazard</italic> Asia also hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> Partner Patrick Cheung as a Hong Kong Managing Director. \nAs FX squeezed global PUs, their investors ran. Although OPEC produced unlimited oil since the early 1990s, oil deflation in 1997 with Asian demand, squeezing oil exporters. As Indonesia <italic>rupiah</italic> deflated, PUs could not pay <italic>dollar</italic> debts. Despite <italic>BANK</italic> protest, construction of a PU linked to Suharto\u2019s daughter proceeded. After <italic>BANK</italic> suspended the loan, IMF linked new loans to PU rate hikes, sparking a political crisis. Since November 1997, depositors ran from Indonesia\u2019s banks, including the largest, <italic>Bank of Central Asia</italic>, due to their association with Suharto. Amidst calls for more bank closures, a bank owned by Suharto\u2019s son reopened after three weeks under a different name, raising concerns about genuine reform. \nLikewise, Indonesia\u2019s central bank\u2019s lenient monetary policy to prop up those banks accelerated <italic>rupiah</italic> depreciation. While Suharto\u2019s family opposed the closure of 16 banks that they had interests in, <italic>Salim</italic> sold off assets to pay debt, including their Dutch trading giant <italic>Hagemeyer</italic> and flour mills by 1998. But without aid from Suharto as runs intensified, and the <italic>Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency</italic> took over <italic>Bank of Central Asia</italic>. Within days, <italic>Salim</italic>\u2019s European partner <italic>Lyonnise</italic> <italic>Suez </italic>bought him out of their water PU JV. While Suharto-related HCs wanted creditors to take \u2018haircuts\u2019 of at least 30 to 40% on their debts, <italic>Chase</italic>, <italic>Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi</italic>, and <italic>Deutsche </italic><italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> balked, Indonesia added <italic>Chapter 11</italic>-liquidation bankruptcy per IMF. \nAlso in 1998, Philippine conglomerate <italic>Aboitiz Equity Venture </italic>refocused on electricity, selling shares in cosmetics firm <italic>Pilipinas Kao</italic> to Japanese partners, <italic>Consolidated Industrial Gases</italic> and <italic>Southern Industrial Gases</italic> to <italic>British Oxygen,</italic> and her interest in the country\u2019s largest insurance broker, <italic>Jardine Aboitiz Insurance Brokers</italic>, to <italic>Jardine</italic>. With Philippine geography impeding power imports, private utilities and rural cooperatives handle electricity distribution. \nIn 1998, the Philippines unified the Luzon-Visayas grid through a Leyte-Luzon cable, planning a national grid by 2004. <italic>Meralco</italic> led with 80% of customers, followed by <italic>Visayas Electric</italic> at 5%, and Aboitiz\u2019s<italic> Davao Light</italic> at 4%. Since resigning as <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s first\u2019s Asian partner, Perez\u2019s LBO grew into the largest in the Philippines, and served as the local investment vehicle for <italic>Soros</italic> in 1998.\nInstead of marrying the landed gentry like his forebearers, Manuel Lopez married the daughter of President Estrada, a popular Filipino entertainer, in 1999. However, Estrada\u2019s term soon ended and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, daughter of the former President Diosdado Macapagal, assumed the Presidency of the Philippines. \nAfter serving as Undersecretary<italic> </italic>of<italic> </italic>Industry & Investments and Vice Chair and Managing Head of Bureau of Investments<italic>, </italic>Macapagal-Arroyo appointed Perez Energy Secretary in 2001 to implement electric reforms. Concurrently, Perez was the Ex-Officio Chair of <italic>Philippine National Oil </italic>and <italic>National Electrification Administration</italic>. As Perez deregulated and privatized electricity, <italic>Aboitiz</italic> expanded into hydroelectric, coal, and diesel-fired PUs.\nWith her fee hike request rejected amidst a sales slump, <italic>Meralco</italic> experienced a significant net loss in 2002. Despite political criticism, Lopez received contract extensions from the Philippine government in 2003. Mandating <italic>Meralco</italic> pay an overcharge refund that year, the Court suspended a rate increase in 2004. Adapting to the evolving energy landscape, <italic>Meralco</italic> focused on expanding its power generation capacity and upgrading its distribution network. The company also ventured into international markets, responding to increasing competition.\nAfter the ousting of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Cambodia\u2019s new government, the People\u2019s Republic of Kampuchea, was established under Vietnamese control and dominated by a small cadre of former Khmer Rouge defectors, including Hun Sen, Heng Samrin, and Chea Sim. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, as Cambodia transitioned to a multi-party electoral system under the UN\u2019s supervision (1992\u20131993), Hun Sen\u2019s Cambodian People\u2019s Party relied heavily on the military and security forces to secure electoral victories, using intimidation, violence, and fraud. During this period, Hun Sen formed alliances with emerging business tycoons who profited from state contracts and crony capitalist deals, such as Mong Reththy (agriculture), Ly Yong Phat (real estate, energy), and Kith Meng (banking, telecoms). \nMarriages among political and business elites, such as the marriage of Hun Sen\u2019s daughter the son of influential minister Sok An, and the union between Senator Ly Yong Phat\u2019s daughter and businessman Phu Sae Ping, consolidated these power networks. Starting in the 2000s, foreign direct investment, especially from China, became a major source of wealth for these elites, financing projects like real estate developments and energy infrastructure. Hun Sen\u2019s daughter, Hun Mana, emerged as a key figure in the telecoms sector, owning shares in <italic>Metfone</italic>, with close ties to both Cambodian People\u2019s Party and the military. Along with Ly Yong Phat, she owned <italic>Cambodia Electricity</italic>, the country\u2019s second-largest domestic electricity supplier. \nAs her neighbors enacted capital controls, privatized utilities, an energy glut led China to extend <italic>State Power Corp</italic> trials by 1999 and build UST debt reserves to stabilize FX. While <italic>Enron</italic> renegotiated with Indian nationalists, her profits fell amidst rampant theft. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1998</italic>, Thailand nationalized seven troubled finance companies, including <italic>Nava Finance</italic> and <italic>Union Asia Finance</italic>. While the former was an affiliate of <italic>Thai Military Bank</italic> controlled by the armed forces, the major shareholder of the latter was the Overseas Chinese Chen Sophonpanich family, which saw their stake in <italic>Bangkok Bank</italic>, the largest commercial lender, fall to 10 to 20% from around 35% pre-crisis. Overall, the crisis brought about structural changes in the Thai financial landscape, increasing transparency, efficiency, and foreign ownership.\nAs Russian firms monetized energy barter for tax subsidies with promissory notes (\u201c<italic>veksels</italic>\u201d), banks reduced default risk by trading <italic>veksels</italic>. Firms vertically integrated as <italic>Gazprom</italic> and <italic>Transneft</italic> opened pipes to third parties. Since controls overpriced coal relative to gas, strikes grew as Ukrainian and Russian collieries could not pay. While coal and commodity barter grew, PU usage fell. As <italic>Ukr-Gazprom</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> domestic <italic>veksels</italic> grew in 1995, IMF and Russia\u2019s <italic>Gazprom</italic> reorged this debt. As <italic>Lazard</italic> Moscow\u2019s<italic> </italic>Lopukhin, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> bid for Russian oil in 1995, Russian BHCs refused to sell shares to foreign interests. \nSimilarly, privatization battles played out across the former Soviet bloc. In Ukraine, several former <italic>Komsomol </italic>entrepreneurs became influential oligarchs. By the 1980s, Soviet youth experienced the influence of Western music. To manage this cultural exposure, the Soviet government empowered the young communist organization, <italic>Komsomol</italic>, to manage video salons and discos that played Western music. \nUniversity organizers of these ventures became known as the \u2018disco mafia\u2019 and relied on ties with Soviet officials, including the KGB, to navigate the controlled economy. While Christian Dmitri Medvedev organized in Russia, his coreligionists in the Ukrainian political and industrial cities of Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk included Yulia Tymoshenko, Serhiy Tihipko, Petro Poroshenko, and Mikheil Saakashvili. Other Ukrainian organizers included the Jewish Igor Kolomoisky and Muslim Rinat Akhmetov.\nWhile Kolomoisky and Tihipko co-founded <italic>PrivatBank </italic>in 1992, Rinat Akhmetov established <italic>Dongorbank </italic>by 1995. Allied with organized crime and coal and steel magnates in Donbas, Akhmetov supported Viktor Yanukovych, who became Governor of Donetsk in 1997. Akhmetov soon controlled steel and gas enterprises, including monopolizing gas distribution in the Donbas region. \nLikewise, Yulia Tymoshenko combined her father-in-law\u2019s political network with the disco mafia to build a gas empire, as Dnipropetrovsk politicians Leonid Kuchma and Pavlo Lazarenko became President in 1994 and PM in 1996, respectively. Lazarenko\u2019s establishment of regional gas monopolies benefited Tymoshenko\u2019s company, <italic>United Energy System</italic>, which became the primary importer of Russian gas and controlled up to 20% of Ukraine\u2019s GDP. As <italic>Ukrainian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>lent to the government and politically linked commercial banks, hyperinflation led Yushchenko to replace <italic>karbovanetz</italic> with <italic>hryvnia</italic> as the currency by 1996. \nAfter losses hobbled Hungarian banks, foreign investors injecting fresh capital and expertise. While domestic investors helped privatize <italic>Hungarian Savings Bank</italic>, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> and <italic>Schr\u00f6der Wagg</italic> syndicated internationally. Likewise, GE <italic>Capital</italic> and EBRD bought <italic>Budapest Bank</italic>, <italic>Allied Irish</italic> purchased <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>, <italic>Bayerriche Landesbank</italic> and EBRD acquired <italic>Hungarian Foreign Trade Bank</italic>, and ABN AMRO\u2019s took over <italic>Hungarian</italic> <italic>Creditbank</italic> by 1997. Similarly, Poland privatized <italic>Handlowy </italic>in 1997, and <italic>Morgan </italic>acquired nearly a quarter of the shares by 1998. Failing to acquire smaller rivals, <italic>Citi</italic> bought <italic>Handlowy </italic>after a bidding war in 2000. Along with smaller banks in Poland, Italy\u2019s <italic>Unicredit</italic> bought Czechia\u2019s <italic>Zivnostenska Banka</italic>.\nBy 1996 <italic>Safra</italic> funded <italic>Hermitage Capital</italic>, which former BCG consultant and <italic>Salomon</italic> banker William Brower turned into the largest Russia-focused hedge fund and LBO. By 1997, Russia\u2019s <italic>Federal Assembly</italic> allowed foreigners to trade <italic>veksel</italic>, stock, and short-term federal debt (\u201cGKOs\u201d) instead of raising taxes. Yeltsin did not privatize military-industrials or UES, Russia\u2019s electricity monopoly, which Lenin prioritized decades earlier. \nAs Russia\u2019s privatization minister met with <italic>Soros</italic> to discuss growing <italic>Gazprom</italic>, the <italic>Fuel & Energy Ministry</italic> resisted privatizing UES to raise funds for the government\u2019s budget. Worse yet, Russia courts continued allowing local operatives to siphon off privatized assets per the 1992 law. Likewise, privatization was political. As one of Yeltsin\u2019s largest reelection funders, <italic>Alfa</italic>\u2019s Mikhail Fridman gained TNK <italic>Oil</italic> in 1997. A year after Boris Jordan resigned from CSFB Moscow to co-found local investment bank <italic>Renaissance Capital</italic> in 1995, his brother Nicholas became a VP and soon Chair of <italic>Deutsche </italic><italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Grenfell</italic> in London. Missing out on deals, Lopukhin went independent, and <italic>Lazard</italic> Moscow closed in 1997. \nWith low tax collection and growing debts, <italic>ruble</italic> inflation and interest rates were high until <italic>BANK</italic> refinanced in 1997. RCB also announced a floating peg to the dollar. Instead of liberalizing, Russia\u2019s 1998 bankruptcy law allowed hostile bankruptcies as creditors could force bankruptcy for 500 minimum wages overdue for over three months or <italic>veksel</italic> equivalent. As RCB and big banks could not agree on a devaluation in February, GKOs became more unstable. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1997,</italic> Vladimir Potanin\u2019s <italic>Oneximbank</italic> consortium partnered with former First Deputy PM Potanin, the Jordan \u00e9migr\u00e9s,<italic> </italic><italic>Deutsche Grenfel</italic>, <italic>Renaissance Capital</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, and <italic>Soros</italic> to outbid Vladimir Gusinsky\u2019s <italic>MOST</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Bank</italic> syndicate with Berezovsky, <italic>Alfa</italic>\u2019s Fridman, <italic>Menatep </italic>/<italic>Yukos</italic>, CSFB, and <italic>Telefonica</italic> for privatized telecom <italic>Svyazinvest</italic>. This \u2018bankers war\u2019 forced Viktor Chernomyrdin\u2019s governing cabinet to dissolve in March. While growing arrears led Russian coalers to strike in April, <italic>Gazprom</italic> and UES began calling in <italic>veksels</italic>, leading companies to pay in equity.\nBy August, <italic>Safra</italic> alerted UST of money laundry through <italic>Republic</italic> NB. Soon, the Federal Government investigated BONY for money laundering. SVP Natasha Kagalovsky in New York and VP Lucy Edwards in London were suspended but not charged. <italic>Benex</italic>, operated by Edwards\u2019 husband, Peter Berlin, was involved in suspect transactions and visa services for associates of Russian crime figure Semyon Mogilevich. The investigation also examined Khodorkovsky\u2019s<italic> </italic>insolvent <italic>Menatep</italic>, suspected of embezzling IMF loan funds, through Natasha\u2019s husband Konstantin Kagalovsky, who became a banker after representing IMF.\nWhile Soros called for an American bailout and <italic>ruble</italic> devaluation, RCB followed the latter as Russia defaulted domestic on domestic debt\u2014wiping out the main BHCs\u2014and paused GKO payments. With BHCs collapsing, the HC reorgs reached a zenith as the bankruptcy law allowed asset transfers. Although <italic>Alfa Bank</italic> was also hit hard by the devaluation, she paid off creditors, soon becoming Russia\u2019s largest bank. By September, Gerashchenko was back to leading RCB and soon chaired <italic>Vneshtorg</italic> and credit reorg facilities. Amidst Russian losses and Edmond\u2019s poor health, <italic>Safra</italic> sold her American branches to HSBC before Edmond died under mysterious circumstances in 1999. \nWhile President Yeltsin named Viktor Chernomyrdin as acting PM amidst the crisis, he replaced him with Yevgeny Primakov by September 1998. As anti-Semites blamed Jewish oligarchs, Primakov issued an arrest warrant for Berezovsky in April 1999. By May, Yeltsin replaced Primakov with his deputy until August, when he appointed former KGB agent Vladimir Putin as PM. By 2000, Putin replaced Yeltsin as President. \nSince Gerashchenko left from RCB due to illness in March 2002, Russia reformed bankruptcy by October. By 2003, <italic>Hermitage</italic> was up 1,200% since the lows of 1998. In early 2003, BP and the AAR consortium\u2014led by Mikhail Fridman, Len Blavatnik, and Viktor Vekselberg\u2014merged their assets (TNK, <italic>Sidanko</italic>, <italic>Onako</italic>) into a 50/50 partnership, TNK\u2013BP. \nAs Mikhail Khodorkovsky sought to merge <italic>Yukos</italic> with Roman Abramovich\u2019s <italic>Sibneft</italic> and sell a stake to <italic>ExxonMobil</italic> or <italic>ConocoPhillips</italic> that year, Putin had him arrested, tightening state control over energy. By 2004, state-owned <italic>Rosneft</italic> acquired <italic>Yuko</italic>s\u2019 assets and Abramovich sold <italic>Sibneft</italic> to <italic>Gazprom</italic> a year later. Still, Marxists refused to privatize UES. But as investment fell, prices tripled and led to electric ratioing in 2006\u2019s freezing winter. By 2008, Russia privatized and regulated electricity. \nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> aggressively expanded into Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet states, and China. <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> soon serviced seven of Russia\u2019s eleven major oil companies, handling about 25% of oil and gas exports. While <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> was third largest bank in Austria, she had 2,848 branches in 16 countries east of Albania. Since <italic>Enron</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s </italic>collapse, Indian PU subsidizes grew. As East Asia, Czechia, and Turkey (after a crisis in 2002) created SOEs for bank loans like Mexico had, Czechia hired <italic>Lazard</italic> in 2000 to reorg and sell non-performing debt to LBOs. \nSince the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, and LBOs bought Japanese non-performing bank loans. By 2001, <italic>Soros</italic> re-entered Tokyo for buyouts. Likewise, gold fixing internationalized. Since 1994, Sam Jonah turned Ghana\u2019s <italic>Ashanti Goldfields</italic> into an African privatization model through futures contracts to stabilize gold prices, growing production by 40% via acquisitions and the Obuasi mine. \nHowever, gold prices collapsed from May 1999 as Britain decided to sell half her gold supply to build reserves of <italic>euros</italic>, <italic>dollars</italic>, and <italic>yen </italic>after the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>. In Japan by 1999, Yasuo Fukuda, Takeo\u2019s son, rose in the ranks of the Diet\u2019s Foreign Affairs committee before becoming the Chair of the Finance Committee and directing the Treasury Bureau. After <italic>Nikko</italic> closed its London operations, <italic>Lazard</italic> London hired Haruko as a senior advisor in early 1999. Later that year, after Britain sold gold to buy yen and other currencies, the <italic>World Gold Council</italic> hired Haruko to help boost gold sales. \nMeanwhile, since his grandfather Nobusuke Kishi and uncle Eisaku Sato served as PMs between 1957 and 1972, Shinzo Abe served as PM of Japan from 2006 to 2007. He soon lost to Yasuo, who served as Minister of State and Chief Cabinet Secretary from 2000 before becoming PM in 2007. However, he resigned after a year due to conflicts within his party. He continued to represent Gunma in the Diet until 2012 when his son, Tatsuo, succeeded him. By 2012, Shinzo Abe became PM again until 2020. While his brother, Nobuo Kishi, served as Minister of Defense from 2020 to 2022, when Abe was assassinated. \nAs HSBC bought <italic>Safra</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> bank in 2001, <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> joined the pool until <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> replaced her in 2002. From 2002, EU federalized large antitrust cases in late 2002, she shifted smaller ones to the national basis. Earlier that year, America increased steel import tariffs by up to 30% for three years, which led EU to threaten punitive tariffs and file a complaint with the WTO. The dispute continued until November 2003 when the WTO authorized EU to impose retaliatory tariffs, which prompted Bush to abolish the steel tariffs in late 2003.  By 2004, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London withdrew from gold fixing, selling her seat to <italic>Barclay</italic>. \nSince China regionalized electricity in 1997, Sichuan favored her own power plants after the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, leading CCP prefer curtailing provincial monopolies When collapsing energy demand turned to glut, <italic>State Power Corp</italic> extended deregulation trials. But <italic>State Power Corp</italic> refused to relinquish control as demand surged. By late 2001 China allowed <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>\u2019s consortium with <italic>Lehman</italic>, <italic>Salomon</italic>, and LBOs buy the first batch of distressed assets in SOEs, paying about 9% of the book value of the $1.31 billion assets sold. \nAfter 65 coal bankruptcies and 55,000 free collieries shuttered, CCP floated coal prices in 2002. That year, CCP broke <italic>State Power Corp</italic> into three separate components, resulting in the creation of five regional power generation companies. Along with an independent regulator, CCP established two power grid operators, <italic>Southern Power Grid </italic>and <italic>State Grid</italic>, which focused on upgrading and expanding ultra-high-voltage transmission lines. As coal inflated, blackouts spread since PUs could not raise rates in 2003. So, CCP banned coal export, built oil reserves, consolidated SOEs, and subsidized renewables and high-tech. \nWhen the <italic>Panic of 1974 </italic>spurred the Pacific to diversify electricity from oil to coal, South Africa and Australia supplied cheap coal from the 1980s. By then most of ECSC phased out coal mining when organizing the <italic>European Union</italic> (\u201cEU\u201d) in 1993. With the fall of the Soviet Union, some former satellites shuttered and modernized collieries. \nBy 2004, EU added ten countries, including coal-rich Poland and Czechia, and Baltic countries on Russia\u2019s border. While Germany\u2019s gas cartel refused entry to <italic>Gazprom</italic>, both invested in Baltic pipes in 2004. With the <italic>Treaty of Kyoto</italic>, major industrialized countries legally bound themselves to reduce carbon emissions. But while <italic>Kyoto</italic> did not bound developing China or not ratified America, only EU remaining committed to its obligations as Canada, Russia, and Japan withdrew from the treaty.\nAs oil trebled between 2004 and 2007, SOEs\u2014Saudi<italic> Aramco, </italic>Russian<italic> Gazprom, </italic>Chinese <italic>CNPC, </italic>Iranian <italic>NIOC, </italic>Venezuelan<italic> PDVSA, </italic>Brazilian<italic> Petrobras, </italic>Indonesian <italic>Pertamina</italic>, and<italic> </italic>Malaysian<italic> Petronas\u2014</italic>dominated oil. From India to Korea, firms bought coal and oil assets in Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, and Africa. After funding BCCI with Pharaon in the 1970s, Roger Tamraz brokered oil and other assets while attempting to broker peace. He fled to America after Hezbollah took him hostage in 1988. \nWhile continuing to invest in oil. Azeri oil and gas were underdeveloped since the Soviet nuclear shift and collapsed after independence. While Tamraz sought to develop Azeri gas against Russia\u2019s monopoly, Clinton\u2019s Administration did not trust him. By 1999, BP discovered vast fields and exports reached new heights after 2005. \nMeanwhile,  Ukraine\u2019s disco mafia continued to lead banking and industry. Since the early 1990s, Yulia Tymoshenko headed <italic>United Energy Systems</italic>, which managed gas imports under Pavlo Lazarenko. After Lazarenko was dismissed in 1997 for corruption and fled Ukraine, President Leonid Kuchma appointed <italic>Ukrainian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic> Governor Viktor Yushchenko, who had stabilized the <italic>hryvnia</italic> and limited the fallout from the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, as PM in 1999 to restore confidence in government.\nLikewise, fellow disco mafia member Serhiy Tihipko, co-founder of <italic>PrivatBank</italic>, resigned his chairmanship to become Deputy PM for Privatization and Economic Development in 1997 and Minister of Economy in 1999. Also in 1999, Tymoshenko became Deputy PM for Fuel & Energy. As Yushchenko advanced banking laws to make <italic>Ukrainian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic> independent, he clashed with oligarchs who resisted tighter controls.\nYushchenko lost his premiership in 2001, while Tymoshenko was arrested on charges of paying Lazarenko kickbacks. After the charges were dropped, she led protests against Kuchma over the murder of a journalist in 2000 and was later injured in a suspicious car crash. Tihipko, meanwhile, succeeded Yushchenko as Governor of <italic>Ukrainian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic> in 2002.\nAs Yushchenko entered the 2004 presidential race to succeed Kuchma, Viktor Yanukovych launched his campaign with backing from Tihipko and Viktor Medvedchuk. Disco mafia\u2013linked oligarchs from the Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk groups, including Rinat Akhmetov, united behind him to counter Yushchenko, who led in polls with about 23\u201325% to Yanukovych\u2019s 16\u201318%. While Medvedchuk controlled several major television channels, Kuchma\u2019s son-in-law Viktor Pinchuk managed others, leaving only Petro Poroshenko supporting Yushchenko.\nYushchenko emphasized Ukrainian nationalism, pro-EU, and NATO policies, while Yanukovych received financial support from <italic>Gazprom</italic> and promoted Russian as a second state language, dual citizenship, and closer ties with Russia. During the election, however, Attackers poisoned Yushchenko, halting his campaign, and Tymoshenko continued protesting until he resumed campaigning. The Orange Revolution overturned the official results, enabling Yushchenko to assume power. The pro-Russian, coal-heavy Donetsk council endorsed a referendum on autonomy, highlighting regional divisions.\nAs <italic>Gazprom</italic> eliminated Soviet-era gas discounts, only Moldova, Bulgaria, Belarus, and Armenia traded pipes for discounts. Politicized Russian energy price hikes in Ukraine and Georgia spurred democratic revolts. Moreover, Georgia\u2014vital for Russia\u2019s Armenian and Turkish gas monopoly against Azeri competition\u2014arrested Russian spies. So, Russia cut off gas to Ukraine and invaded Georgia in 2008. As Tymoshenko followed Yanukovych as PM in 2009, she committed to developing coal and brokered a natural gas deal with <italic>Gazprom</italic>. From this time, fellow <italic>Kosmopol </italic>alum Igor Kolomoisky illegally funneled at least $750 million from his <italic>Privatbank</italic> through Cyprus to American shell companies to acquire <italic>Warren Steel</italic> in Ohio and other Midwestern assets.i\nSince Congress deregulated inter-state fuel trade and processed oil exports from 1978, crude export bans remained, and gas export approvals took years. While PUHCs used oil before the 1970s, deregulation fostered fuel competition, and gas replaced oil in electricity. <italic>Enron</italic> also led American shale oil and gas drilling. With growing gas stocks in Europe during the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, Putin called Qatar for a gas cartel as gas prices deflated in 2009. While coal shortages shut down PUs across China by 2008, oil deflated as the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic> spread. By late 2009, <italic>Lazard</italic> had restructured two of oil-rich Kazakhstan\u2019s public banks into going concerns. \nAfter Russia restricted flows to Ukraine and Europe, Ukraine elected pro-Russian Yanukovych as President in 2010. While Tymoshenko was accused of abusing authority for the <italic>Gazprom</italic> deal and sentenced to prison in 2011, Yanukovych promoted Mykola Zlochevsky\u2014who had formed <italic>Burisma</italic> in 2002 and began producing natural gas by 2006\u2014to <italic>Minister of Ecology & Natural Resources</italic> in 2010 and a defense minister two years later. Likewise, Syria prohibited Qatar from building pipes to Europe to diversify Russia\u2019s monopoly in 2009. As Syria signed pacts with Iran to build pipes across Iran, rising food prices again spurred riots\u2014this time across former Turk colonies\u2014and sparking civil war in Syria, pitting Russia against Turkey and the West in 2011. So, Turkey built pipes for Azeri gas into Europe. Unlike Syria and Lebanon, Jordan decreased energy subsidies.\nRenewables grew with oil inflation and BHC tax credits, but gas deflation and BHCs lost taxable income after the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>. Congress supported clean energy with cash grants from 2009 but stopped as Europe cut subsidies in 2011. China continued, growing PU subsidies and extending her monopoly over rare earth metals. As revolutions across the energy-subsidy-reforming oil states and Japan\u2019s nuclear catastrophe hiked oil over gas, the White House released <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserves</italic>. \nWith Western capital in retreat, CCP expanded oil SOEs and energy-rich Central Asia from 2013. Losses during the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic> led China\u2019s <italic>State Grid</italic>\u2014alongside nuclear and renewables\u2014to buy PUs in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Oman, Singapore, the Philippines, and Hong Kong\u2019s HEC\u2014and become the world\u2019s largest public utility and fastest-growing firm through COVID. \nSince Elaine Chao became the Secretary of Labor in President Bush Jr\u2019s cabinet in 2001, the first Asian American woman to do so, her husband, Republican Senator from Kentucky Mitch McConnell became Senate Majority Leader in 2015, his wife. Although her father James fled Chinese Communism for Taiwan and America, he remained close with his schoolmate Jiang Zemin, who became Chinese President in 1989. Chao\u2019s <italic>Foremost Shipping</italic> using ships built in Chinese state-owned shipyards with Chinese government financing and signed long-term contracts to transport iron ore for state-owned steel makers. \nThe state in Taiwan owned major industries and the banking system, dominating sectors such as steel, heavy machinery, and semiconductors, contributing to almost half of the nation\u2019s gross domestic capital formation. This control ensured employment for specific follower groups and catered to military needs. Taiwan incentivized specific sectors like electronics and plastics through tax benefits and aid for exporters, mainly using public enterprises to foster sector development and exert significant leadership in crucial industries. Moreover, due to her small population and the lack of domestic markets, Taiwan never went through a phase of import substitution.<italic> </italic>Entrepreneurs, lacking formal banking access, heavily relied on informal networks for capital, allowing successful businesses to evade state control. Despite high business dependence on the state, government agencies intervened less in individual firms compared to Korea.\nOther Taiwanese Americans also formed bridges in technology and with China. While a distant second to <italic>Intel</italic> in global semiconductors, AMD faced competition from NVIDIA. Jensen Huang, was born in Taiwan in 1963 to a Chinese family that had been there since the Japanese occupation of the 1920s and were one of these first to enter the textile industry under the KMT\u2019s development programs in the 1950s. Spending part of his childhood in Thailand, his parents sent him and his brother to America during social unrest in Southeast Asia by 1973. Huang attended <italic>Oregon State</italic> <italic>Uni</italic> and worked as a microprocessor designer at AMD before founding NVIDIA in 1993 with investment from <italic>Sequoia</italic> VC, where he played a pivotal role in 3D-graphics cards and AI technology. After several candidates failed to develop an aggressive vision to impress AMD investors, they hired Lisa Su. Huang\u2019s cousin once-removed, Su, Taiwan, moved to New York from Taiwan at a young age and earned an electrical engineering from MIT. After joining AMD in 2012, she became the first female CEO in 2014, and restructured graphic cards to rival NVIDIA for sale to China.\nIn 1999, <italic>Citi</italic> misjudged global demand for shares of <italic>China National Offshore Oil Corp</italic>, leading to the first withdrawal of a Chinese IPO. As Hong Kong investment bank <italic>Peregrine</italic> failed in 2001, <italic>Citi</italic> hired an unscathed director, Francis Leung, as Asia Investment Banking Chair, who poached Margaret Ren from <italic>Bear</italic> with a salary over $8 million. Ren soon secured lucrative deals, including <italic>China Netcom</italic>, <italic>Mingsheng Bank</italic>, and <italic>China </italic>LIC by 2003. But when SEC investigated whether <italic>China</italic> LIC accounting irregularities should have been disclosed in the IPO, Ren allegedly backdated documents. As Leung terminated her in 2004, the bank failed to fulfill a promise to take an equity stake and collapsed in M&A rankings as <italic>China Construction Bank</italic> severed ties. \nOver <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, <italic>China Construction Bank</italic> chose CSFB to replace <italic>Citi</italic> in 2005. While CSFB\u2019s John Mack poached Christianson from <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> to be China Chair and Country Manager in 2002, she resigned in allegiance as CSFB ejected Mack in 2004. Although Christianson replaced Ren at <italic>Citi</italic>, Mack became CEO of <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>. Frustrated with losing <italic>China Construction Bank</italic>, Christianson left Citi within 18 months and joined Mack at <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> as Managing Director and China CEO by 2006. \nThey competed with many princelings. Jiang Zemin\u2019s son Mianheng was one of the largest deal makers and gatekeepers. Overseeing state-backed investment ventures in telecoms, semiconductors, and construction projects, his high-profile ventures included collaborations with <italic>Microsoft</italic> and <italic>Nokia</italic>. While Mianheng partly controlled <italic>Shanghai Alliance Investment</italic>, his son Alvin co-founded <italic>Boyu Capital</italic> private equity by 2011.\nIn 2004, <italic>Merrill </italic>handled major China IPOs such as <italic>Dongfeng Motor</italic>, <italic>Air China</italic>, <italic>Shenhua Group</italic>, and <italic>China Power International</italic>, attributing this resurgence after a period of underperformance to improved management. Others pointed to the recruitment of Wilson Feng, who was dating the daughter of Wu Bangguo, Chair of <italic>National People</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Congress</italic> and former Vice-Premier of SOEs under Premier Zhu Rongji. While Zhu Rongji\u2019s son Levin was CEO of CICC,<italic> </italic><italic>Merrill </italic>hired the granddaughter of former party Chair Hu Yaobang.<italic> </italic>Since former PM Li Peng led <italic>State Grid</italic>\u2019s predecessor, his daughter Xiaolin was Chair and CEO of <italic>China Power International</italic>, and her brother, Xiaopeng, led another power company. \nLikewise, as the son of Politburo member Liu Yunshan operated state-managed CITIC Private Equity Fund, state-owned <italic>China Development Bank</italic> and CITIC <italic>Capital</italic> funded <italic>Kaixin Investments</italic>, former Politburo member Zeng Peiyan\u2019s VC. And during the world\u2019s largest initial public stock offering in 2006, Wilson Feng secured <italic>Merrill</italic>\u2019s role in ICBC\u2019s IPO. In late 2007, ICBC bought a 20% stake in <italic>Standard Bank of South Africa</italic>, gaining access to 1,061 branches in 18 countries across Africa. Within months, petroleum exploration, real estate transactions, and the presence of about 3,000 Chinese-funded companies in UAE led ICBC to open a branch in Dubai. \nWhile <italic>Merrill </italic>hired Margaret Ren as China Investment Banking Chair in 2007, she resigned along with Head of Asia M&A Kalpana Desai resigned after <italic>Bank of America</italic> bought <italic>Merrill </italic>during<italic> </italic>the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>. So, <italic>Lazard</italic> sought to fill the gap left by bailed out investment banks. Since Chinas new regime deemed Baohang and Mingfu rehabilitated by the 1980s, Baohang\u2019s granddaughter, Lan, was sent to stay with her aunt, and later became an arbitration lawyer in Paris. While <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s Bruce Wasserstein married Angela Chao in early 2009, he died several months after. \nBy 2011, Wasserstein\u2019s successor Ken Jacobs recruited Lan Yan to head <italic>Lazard</italic> Greater China business, the first woman responsible for a region. Yan built a predominantly female team. With the support of Jacobs, Lan led her team of \u2018<italic>Lazard Sisters</italic>\u2019 with a focus on regulated industries, helping Chinese firms make buy <italic>Gloucester Coal</italic> and make minority investments in <italic>Peugeot Citro\u00ebn</italic>. However, as China increased global coal and oil long-term contracts, she dominated rare earth metals refining for semi-conductor chips and renewables. In 2010, she announced a 72% export cut\u2014briefly doing so for Japan\u2014and forcing renewables\u2019 lower value chain production in China. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Deutsche</italic><italic> Bank</italic><italic>\u202f</italic> engaged in a sustained pattern of hiring underqualified relatives of government officials and executives of SOEs across Asia Pacific and Russia. These hires were made at the direct request of influential clients or prospective clients. The hiring process for the hires bypassed <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s formal recruitment standards, including academic and competency benchmarks, testing, and interviews. In many cases, <italic>Deutsche</italic><italic> </italic>employees fabricated or polished resumes, prepped the hires with interview questions and answers, or skipped the interview process altogether. \nIn mid-2011, <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s China joint venture employed the Chinese SOE Chair\u2019s daughter after she failed two admissions tests and performed poorly in interviews. Asia Pacific management then seconded her to Hong\u202fKong. <italic>Deutsche</italic> subsequently concluded a transaction generating $3.75\u202fmillion in fees. In 2012, the Co-Head of Investment Banking in China justified nine analogous hires on projected fee revenue\u2014including the son of SOE executives who, despite internal assessments describing him as one of the worst candidates, secured four mandates from his parents\u2019 entities. Later that year, the China JV disregarded two formal compliance rejections and assigned another SOE Chair\u2019s son to pitch teams without documented approval.\nLikewise, in late \u202f2009, the Chief Country Officer of <italic>Deutsche</italic> Russia engaged a Deputy Minister\u2019s daughter as a temporary analyst in Moscow and transferred her to London ten days later. Within days of her arrival, <italic>Deutsche\u202f</italic> received a Eurobond request for proposal signed by her father. That summer, senior managers recorded a leisure trip with the Deputy Minister\u2019s family as a business expense, and <italic>Deutsche\u202f</italic>obtained the mandate. In mid-2010, the Russia team hired the son of a senior SOE executive as a temporary analyst in Moscow. Despite absenteeism and examination misconduct, the Head of <italic>Deutsche</italic> Investment Bank approved his transfer to London, where he remained until late\u202f2011.\nMeanwhile, American political families from both parties linked Russian investment to defense-related industries. Since Kentucky Senator and Republican leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s connection to Chinese state-owned enterprises involves his wife, Elaine Chao, and her family\u2019s shipping company, <italic>Foremost</italic>. In 2008, the Chao family provided McConnell with between $5 and 25 million to relieve his campaign debt. While McConnell supported <italic>Rusal</italic>, a leading Russian aluminum producer, in establishing an American factory for producing rolled aluminum, essential for military vessels and aircraft, Angela, Elaine\u2019s sister, served on the boards of <italic>China State Shipbuilding Corp</italic> and B<italic>ank of China.</italic> In 2016, <italic>Bank of China</italic> loaned over $2 billion to <italic>Gazprom</italic>, connected to <italic>VTB Bank</italic>, <italic>Rusal</italic>\u2019s key shareholder. \nOn the Democratic side, the Clintons faced controversy over the 2010 sale of <italic>Uranium One</italic>, a Canadian company, to Russia\u2019s <italic>Rosatom</italic>, finalized in 2013. The deal, approved by a federal government committee that included Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State, occurred while individuals connected to <italic>Uranium One</italic> donated over $2.35 million to <italic>Clinton Foundation</italic>. In 2010, Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 for a speech by a Russian bank promoting <italic>Uranium One</italic> stock. At the same time, Russia continued to work against American interests, investing in nuclear power in Iran and Venezuela and oil exploration in Cuba.\nAs DOJ and SEC began enforcing the <italic>Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977</italic>, SEC created a corrupt practices unit in 2010. By 2013, SEC began investigating <italic>Morgan </italic>for employing the children of Chinese officials as bribery to gain business. This legislation also entangled Jho Low. Low\u2019s grandfather, Meng Tak, had amassed wealth in the 1960s and 1970s through iron-ore mining, distilleries, and real estate in Thailand, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. After graduating <italic>Wharton</italic>, Low hosted lavish parties for celebrities and made deals. After Low acquired EMI\u2019s music-publishing business in 2012, New York\u2019s <italic>Park Lane Hotel</italic> in 2013, and <italic>Coastal Energy</italic> in 2014, his bid to buy <italic>Reebok</italic> with Abu Dhabi-affiliated funds failed.\nLow worked with Tim Leissner of <italic>Goldman</italic> Hong Kong, a German who married Judy Chan, a <italic>Goldman</italic> analyst from an Indonesian-Chinese coal magnates. From 2012, Leissner partnered with Jho Low to invest Malaysian development fund (\u201c1MDB\u201d) into power plants in Malaysia, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and UAE. Despite concerns of Low\u2019s wealth, <italic>Goldman</italic> invited <italic>Lazard</italic> to participate in the deal. While <italic>Lazard</italic> refused due to corruption concerns about overpayment on expiring power-sale agreements, <italic>Goldman</italic> continued until the deal fell apart amidst scandal, leading FRS <italic>New York</italic> to require <italic>Goldman</italic> to \u201ccorrect\u201d deficiencies in its internal controls and Malaysia to demand repayment.\nBut although Congress passed weak rules to limit lobbying by relatives of lawmakers, the practices continued. Amidst private bank leaks in 2013, scandal forced Stepic to resign from <italic>Raiffeisen</italic>. While advising on KKR\u2019s billion <italic>euro</italic> acquisition of a Balkan broadcaster and the Slovenian government\u2019s sale of the country\u2019s second-largest bank to <italic>Apollo</italic> and EBRD, <italic>Lazard</italic> hired away <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> staff and Bozidar Djelic, former <italic>McKinsey</italic> consultant and Serbian finance minister, to lead <italic>Lazard</italic> in Central and Eastern Europe.\nWhen VP Biden flew <italic>Air Force</italic> on an official trip to China in 2013, he took his son Hunter, who used the trip to connect with a Chinese business partner, whom he introduced to his father. Subsequently, Hunter fused his investment firm\u2014along with the stepson of Obama\u2019s former Secretary of State John Kerry\u2014into BHR, a newly formed Chinese advisory firm to help <italic>Bank of China</italic> and other Chinese SOEs to make politically sensitive investments outside of China. The same year, Zlochevsky\u2019s <italic>Burisma</italic> hired America\u2019s VP Joseph Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, naming him to the board with a prorated monthly salary of $42,000, while his father was the Obama administration\u2019s point person on Ukraine. \nWith debt financing struggles growing in 2013, President Yanukovych agreed with Russia to turn away from EU for debt forgiveness, leading Ukrainians to revolt. Dueling Ukrainian political factions during the 2013 political crisis actively sought to sway American policymakers and Congress. While pro-Yanukovych groups paid $560,000 to former Republican congressional leaders Vin Weber and Billy Tauzin and $900,000 to John Podesta\u2019s brother Anthony\u2019s <italic>Podesta Group</italic>, former Democratic Congressman Jim Slattery\u2019s law firm represented imprisoned Yulia Tymoshenko. By 2014, however, Russia invaded, annexed Crimea, and spurred insurgency in eastern Ukraine, leading America to support Ukraine. \nWhile Ukraine won, she lost much of her industrial east, and <italic>Shell</italic> left. When a Ukrainian prosecutor began investigating corruption at <italic>Burisma</italic>, VP Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the prosecutor. As <italic>Lazard</italic> advised Ukraine to restructure sovereign debt and state-owned banks <italic>Ukreximbank</italic> and <italic>Oschadbank</italic>, Germany supported Russia in building pipes across the Baltic to diversify gas transport. Although nuclear accounted for 80% of French energy, Germany depended on Russian gas after committing as she closed coal and nuclear plants. \nBy 2016, fellow <italic>Kosmopol </italic>alum Igor Kolomoisky\u2019s <italic>PrivatBank </italic>crumbled as <italic>Warren Steel</italic> experienced two explosions, injuring workers and leading to safety violations. Four of their steel companies went bankrupt, leaving $381 million in debts, while other properties were lost to foreclosure due to unpaid taxes and bills. As <italic>PrivatBank </italic>was nationalized, founder Kolomoisky was imprisoned and soon sought by America.i\nWhile imprisoned Tymoshenko remained the most powerful woman in the former Soviet Union, several female central bank chairs started after the Soviet Union broke apart into 15 countries, namely Tatiana Paramonova (Russia, 1994 to 1995) and Tamara Vinnikova (Kyrgyzstan, 1996 to 1997), mostly men ruled. While Mukhammedova Shakersoltan chaired in Turkmenistan for over a decade, Nadejda Ermakova led in Belarus and Zina Asankojoieva in Kyrgyzstan between 2011 and 2014. From then, Elvira Nabiullina served at <italic>Bank of Russia</italic> since June 2013 and Valeriya Gontareva at <italic>Ukrainian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>since 2014.\nWith FA2010 and anti-money laundering compliance, banks retreated from risky correspondents. So, low-tax, blockchain-enabled crypto-currencies\u2014mainly <italic>Bitcoin</italic> and <italic>Ether</italic>\u2014grew payments using subsidized Chinese coal-based electricity, worsening security, inflation, and climate. Moreover, America began using financial sanctions as economic weapons. After Russian operatives killed <italic>Hermitage</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>lawyer, Congress and Britain sanctioned them by 2013. As Russia cut gas to Europe, Congress deregulated gas and crude exports, and Cyprus and Ethiopia sought <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s advice in 2014. Unlike France, America sanctioned Sudan. As <italic>Paribas</italic> remained, America fined her $9 billion in 2014. Along with renewables subsidizes in 2015, Congress tariffed Chinese imports. \nDespite the <italic>Treaty of Kyoto</italic> decreasing influence, major emitters adopted domestic policies. As central bankers and finance ministers from the G-20 asked the <italic>Financial Stability Board</italic> (\u201cFSB\u201d) to propose how the financial could price carbon in April 2015, America, China, and Russia signed the <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> with most of the world reduce carbon on their own terms and FSB established an industry-led task force to develop voluntary and consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for companies by yearend. From 2016, Jim Kim\u2019s <italic>BANK</italic> secured funds from <italic>Allianz</italic> and <italic>Prudential</italic> insurers for infrastructure investments, initiated a bond offering with <italic>Apollo</italic> LBO for a debt purchase in developing countries, and collaborated with Thiam\u2019s <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> to enable client investments in specific <italic>BANK</italic> projects. \nKoreans like Kim thrived in private equity. Kewsong Lee joined <italic>Carlyle</italic> in 2013 and was appointed as co-CEO in 2018, soon forming a strategic alliance and investing $200 million in the Korean banking group KB <italic>Financial</italic>. Fellow Korean Joseph Bae became co-President of KKR in 2017. By 2015, <italic>Blackstone</italic> promoted Michael Chae to CFO. His company has continued its investments in Korea, including the takeover of a logistics center in <italic>Incheon</italic> and the acquisition of a partial stake in <italic>Starfield Hanam</italic> shopping mall.\nMeanwhile, China continued to expand her influence globally using SOE and private vehicles. The most prominent of the later was CEFC <italic>China Energy</italic> (\u201cCEFC\u201d). While in his twenties, Fujian-born Ye Jianming founded CEFC in 2002, soon acquiring the oil assets of Lai Changxing, a businessman who fled to Canada after China convicted him of smuggling and bribery. Ye obtained funds for the purchase from investors in Hong Kong and Fujian. Amidst the 2011 global commodity market crunch, Wang Sanyun, the party chief of northwestern China\u2019s Gansu province, backed CEFC\u2019s acquisition of Shenzhen-listed <italic>Huaxing Chemical Industry</italic> in 2012, a deal that helped raise over $300 million. Along with forming partnerships with <italic>China Huadian</italic>, <italic>Huainan Mining</italic>, and other Chinese SOEs, CEFC expanding overseas. \nAfter Czechia elected Milos Zeman in 2013, the first China-friendly president prioritized boosting trade with Beijing. After President Xi visited in 2015, CEFC invested in football club <italic>Slavia Prague</italic>, a publishing house, historic buildings, one of the oldest breweries, and a controlling interest in Prague\u2019s <italic>J&T</italic>. As energy private equity<italic> J&T </italic>operated banks in Czechia, Russia, Croatia, Barbados, and euro zone member Slovakia, CEFC became the first private Chinese company to own a European bank. Likewise, Zeman quietly appointed an economic adviser. The same year, CEFC signed oil investment agreements in Kazakhstan, Qatar, Russia, Chad, Angola, and Abu Dhabi.\nOn a wider scale, China\u2019s major firms connected with firms and capitalist directors globally. Directors from China\u2019s largest corporations\u2014such as <italic>ICBC</italic>, <italic>PetroChina</italic>, <italic>Alibaba</italic>, and CICC\u2014affiliated with American investment banks and consultancies. Likewise, Western directors connected those firms to China. From America, TPG\u2019s David Bonderman connected CICC to firms like Irish <italic>Ryanair</italic> and Russia\u2019s <italic>VTB Bank</italic>. While <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s Adam Keswick held directorates with <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Houghton Club</italic>, and <italic>Hong Kong Association</italic>\u2014<italic>Hutchison Whampoa</italic>\u2019s Edith Shih bridged Chinese capital to global consulting and governance circuits via her roles in <italic>Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Secretaries</italic>. Petere Levene connected British <italic>Lloyd</italic>, French <italic>Total</italic>, and America insurer <italic>Starr</italic> with <italic>China Construction Bank</italic>, which Willem Kok linked to Dutch <italic>Shell</italic>, ING, and KLM. \nIn Iran, meanwhile, the Supreme Leader continued expanding religious charitable foundations to control assets. Since Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution, these foundations systematically confiscated land and property from political opponents, religious minorities, and exiled Iranians, further consolidating their economic power. While <italic>Imam Reza Foundation</italic> had started to oversee Shrine donations in Mashhad, it acquired vast economic holdings in construction, agriculture, energy, telecommunications, and financial services. Leaders of such foundations remained close to the ruler. After Abbas Tabasi\u2014whose daughter married a son of Supreme Leader Khamenei\u2014led <italic>Imam Reza Foundation</italic>, Khamenei appointed fellow Ebrahim Raisi\u2014a fellow descendant of the Prophet Muhammad and future president\u2014as his successor.\nWhile Congress sanctioned Iran\u2019s oil sector since the 1980s, they similarly extended the sanctions to trade financing in 2011 and 2013 amidst protests, and soon the foundations. Likewise, President Obama\u2019s executive order banned Russian and Venezuelan oil from 2014 amidst crack downs on civil protest. By 2017, President Trump\u2019s Congress codified sanctions against Russian oil. \nLikewise, China focused on building a military to be capable of \u2018fighting and winning wars\u2019, as articulated by Leader Xi. Along with global infrastructure investment, Beijing asserted ownership of various islands across the South and East China Seas. Although China claimed to mirror the <italic>Monroe Doctrine</italic>, she lacked the regional support that the latter had. So, bolstered by regional alliances, America challenged China\u2019s sovereignty by joining India, Japan, and Australia to form the <italic>Indo-Pacific Quad</italic> in 2017. China also expanded its military globally, with bases in Djibouti near the Red Sea, Gwadar port in western Pakistan, port facilities at either end of the <italic>Panama Canal</italic>, and the Solomon Islands by the 2020s. \nBy late 2017, CEFC agreed to acquire a 14% stake in Russia\u2019s <italic>Rosneft</italic> for $9.1 billion, establishing itself as the third-largest shareholder in the world\u2019s largest listed oil firm. But as CEFC bought 20% of America\u2019s <italic>Cowen</italic> investment bank and sought to increase her interest in <italic>J&T</italic> from under 10 to 50%, bank regulators scrutinized her expansion due to opaque ownership and affiliation with CCP and military officials. America\u2019s <italic>Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States</italic> (\u201cCFIUS\u201d) raised concerns, leading to the abandonment of a proposed $100 million bid for <italic>Cowen</italic>. In Europe, ECB and Czech regulatory authorities blocked the <italic>J&T</italic> takeover.\nMeanwhile, from democratic elections to commerce, artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) compressed intermediary services. As Japan announced a smart AI society in 2016, Russia, China, and America funded military applications. Chinese tech partial-SOEs benefited from broad digital adoption and AI subsidies. ZTE continued selling to Iran. Since America nearly collapsed ZTE by briefly banning imports in 2017, she banned certain technologies sales to ZTE before other SOEs. As America barred direct Chinese purchases of sensitive and strategic industries, <italic>Goldman</italic> and China\u2019s sovereign investment fund (\u201cCIC\u201d) established the <italic>China-America Industrial Cooperation Partnership</italic> in 2017 to channel Chinese capital into American companies. The fund\u2019s activities encompassed diverse sectors, ranging from cybersecurity to supply chains and technology. CIC began extending similar cross-border funds in Britain, Japan, Italy, and France.\nAfter Trump became President in 2017, <italic>Burisma</italic> added Cofer Black, a former CIA official and foreign policy adviser to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, to her board. While doubling gas production via mergers, which remained small without fracking. Amidst Democrat accusations of Russian interference in the election, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted former Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates on multiple charges, including money laundering, operating as federal agents of the Ukrainian government. Like Manafort, <italic>Podesta</italic> also lobbied on behalf of Ukraine\u2019s pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, leading over a dozen clients to cut ties. While Anthony Podesta shuttered <italic>Podesta </italic>in late 2017, most of the former principals regrouped in the new <italic>Cogent Strategies</italic>.\nBetween 2017 and 2018, Hunter received $2.4 and 2.2 million from Chinese and Ukrainian interests, respectably. While shrouding his father\u2019s involvement, Hunter transferred $1.4 million to his uncle James Biden. The business started weeks after his father left the White House in 2017 as Hunter met CEFC\u2019s founder, Ye Jianming in Miami, where they discussed potential American business ventures, including an unsuccessful $40 million JV for liquefied natural gas production in Louisiana. By August 2017, Hunter acquired a 10% equity interest in BHR and started a consulting deal with CEFC, agreeing to represent Patrick Ho, a CEFC official and former Hong Kong Secretary of Home Affairs. \nIn November 2017, Ho was arrested by the FBI in a New York City airport for bribing officials in Chad and Uganda to obtain oil permits. CEFC faced heightened scrutiny after America detained two former senior Hong Kong and Senegal government officials from corruption and money laundering. DOJ accused Ho of bribing African officials on behalf of CEFC. In September, Chinese authorities sought Ye\u2019s assistance in a graft investigation involving former party chief Wang Sanyun, detained on corruption charges in July. By February 2018, Ye was detained, added uncertainties to the planned $9 billion stake in Russia\u2019s <italic>Rosneft</italic>.\nBy 2018, Ukraine decontrolled domestic gas for development. As <italic>Gazprom</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> pipes entered the Baltic since 2004, Trump sanctioned a German port in supporting the offshore pipeline in 2020. Cut off from <italic>dollars</italic>, sanctioned countries ran to gold. One of the largest artisanal gold traffickers was Russia\u2019s <italic>Wagner Group</italic>. Founded in 2014 by Putin\u2019s ally, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, the private military company recruited prisoners to fight against Ukraine. Shortly after, <italic>Wagner</italic> expanded to Syria, Mali, the Central African Republic, and UAE.\nAs gas cost less than oil, Congress protested as growing American gas exports to Europe inflated domestic prices. Although Congress deregulated gas exports to Europe after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, these exports\u2014along with Ukrainian gas deregulation\u2014limited <italic>Gazprom</italic>-Russia state revenues. Desperate, Russia invaded Ukraine. As the West sanctioned banks, <italic>ruble</italic> creditors ran from Russian debt ahead of the first default since 1918. Energy prices grew further as the West boycotted Russian fuel until the White House released record <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserves</italic>, pushing reserves to a four-decade low. \nWhile UST allowed India and others to buy it, she prohibited the use of Western insurance and financing. Since the White House prevented oil pipes from North Dakota and Canada,<italic> Berkshire</italic>\u2019s railroads gained for transporting that same oil. The centrality of energy to <italic>Berkshire</italic> soon became even more apparent. While Chair Warren Buffet (age 94) named Ajit Jain (age 66) as Vice Chair for Insurance Operations and <italic>Berkshire </italic>Energy\u2019s Gregory Abel (age 55) as Vice Chair for Noninsurance Operations in 2018, Abel became heir apparent by 2021.\nAs China sought to rein in large conglomerates in 2018, they took control of <italic>Anbang Insurance</italic>. A week, with CEFC\u2019s Ye Jianming under investigation for economic crimes, the Shanghai municipal government\u2019s investment agency took over CEFC. By November 2019, CEFC\u2019s financing arm was officially delisted from the Shenzhen bourse. Concurrently, regulators revoked the business licenses of a security affiliate. By 2020, during America\u2019s presidential debates, Joseph Biden denied Trump\u2019s claims that Hunter earned any money through business dealings in China. Either way, Hunter divested his BHR interest and resigned from <italic>Burisma</italic> after his father won the election. In April 2020, a Shanghai court declared CEFC bankrupt. Since 2019, Hunter pivoted to producing art for sale. Investigating Hunter, a gay, Democrat IRS agent was suspicious that Hunter\u2019s income streams from <italic>Burisma</italic> through art sales were structured as loans to avoid tax payments. After alleging a cover up in 2023, the IRS agent was removed allegedly on DOJ orders.\nLike in other countries, Sun Guofeng, formerly head of <italic>Central </italic><italic>Bank of China</italic> monetary policy department, was imprisoned for taking $3 million of bribes and disclosing classified information from 2002 to 2020. As public frustration over social inequality and entrenched elites grew, President Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201c<italic>common prosperity</italic>\u201d campaign, launched in 2021, began reshaping China\u2019s financial sector, particularly investment banking. After CITIC<italic> Securities</italic>\u2019 profits fell by 8% in 2022, the firm responded by cutting banker salaries by up to 15% in 2023, aligning with the government\u2019s push to curb excessive wealth in the industry. Regulators imposed stringent measures on bankers, including restrictions on overseas travel and confiscation of passports, as part of a broader crackdown on corruption and capital market irregularities. By mid-2024, corruption probes intensified, leading to the detention of several senior bankers. After <italic>Haitong Securities</italic> reported a 75% profit drop in its first-half results for 2024, deputy general manager Jiang Chengjun attempted to flee but was repatriated and arrested in August. His arrest accelerated the merger of <italic>Haitong</italic> with <italic>Guotai Junan Securities</italic>, creating China\u2019s largest brokerage.\nSimilarly, the Communist Party Secretary-General targeted Vietnam\u2019s top business leaders and officials in his anti-corruption campaign. In 2022, Lan, Chair of <italic>Van Thinh Phat</italic>, was arrested for issuing illegal bonds and using Vietnam\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Saigon Commercial Bank</italic> (\u201cSCB\u201d), fraudulently. Her case caused depositors to run from SCB, leading <italic>State Bank of Vietnam</italic> to take control of the bank and assure customers their deposits were safe. Still, credit institutions became more cautious in managing credit. While Lan was sentenced to death, her husband received a nine-year sentence, and her niece was sentenced to 17 years. The 82 convictions included 45 SCB executives, 15 <italic>State Bank of Vietnam</italic> officials (with the chief inspector receiving a life sentence for accepting a bribe), and several officials from the Government Inspectorate and State Audit offices.\nLikewise, China continued aggressive geopolitics. Land disputes and border skirmishes with India, particularly in 2020, have punctuated China\u2019s territorial ambitions, while its relations with Moscow have grown closer, marked by Xi and Putin\u2019s \u2018no limits\u2019 cooperation during the 2022 <italic>Winter Olympics</italic>. Likewise, China opportunistically extended energy contracts and sold other goods. Overturning their decision to trade oil in <italic>dollars</italic> since the 1970s <italic>Bretton Woods</italic>-like agreement, the Gulf began to transition settling in Chinese <italic>yuan</italic>. After Congress banned advanced AI chips to China, businesses diversified from China to India, and TA2022 fostered domestic rare earth metal mining and technology to reduce inflation in transition from oil and coal.  Soon after, the Biden Administration told <italic>Andreessen Horowitz</italic> and other VCs not to fund AI startups and suggesting a strict government controlled cartel over the AI market.\nAs Western businesses left Russia, remaining banks like HSBC and <italic>Bank of America</italic> scaled back operations. Only <italic>Raiffeisen</italic> grew, managing up to half of Russia\u2019s money flows with the West. After almost a year of invasion, Russia refocused on destroying nationwide electricity ahead of the winter. Like UST aided Ukraine,<italic> BlackRock</italic>\u2019s FMA extended private capital. Although private lenders reduced risk exposure, state-owned <italic>Oschadbank</italic> offered subsidized loans to support the cash-strapped government and maintain financial stability during the occupation. While Ukraine\u2019s state-owned banks were plagued by related party lending and hidden losses, the central bank nationalized previously <italic>Alfa Bank </italic>Ukraine, which was solvent but owned by sanctioned Russian businessmen, including Mikhail Fridman. An outspoken critic of Putin, Daniel Rapoport was found dead in DC in 2022.\nBlaming Russia\u2019s military leadership for losses in Ukraine, Prigozhin\u2019s <italic>Wagner</italic> marched on Moscow in June 2023 before agreeing to stand down and relocating to Belarus. Prigozhin died in a plane crash under suspicious circumstances two months later. Despite expectations that <italic>Wagner</italic> would be dismantled, the group was restructured under the Russian Ministry of Defense. <italic>Wagner</italic> supported Mali\u2019s military junta against Tuareg rebels and engaged in political violence across Libya, the Central African Republic, Chad, Mozambique, Sudan, and Mauritania. Russian private military companies also deployed forces to Burkina Faso and Niger. By August 2024, the military juntas of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso accused Ukraine of aiding Sahel rebels.\u00a0\nWhile blockchain automated supply chain financing, global shippers ended a 2018 trial by 2022. Blockchain also made SPVs cheaper. After <italic>Morgan </italic>forked <italic>Quorum</italic> from the <italic>ConsenSys</italic>-supported <italic>Ether</italic> chain, <italic>XinFin</italic> forked XDC from <italic>Quorum</italic> in 2018. By 2020, <italic>Morgan </italic>sold <italic>Quorum</italic> to <italic>ConsenSys</italic> to foster industry buy-in before strategically investing in <italic>ConsenSys</italic> with <italic>MasterCard</italic> and UBS in 2021. Through 2022, <italic>Morgan </italic>tokenized deposits on XDC with Singapore\u2019s central bank. \n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Recent Panics of </italic><italic>the </italic><italic>Global South</italic>\nLike the Bhuttos of Pakistan, nationalist populist dynasties thrived in the Global South against White capitalism. Back in 1540, Spaniard Jeronimo Zelaya received a royal land grant in Olancho. His descendants included Pedro Zelaya, a prominent mine owner in Tegucigalpa, and his brother, Father Jos\u00e9 Zelaya, who oversaw the construction of the city\u2019s cathedral in 1765. The Zelaya intermarried with other semi-feudal families, including the Bustillo landholders of Olancho, who in turn married with the Reina, Callejas, and Suarez families. By 1893, Santos Zelaya became President of Nicaragua in 1893 after a Liberal revolt. As he consolidated power across Central America and challenged Anglo-American influence, President Taft aided in his overthrow. Still, this cousinhood remained in power, with Suarez cousin-in-law Francisco Bertrand President of Honduras.\nIn 1936, wealthy coffee planter Anastasio Somoza, a third great nephew of the husband of Zelaya\u2019s daughter\u2019s aunt-in-law, became President of Nicaragua. Somoza\u2019s regime, closely allied with America during WWII, secured economic aid and infrastructure support for Nicaragua, indirectly bolstering the family\u2019s economic interests. Along with extensive cattle ranches, coffee plantations, and prime urban real estate holdings, the family <italic>Fabrica Montelimar</italic>, <italic>Momotombo Match Co</italic>, and shipping monopoly <italic>Marina</italic> <italic>Mercante Nicarag\u00fcense</italic> by the 1950s. After Anastasio was assassinated in 1956, his son Luis became President, establishing <italic>Banco Central de Nicaragua</italic> in 1961. As Luis died from a heart attack in 1967, his brother succeeded him. \nThe Managua earthquake of 1972 brought substantial international aid, yet suspicions that Somoza looted relief funds using <italic>Banco Central</italic> catalyzed opposition. Somoza\u2019s reelection in 1974 further spurred resistance by wealthy families, such as the Pellas family. Connected to Somoza through blood and marriage, Silvio Pellas served as Vice Consul of Nicaragua in San Francisco, operated a coffee importing and exporting business with offices in San Francisco and New York, and managed sugar plantations and cattle ranches in Nicaragua until his death in 1952. After the American embargo against Cuba in the early 1960s, the family expanded into sugar cane cultivation and consolidated ownership of the largest sugar factory in Central America. Along with their Chamorro in-laws, the Pellas led <italic>Banco de America</italic>, <italic>Banco Nicarag\u00fcense</italic>, and sugar and rum interests. \nPedro Chamorro, another relative returning from exile in America, became publisher of<italic> La Prensa</italic> and criticized Somoza. As Chamorro\u2019s assassination in early 1978 abuses led President Carter to curtail aid. The diminishing support from America galvanized opposition. By July 1979, Somoza fled Nicaragua and was later murdered by Marxist Argentine guerrillas. From July 1979, the working-class Marxist revolutionary Daniel Ortega<italic> </italic>assumed control of Nicaragua. Ortega<italic> </italic>swiftly nationalized domestic banks, insurance, mining, fishing, and forestry, while allowing foreign banks to operate but prohibiting them from accepting local deposits.\nTo avoid government expropriation during the Sandinista revolution of 1979, the Pellas family transferred their assets offshore, including 35% of <italic>Banco de America</italic>, with the aid of <italic>Wells Fargo</italic>, which held 18% of <italic>Banco de America</italic>\u2019s stock. Francisco Alfredo Pellas Chamorro oversaw the operation, and his sons took leadership roles in the family\u2019s enterprises: Carlos became Chair of <italic>Popular Bank</italic> of Florida, Alfredo Jr became Chair of <italic>BAC</italic>, and Silvio Pellas managed other business interests in Nicaragua. Despite the political upheaval, the family retained ownership of the <italic>Toyota</italic> and <italic>General Motors</italic> dealerships as well as their rum distillery. Ingenio San Antonio, their sugar mill, was confiscated in 1988 and returned in 1989.\nIn 1985 Nicaragua\u2019s Marxist government implemented a decree easing state control over its banking system, allowing the establishment of privately owned local exchange houses. As Joaquin Chamorro took over <italic>Banco Central de Nicaragua</italic>, Nicaragua\u2019s application to <italic>Inter-American Development Bank </italic>(\u201cIADB\u201d) for an agricultural loan faced opposition from the largest contributor to IADB, America, which feared that loans would free up funds to consolidate Marxism within the country for regional export. Chamorro accused IADB of aligning with American political interests. Since Pedro Chamorro\u2019s widow Violeta continued publishing, she succeeded Ortega as President of Nicaragua from 1990, Central America\u2019s first female leader and Nicaragua first peaceful Democratic transition. To combat the country\u2019s hyperinflation crisis, she helped introduce the gold <italic>cordoba</italic>. \nExcept for when Honduras served as a base for America\u2019s operations against Ortega, the Liberal Party dynasty ruled like in Nicaragua. It began with Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Bustillo, who was VP under President Terencio Sierra from 1898 to 1902. His son, Antonio Reina Bustillo, co-founded the Liberal Party and served as Chief Justice of Honduras\u2019 from 1905 to 1910. Antonio Reina Bustillo\u2019s grandson, Antonio Reina Castro, led the Liberal Party during the Car\u00edas dictatorship from 1924 to 1949, hold various public offices, including Minister of Public Works. Antonio\u2019s son, Carlos Reina, followed Raphael Callejas as President of Honduras from 1994 to 1998. Carlos\u2019 nephew married the daughter of Carlos Flores, who succeeded Carlos until 2002.\nCarlos Reina\u2019s cousin was Santos Zelaya\u2019s second cousin once removed, the wealthy Jose Zelaya, who was connected farmers in Olancho. Jose was implicated in the 1975 massacre of land reform protesters but was released after seven years in jail without a conviction. While his son Carlos served a decade in prison for his involvement in murders in the early 1980s, another son, Hector, was involved in drug trafficking and was murdered in the 1970s. A third son, Manuel. engaged in sawmilling and later led Honduras\u2019 Logging Association, he married Xiomara, whose father Irena Castro, was a lawyer with ties to National Party figures, including businessman Miguel Facusse and former President Raphael Callejas. Manuel Zelaya, served as an anti-American congressman from 1986, Director of the Social Investment Fund during Carlos Reina\u2019s presidency, and as President himself after Carlos Flores. \nSince becoming President of Haiti in 1957, Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier grew into a dictator, and replaced the White French-born Archbishop with Francois-Wolff Ligond\u00e9 in 1966, who became Haiti\u2019s first Black Archbishop. Francois-Wolff\u2019s brother Matar married Soeurette Delatour, and their daughter Aurore married Ernest Bennett, a mulatto businessman who descended from Haiti\u2019s first Black king, King Henri Christophe. \nAfter Fran\u00e7ois died in 1971, his twenty-year-old son Jean-Claude assumed the presidency, marrying Mich\u00e9le, the daughter of Aurore and Ernest Bennett, in 1980. The President allowed his new father-in-law Ernest to dominate coffee exports with duty exemptions. When General Henri Namphy overthrew Duvalier in 1986, Leslie Delatour, the<italic> Uni of Chicago</italic>-trained son of Soeurette, married Namphy\u2019s niece, and served as Haiti\u2019s finance minister in the 1980s and led <italic>Central Bank of Haiti</italic> in the early 1990s. \nAs more decolonized nations embraced Marxism, Communists seized control of Belgian Congo in 1965, Mobutu Sese Seko declared a new government and established the single-party rule in 1967. Enforcing Africanization and renaming the country Zaire, Mobutu later aligned with Maoist China and consolidated power through state patronage and suppressed dissent and Communism. Since South Africa imprisoned her brother along with other members of the illegal <italic>African National Congress</italic> (\u201cANC\u201d) and <italic>South African Communist Party</italic> in 1960, Ethel Katz co-founded an initiative to coordinate efforts for release political prisoners and set the stage for a free South Africa. Serving as the executive secretary for <italic>Anti-Apartheid Movement</italic> since 1967, she became Vice Chair in 1974 with the release of her brother.\nAnthony Tuke, the son of former <italic>Barclay</italic> Chair William Tuke, joined the bank in 1946. He trained in the Hampstead branch and other London branches before being posted to <italic>Barclay</italic> South Africa in 1948. In 1966, he joined the board of <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s colonial bank, of which he became Chair in 1968. By 1973, he became Chair of <italic>Barclay</italic>. He oversaw the bank\u2019s South African operations, the bank\u2019s largest subsidairy. Tuke opposed sanctions but maintained banking services for non-white customers. After the Soweto riots in 1976, <italic>Barclay</italic>\u2019s investment in South African Defense Bonds drew criticism. Tuke pledged to sell the bonds and ceased foreign-currency lending to South Africa. In 1978, Nigeria withdrew all deposits from <italic>Barclay</italic> in protest.\nWhile Portugal\u2019s <italic>National Overseas Bank</italic> ceased activities in Portuguese India in 1961 and in Portuguese Timor in 1975 due to occupations, former Portuguese colonies established national banks from 1975, including: <italic>Banco Nacional da Guin\u00e9-Bissau</italic>, <italic>Banco de Cabo Verde</italic>, <italic>Banco Nacional de S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 e Pr\u00edncipe</italic>,<italic> Banco de Mo\u00e7ambique</italic>, and <italic>Banco de Angola</italic>. \nAfter the Marxist <italic>People</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Movement for the Liberation of Angola</italic> (\u201cMPLA\u201d) had a military victory in Luanda and gained control of Angola\u2019s coastal oilfields, Angola gained independence from Portugal and MPLA\u2019s Antonio Neto became Angola\u2019s first president. As Angola embraced Marxism and nationalized the currency monopoly <italic>Banco de Angola</italic> and largest commercial bank <italic>Banco Commercial de Angola</italic>. These two banks accounted for 87% of the country\u2019s activities. (<italic>National Overseas </italic>remained the only issuing and commercial bank in the gold-port of Macao.)\nBut as Communist MPLA gained power, the opposing <italic>National Union for the Total Independence of Angola</italic> (\u201cUNITA\u201d) started a civil war by 1975. With most Portuguese settlers fleeing, Neto nationalized the Portuguese oil firm to establish <italic>Sonangol</italic>, which soon becoming MPLA\u2019s primary revenue source as oil accounted for over 90% of Angola\u2019s exports. With <italic>Texaco</italic>, <italic>Shell</italic>, and other foreign enterprises leaving, <italic>Sonangol</italic> bought their assets and contracted Marc Rich\u2019s <italic>Rich</italic> to provide trading services to steering its crude oil and associated derivatives. By 1976, America\u2019s Secretary of State Henry Kissinger outlined a framework Rhodesia. Fusing Joshua Nkomo\u2019s ZAPU and Robert Mugabe\u2019s ZANU exiled liberation movement factions into the Patriotic Front, the apartheid Front split and Ian Smith dissolved Parliament in 1977, with a call for general elections. As ZANU-PF Robert won the election, Mugabe became PM of the newly renamed Zimbabwe.\nWhile Mobutu\u2019s Zaire thrived thanks to the high world price of copper, deflation after 1973 led him to nationalize foreign businesses in the mid-1970s amidst mass suffering. As the <italic>Paris Club </italic>was for government guarantees, Zaire\u2019s 1976 crisis led bankers to create the <italic>London Club</italic> for bank loans. After Zaire granted decision-making powers to an IMF-sponsored team, the team leader\u2019s early departure damaged the legitimacy of the Western-friendly government. As Communist rebellions spread by 1977, France and America supported Mobutu. In return, Mobutu backed rebels against Angola\u2019s Communist regime, receiving substantial financial aid from America and France and massive <italic>BANK</italic> loans.\nBy 1979, Mobutu hired <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris (with Zarb), <italic>Lehman Kuhn </italic>(with Ball and Samuels), and <italic>Warburg Paribas</italic>. Since an advisor haggled over specific words, advisors then tended to stay out of the negotiating room. As Neto died in late 1979, MPLA member Jos\u00e9 Santos dominated Angolan politics for decades. After nationalizing the European diamond monopoly in 1981, Santos opened a subsidiary in London to handle the trading of oil and its derivatives as <italic>Sonangol</italic>\u2019s contract with <italic>Rich</italic> expired by 1983. But as PU prices grew after the <italic>Panic of 1979</italic>, South Africa investigated ESCOM in 1983.\nWhile Chile nationalized copper under the continent\u2019s first Marxist in 1971, she tapped Western banks to modernize oil-dependent smelting and double production after a CIA-financed military coup. After Chile guaranteed bank debt in 1981, they had to devalue her <italic>peso</italic> in 1982. The same year, Chile privatized bankruptcy\u2014along the lines of America\u2019s BA1978\u2014and electricity\u2014like PA1978, to add generation competition for industrials. \nAs <italic>Rothschild</italic> privatized Chile\u2019s electricity, Spain\u2019s oil, Singapore\u2019s water, Jamaica\u2019s national bank, and Turkey\u2019s paper<italic>, Kleinwort Benson</italic> did so for <italic>British Aerospace</italic>, <italic>Cable & Wireless</italic>, <italic>Enterprise Oil</italic>, and <italic>British Telecom </italic>in the 1980s.<italic> </italic>British Minister Thatcher hired <italic>Lazard</italic>\u2019s MacGregor, a Scot, to accelerate de-industrialization and reorg coal-based industries for privatization in 1980, Felix Rohatyn<italic> </italic>sought to declare Poland bankrupt and suspend new financing in 1982. \nLike Argentina and Brazil allowed nationalized PUs profits to fall, Mexico chose between riots when passing on inflation and stabilizing prices by borrowing from Western banks using oil collateral. After the <italic>Panic of 1973</italic>, Mexico lowered tariffs to fight inflation. As America refused to buy Mexican gas in 1977, her treasury operated at a deficit by 1980, and so Mexico slashed tariffs in 1981. Like France in 1982, Mexico\u2019s departing president nationalized banks and defaulted on her debt. \nAs Mexico faced a severe balance of payments crisis due to rising interest rates and declining oil revenues. Mexican Secretary of Finance visited Washington in August 1982 to confirm Mexico\u2019s depleted reserves and the possibility of a public announcement of default. Over that weekend, UST arranged a $2 billion rescue package. FRS organized an additional $1.85 billion loan, with contributions from UST\u2019s <italic>Exchange Stabilization Fund</italic>, and other central banks through BIS while negotiations with IMF were ongoing. By yearend, IMF agreed to form an Extended Fund Facility worth $3.7 billion. \nAmerica contributed $3.625 billion, which included contributions to the FRS rescue package, and swaps extended by FRS. While UST\u2019s <italic>Credit Commodity Corp</italic> loaned a $1 billion for future American corn purchases by Mexico, while <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserve</italic> loaned a $1 billion for advance payment for Mexican oil sales. Other industrialized nations provided $925 million through BIS. These loans had a one-year maturity and were repaid in 1983. \nSince FA1933 banned securities, banks participated in bank loans. While participating in Mexico\u2019s debt restructuring,<italic> Citi</italic> was sued by <italic>Michigan</italic> NB over a disputed <italic>Pemex</italic> state oil loan. To avoid a Paris Club precedent, Mexico rescheduled her debt through OECD in 1983. After <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Rodney Wagner arranged a bond issue to refinance Mexican debt in 1984, UST Secretary James Baker adopted the process to support restructuring through increased <italic>BANK</italic> lending. However, IMF aid entailed devaluation, privatization, and liberalization. Crippled by Latin American debt defaults, Britain\u2019s <italic>Lloyd</italic> bank retreated from sovereign debt for low-risk LICs and private banking.\nSince Nigeria withdrew all deposits from <italic>Barclay</italic> in protest of the bank\u2019s support for apartheid policies in 1978, <italic>Barclay</italic> Chair Anthony Tuke had made the bank the world\u2019s most profitable, but resigned and became Chair of <italic>Rio Tinto</italic>, continuing to mine in South African dominated Namibia. Although British Africa had prohibited artisanal mining, the credit death and surge in gold prices led Tanzania and other former colonies to lift the ban on independent mining in 1979, leading to rapid discoveries. While <italic>DeBeers</italic> stabilized Sub-Saharan incomes, African free mining and GE and the Soviets flooded the market with synthetic diamonds by 1980, ending her monopoly. \nBy 1982, South African permitted Black trade unions, including the <italic>National Union of Mineworkers</italic>. In June 1983, NUM secured wage increases for 6,000 employees on 41 gold mines. While remaining an <italic>Anti-Apartheid Movement</italic> executive, Ethel Katz became the director of <italic>British Defense & Aid Fund for Southern Africa</italic> by 1981, establishing a trust to train South African and Namibian exiles in Britain to contribute to democratic governance upon liberation. As BCCI broke British <italic>Barclay</italic> and <italic>Standard</italic> duopoly in Botswana, acted as Swaziland\u2019s central bank, and was one of the few Zimbabwe allowed. Having nationalized oil and banks by 1971, Nigeria\u2019s military turned to BCCI over IMF. \nWhile oil-rich shareholders had limited liability, BCCI paid bribes for Third World central bank deposits, exclusive handling of a country\u2019s use of US commodity credits, and preferential treatment on the processing of money coming in and out of the country. Instead of recognizing losses, they bribed auditors and regulators for forbearance<italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>As African debt default soared as droughts in the early 1980s stunted agriculture and hydroelectricity. So, Egypt used <italic>Aswan Dam</italic> water reserves, Ghana eliminated price control subsidies, and Zimbabwe developed coal with<italic> BANK </italic>aid. \nThe drought of the Nile Valley also spurred religious tensions. After <italic>Sassoon</italic> and <italic>Cattaui </italic>created <italic>Bank of Cairo</italic> shortly before Nasser nationalized it in 1952, they partnered again in the 1970s and Solomon Menasche Sassoon married Josephine Cattaui in 1971. As Egypt became more market oriented and the Sudan gave autonomy to the non-Muslim South Sudan, Ethiopia continued to tolerate the Falasha\u2014Black Jews\u2014as the royalty claimed descent from King Solomon, antisemitism roared after a coup overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974. By 1975, Israel decided that the Falasha had the right to emigrate according to the religious \u2018law of return.\u2019 However, migration remained insignificant. \nAs antisemitism accelerated with droughts from 1980, Falasha and other Ethiopians fled to the Sudan. With the influx of migrants and their own drought, Sudan was unable to service foreign debt and pay crony capitalist military officers at the same time. In 1983, President Nimeiri repartitioned the South, and imposed Sharia law nationwide, which soon escalated into a full-scale civil war. While Nimeiri allowed American and Israeli forces to airlift the famished Falasha, Solomon Sassoon participated as a doctor, he was captured and killed as an alleged spy. Amidst Nimeiri\u2019s shifting political allegiances and maneuvers led to his removal from power by the military in 1985, followed by the election of Ahmed Mirghani.\nWhile Mali sought to stabilize by joining fellow Francophone agricultural-based economies in the <italic>West African Monetary Union</italic> in 1984, Ivory Coast and fellow members tried to diversify, but cocoa and coffee remained primary exports. As oil prices crashed in 1985, African exporter defaults spiked without drought amidst falling commodity prices in 1986. Although Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro called for a debtor\u2019s cartel in 1982, BCCI\u2019s Abedi called for an inter-national private-public <italic>Third World Bank</italic> in 1983. By 1985, <italic>Deutsche</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Herrhausen advocated a <italic>Third World</italic> debt pardon, but American bankers resisted. Within two years, most came around to conditional debt forgiveness. Meanwhile, Hong Kong offered an entry point into China. In 1978, BCCI bought <italic>Swiss Bank Corp</italic>\u2019s Hong Kong branch to bank CCP.\nSince TA1986, <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic>\u2019s <italic>MINERAL</italic> sold South Africa mining to the affiliated <italic>DeBeers</italic> to expand into American mining in 1986. That year, South Africa declared a state of emergency, adversely affected the mining unions, and after the 1987 mine-workers strikes, management dismissed 50,000 workers and selectively hired non-union members, leading to a decline in the <italic>National Union of Mineworkers</italic>. From 1987, <italic>Anglo-American</italic> <italic>Corp</italic> and other mining groups reduced reliance on migrant labor replacing migrant workers\u2019 hostels with low-cost family accommodations. Despite these efforts, <italic>Anglo-American</italic> <italic>Corp</italic> faced criticism for not raising wages to expand workers\u2019 housing choices. Investigating price hikes since 1982, South Africa rechartered 1922\u2019s ESCOM as Afrikaans ESKOM, refocusing from public interest to consumer needs from 1987. In 1988, the government\u2019s labor proposals threatened organized labor, but after amendments in 1990, it was a victory for Black trade unions amid a wave of violence in the country.\nWhile Soviet, Pan-African, and Islamist forces continued to focus on artificial Black and White social constructs, genetics painted a different. Under the Out of Africa model of human evolution, Black populations have more genetic diversity than all others. This is because Africa, as the original homeland of modern humans, has had more time for genetic variations to accumulate. In contrast, Eurasian populations, descending from a smaller founding group, have less genetic diversity due to a population bottleneck and subsequent expansion. \nAs endogamy within Africa preserved this genetic diversity, ancient socio-cultural differences and the legacies of imperialism have influenced attitudes towards foreigners, contributing to xenophobic exclusion. Since the decolonization of the 1960s, economic factors have driven anti-foreigner sentiments in various African countries, including Ghana, Nigeria, Angola, Uganda, and South Africa. In Chad and Kenya, the war on terror has exacerbated xenophobia, while political and economic issues have led to expulsions in Ivory Coast, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. Concerns about crime have triggered hostility in Tanzania, Burundi, and Congo-Brazzaville, and political reasons have resulted in the expulsion of Angolans from Congo-Kinshasa.\nInstead, African leaders filled key positions with members of their own ethnic or religious groups, including Cameroon\u2019s Paul Biya with Beti and Bamileke, so did Liberia\u2019s Samuel Doe with Krahn, Congo\u2019s Mobutu Sese Seko with Gbande, Kenya\u2019s Daniel Moi with Kalenjin, Somalia\u2019s Siad Barre with Marehan, Malawi\u2019s Hastings Banda with Chiwe, Nigeria\u2019s Ibrahim Babangida with Muslims, Ghana\u2019s Jerry Rawlings with Ewe, and Togo\u2019s Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma with Kabye. \nHolding offices for decades, many relied on foreign weaponry to hold onto power. In 1984, Biya imposed political controls in Cameroon after a failed coup, suspending parties and detaining opponents. In 1988, Biya launched an anti-corruption campaign that led to 115 arrests without reducing graft. Three years later, his forces killed 58 students and detained over 200 during university protests as France shipped nine million rounds of ammunition. In 1990, Ivory Coast\u2019s F\u00e9lix Houphouet-Boigny requested French military help against demonstrations, which was denied. And in 1991, France again declined Togo\u2019s PM Joseph Koffigoh\u2019s request for aid after troops loyal to President Eyad\u00e9ma attacked his residence.\nIn 1969, Ghana\u2019s new PM Kofi Busia required illegal foreigners to obtain work permits or leave. This policy led to the expulsion of between 20,000 and 500,000 Nigerians within three months.  In 1978, Gabon expelled approximately 9,000 Beninese following accusations from Benin\u2019s President Mathieu K\u00e9r\u00e9kou that Gabonese officials attempted a coup against him. In 1983, Nigeria expelled over 2 million foreigners, including more than 1 million Ghanaians, due to economic difficulties. Another expulsion of about 300,000 Ghanaians occurred in 1985.  \nSince Rwanda overthrew the Tutsi King in 1961, an unsuccessful Hutu revolt occurred in Burundi in 1972. Within a year, Hutus Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and his wife Agathe Kanzinga orchestrated a coup to become Rwanda\u2019s president. Together they formed <italic>Akazu</italic>, a politically powerful circle. <italic>Akazu</italic>\u2019s influence extended to key financial positions. Agathe\u2019s brother managed FX at <italic>Rwandan National Bank</italic>, hiding FX deductions under \u2018errors and omissions.\u2019 By 1986 coffee and tin prices, Rwanda\u2019s main exports, plummeted, depriving the country of capital. While France and Belgium rewarded Habyarimana with a new presidential plane, a military pact, and advisors, the economic downturn was especially acute in the countryside and helped to generate a famine in 1989. \nBy 1990 over a million Tutsi refugees and their descendants remained outside of Rwanda, with hundreds of thousands residing in refugee camps in neighboring Uganda. Along with other refugees, Paul Kagame, descended from the deposed Rwandan Tutsi royalty, founding <italic>Rwandan Patriotic Front</italic> (\u201cRPF\u201d) to find a home for Tutsis free of discrimination. Believing they would gain a permanent home in Uganda, RPF supported Yoweri Museveni in overthrowing Ugandan president Milton Obote in 1986. \nWhile Museveni denied them citizenship to shore up his support in Uganda, he supported RPF\u2019s invasion of Rwanda in 1990 to allow Tutsi refugees to return to Rwanda, starting the <italic>Rwandan Civil War</italic>. In response, the French military funded the Rwandan government. By 1991, RPF gained control of a northern border region. The conflict spread into Zaire, where the original inhabitants battled descendants of migrants. Amidst these challenges, <italic>Akazu</italic> organized <italic>Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Libre des Mille Collines</italic>. As Habyarimana and RPF negotiated in 1992, <italic>Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision </italic>disseminated hate speech and incited violence against Tutsis and political rivals.\nAs CCC ECGD loans to Egypt, Iraq, Korea, Morocco, and Algeria grew, Iraq deregulated food prices and dissolved unions in 1989. As inflation and unemployment soared, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Since Iraqi Ahmad Chalabi fled Jordan in the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic> and obtained British citizenship, he founded and chaired <italic>Iraqi National Congress</italic> and led the opposition from 1991. In 1995, he attempted an uprising with CIA in Iraqi Kurdistan but was forced to return to America, where he continued to lead <italic>Iraqi National Congress</italic><italic> </italic>and advice America.\nWhile the Soviet Union joined America and the international community in the <italic>Gulf War</italic>, domestic and international oil stockpiles established following the 1973 embargo mitigated supply disruptions in America, resulting in oil prices remaining 30% above prewar levels into 1992. Without such oil reserves, India\u2019s FX reserves dwindled to less than a month\u2019s worth of imports by June 1991, leading to a sharp decline in industrial production as inflation soared. Following Hussein\u2019s retreat, Congress increased CCC loans to Iraq, which re-licensed private banks for the first time since 1964.\nFollowing over a year of ceasefire, Angola conducted her first multiparty elections in 1992, MPLA\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Santos emerged victorious. As Jonas Savimbi, the opposition leader of <italic>National Union for the Total Independence of Angola</italic> (\u201cUNITA\u201d), alleged fraud, the Angolan Civil War resumed with MPLA and UNITA relying on oil and diamond exports, respectably. \nFollowing drought in 1992, Zimbabwe and her hydroelectricity-dependent neighbors turn to South Africa for coal electricity. As the Black-led <italic>African National Congress</italic> gained power in 1994, they resisted privatizing or financing ESKOM, but used her high credit rating to over-produce energy for export across Southern Africa. \nAfter South Africa\u2019s first democratic elections in 1994, Ethel Katz shifted from training South African and Namibian exiles in Britain to contribute to democratic governance upon liberation to address apartheid\u2019s enduring legacies, including delivering healthcare in rural South Africa until her death. As Vernon Jordan introduced Black Americans to<italic> McKinsey </italic>to help sell<italic> </italic>American services to South Africa, CSFB municipals banker Ron Gault started a recruitment program for CSFB until 1993, when he resigned to head <italic>Morgan </italic>urban finance until becoming <italic>Morgan </italic>South Africa\u2019s first CEO.\nBy 1990, <italic>BANK</italic> calls for reform and pro-Democracy protests tested long-time dictator Mobutu Sese Seko grip on Zaire. Similarly, Burundi\u2019s democratic election led Melchior Ndadaye to become the country\u2019s first Hutu President in June 1993, the RPF-Rwanda war ended in August with an internationally sponsored peace agreement. By October, a military coup killed Ndadaye, plunging Burundi into civil war with violence against Tutsi. As moderate Tutsi banker Sylvie Kinigi became interim president, she quelled the turmoil until Cyprion Ntaryamira took over in February 1994. As Ntaryamira negotiated with Habyarimana, the plane carrying both presidents was shot down in April. This incident significantly heightened tensions within Burundi and Rwanda, leading to genocide of Tutsi and moderate Hutus with agitation from <italic>Radio T\u00e9l\u00e9vision</italic>. \nBy 1996, Tutsis regained control of Rwanda under Kagame\u2019s RPF as Tutsis remained in Burundi. While some soldiers were arrested, tried, and condemned for common crimes like theft-related murder and bar shootings while intoxicated, but they were low-ranking, much like their victims. The murders of prominent officials were not punished, including Prefect Pierre-Claver Rwangabo (killed by his bodyguards), businessman Gervais Birekeraho (kidnapped and found dead nine days later), Fran\u00e7ois Munyantwali (a high-ranking <italic>BANK</italic> official in Kigali), and banker Aloys Karasankwavu (former Deputy Managing Director for <italic>Commercial Bank of Rwanda</italic>), were arrested and beaten by soldiers, leading to their deaths on the way to the hospital. Aloys Karasankwavu, who had recently overseen the launch of <italic>Bank of Commerce, Development, & Industry</italic> and was set to lead it, succumbed to this mistreatment. Important wrongdoers seldom faced real consequences, and when they did, the sentences were merely symbolic. \nWhile Zaire\u2019s Mobutu Sese Seko gave refuge to Rwandan guerrillas, RPF and Congolese ally Laurent Kabila, supported by America, invaded Congo in 1996, battling Mobutu\u2019s forces and Serbian mercenaries. Before Mobutu fled the country in 1997, he cremated Habyarimana\u2019s remains in a last defiant act. As Kabila renamed Zaire the Democratic Republic of Congo, Mobutu succumbed to prostate cancer months later in Morocco. However, facts surrounding the 1994 plane crash remained elusive. \nFollowing the crash, allegations surfaced against <italic>Akazu</italic> member Agathe Habyarimana. Escorted from Rwanda by French troops, questions emerged about collaboration between the French and the Habyarimana regime. By 1996, Agathe settled in Kenya with support from leaders like Mobutu Sese Seko and Daniel arap Moi. In 2006, a French judge alleged that Kagame ordered the plane crash, straining diplomatic ties with Rwanda. Although Agathe was arrested in Paris on charges of war crimes in 2011, she was released on bail and remained free in France in 2011.\nMeanwhile, Mugabe\u2019s Zimbabwe followed another path. In 1990, a group of Black businessmen formed <italic>Indigenous Business Development Centre</italic> to expand the number of Black entrepreneurs through state-supported corporate investment. After entertainment entrepreneur and Mugabe\u2019s distant cousin Philip Chiyangwa secured business deals using his political connections, blackmail, and other coercive tactics, he co-founded a radical alternative in the form of <italic>Affirmative Action Group </italic>in 1994, advocating for the seizure of White assets and equities in existing companies. Using government media, Chiyangwa criticized Mugabe\u2019s political opponents and spread his aggressive messages. \nA prominent example of the Mugabe family\u2019s oppression targeted Enoch Dumbutshena, Zimbabwe\u2019s first black Chief Justice. After leaving the Court in 1990, Dumbutshena ventured into politics before suffering an electoral defeat. Subsequently, in 1995, the government-owned <italic>Zimbank</italic> demanded repayment of loans and repossessed Dumbutshena\u2019s farm. After most of his properties were auctioned to settle his debts, Dumbutshena died of liver cancer nearly destitute by 2000.\nDuring this period, Zimbabwe received approximately $500 million in development aid and enjoyed increased trade with America. In 1994, President Mugabe made an official state visit to Washington. However, relations deteriorated due to Mugabe\u2019s controversial land reform policies in 1997, which involved the seizure of White-owned farms and led to food riots in 1998. Zimbabwe\u2019s military involvement in the Congo further strained relations with America, Rwanda, and Uganda. While Head of South Africa\u2019s ANC Nelson Mandela called Mugabe a tyrant, ANC\u2019s Populist wing and other radical groups called for similar policies in South Africa.\nAlong with funding ANC in 1994, Malaysia\u2019s PM Mahathir Mohamad advocated for \u201cSouth-South\u201d camaraderie like BCCI, while funding a PU in Tanzania and another Malaysian company developed one in Kenya. Like Kenya, Ghana privatized electricity for wholesale competition, while Zimbabwe\u2019s monopoly tapped public markets like Malaysia. Mugabe employed crony capitalism along his family and political allies. \nIn 1996, Zimbabwe privatized the Hwange power plant by signing a contract with <italic>YTL</italic>, with directors including Mohamad\u2019s son. Although several bidders had more experience and offered better terms, <italic>YTL</italic> paid commissions into offshore bank accounts. As <italic>BANK</italic> refused to support the project, <italic>YTL </italic>won the bid. As PU monopoly ZESA\u2019s board criticized the agreement, Mugabe excluded them from negotiations, and subsequently dismissed them. He then installed his brother-in-law as Chair and CEO of ZESA.\nLikewise, members of Mugabe\u2019s party cabinet actively involved in business, including retired General Solomon Mujuru and Roger Boka. Despite his lack of banking experience, Boka received a banking license for <italic>United Merchant Bank</italic>, which granted substantial loans to eleven other companies under his control. Boka\u2019s downfall in April 1998 was marked by the bankruptcy of his commercial bank, allegations of trading fake government-owned CP, and the illegal transfer of $21 million from depositors\u2019 funds to offshore personal accounts. \nDespite these allegations, Boka was never prosecuted, and he received a state funeral in 1999. Also in 1999, <italic>Affirmative Action Group</italic>\u2019s Chiyangwa received substantial support from state-owned and indigenous banks, enabling him to partake in various business ventures, including collaborations with notable figures like the late VP Muzenda and White millionaire and arms dealer John Bredenkamp.  \nPresident Mugabe exercised substantial control over the allocation of public tenders and contracts, with specific instances of his inner circle directly benefiting. In 1995, Mugabe controversially utilized his discretionary authority to overturn a contract decision, ultimately awarding the contract for the construction of the new international terminal at Harare airport to Cyprus-based <italic>Air Harbour Technologies</italic>, owned by the son of the Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Yamani and represented in Zimbabwe by Leo Mugabe. \nIn 1999, Yamani substantiated corruption claims by listing commissions paid to certain Cabinet ministers, including Mnangagwa and Mugabe, totaling $3 million. This scandal resulted in parliamentary resistance in 1997 when MPs initially refused to approve a commercial loan for the project. Despite documented delays and inflated costs, the airport terminal officially opened in 2000, coinciding with a national crisis that undermined Zimbabwe\u2019s reputation as a tourist destination.\nHistorically, Zimbabwe had experienced localized incidents of landless peasants squatting on farmland, often resulting in police-led evictions. However, the farm invasions of 2000 were nationwide, orchestrated coordination by various government entities such as War Veterans, police, and intelligence officers, and notable coverage in state-controlled media outlets. Notably, Cabinet ministers openly endorsed and sponsored these invasions, while a covert committee of President Mugabe\u2019s advisors planned them. Furthermore, the government not only condoned the violence against white farmers but also falsely attributed the provocation to them, despite compelling evidence to the contrary. Regrettably, these events saw an alarming increase in cold-blooded murders.\nIn 2001, America\u2019s Congress unanimously passed the Zimbabwe Democracy & Economic Recovery Bill, resulting in targeted sanctions on ZANU-PF leaders. New legislation, the <italic>Public Order & Security Act</italic> (\u201cPOSA\u201d), enacted in early 2002, criminalized certain speech acts, such as \u2018false statements prejudicial to the state\u2019 and insulting the president. Journalists faced harassment, arrests, and physical beatings under POSA, aiming to intimidate them into self-censorship. After President Mugabe\u2019s relative Gideon Gono bought in the <italic>Financial Gazette</italic> that year, Mugabe made him Governor of <italic>Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe</italic> in 2003. \nZimbabwe\u2019s government also witnessed a growing military presence. During the elections in those years, service army officers oversaw ballot administration and result tabulation. Additionally, retired military officers were appointed to key government positions, including <italic>National Oil Co of Zimbabwe</italic> and <italic>Grain Marketing Board</italic>. \nThe period also saw the infamous \u2018<italic>Operation Murambatsvina</italic>\u2019 from May to July 2005, as military officers led Inter-ministerial Committees in major towns and provinces, violating human rights. In late 2005, Zimbabwe initiated \u2018<italic>Operation Eat Well</italic>\u2019 to combat food shortages by involving the military in farming. Farmers were forced to grow maize for <italic>Grain Marketing Board</italic>, their vegetable gardens destroyed, and they worked without food. While the soldiers used excessive force, brutalizing villagers, the operation did not boost agricultural output.\nIn late 2005, President George Bush Jr expanded sanctions, targeting 128 individuals and 33 institutions, including <italic>Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe</italic>\u2019s governor. By 2006, Governor of <italic>Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe</italic> Gono devalued the <italic>Zimbabwe dollar</italic> by a thousand. Despite this effort, hyperinflation continued to spiral. After the introduction of larger denominations in 2008 failed to stem price growth, devalued again in early 2009, resulting in the collapse of the <italic>Zimbabwe dollar</italic> in under two years. \nThis economic crisis forced an increasing number of transactions to occur in foreign currencies, particularly the <italic>South African</italic> <italic>rand</italic> and <italic>American</italic> <italic>dollars</italic>, pushing the economy further into barter and other informal activities. Subsequently, in spring 2009, the Minister of Finance officially declared the <italic>Zimbabwe dollar</italic> as no longer legal tender, and an acting Minister of Finance recommended the adoption of the <italic>South African rand</italic> as the country\u2019s official currency.\nSince his Greek Catholic family fled Turk Lebanon in 1902, they grew <italic>Helu</italic> general stores in Mexico City. After gaining turn around experience from the late 1960s, Carlos Helu bought more in the <italic>Panic of 1982</italic>. When Mexico began re-privatizing banks in 1987, Harp Helu, Carlos\u2019 cousin, gained control of <italic>Banamex</italic> by 1991, then largest financial group in Latin America. By 1992, Mexico allowed foreign investment and joined a customs union with America and Canada (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). \nDuring the NAFTA vote in 1993, arrangements were discreetly made for potential financial support from America, Canada, and European central banks for Mexico. However, from February 1994, FRS raised interest rates for the first time since the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>. By March, following the assassination of PRI Candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, UST and FRS set up a $6 billion swap line to stabilize the <italic>peso</italic>. In April 1994, the three NAFTA countries signed NAFA, making permanent the $6 billion contribution from America to a swap arrangement with Mexico and Canada. \nAs UST bond yields grew, Russia\u2019s <italic>ruble</italic> fell 20% against the <italic>dollar</italic> in October. After Mexico devalued her <italic>peso </italic>in December, it became evident that Congress would not approve the loan guarantee in January 1995, President Clinton announced a $20 billion loan guarantee package through UST\u2019s <italic>Exchange Stabilization Fund</italic>. In February 1995, a $20 billion assistance package was implemented, including short-term and medium-term swaps and guarantees, with America disbursing $13 billion. \nIn Mexico, President Salinas dealt with the uprising in Chiapas, the assassination of PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo, and the kidnapping of Harp Helu. Although the Helu family paid a reported $30 M after a gang held Harp for ransom for 104 days in 1994, the family soon earned enough to cover that. While Brazil\u2019s military government stepped down after 1985, the president froze bank accounts before impeachment led to a power change and privatization from 1994. As <italic>Safra</italic> bought a phone network, hydro-electricity stalled. \nLike America, Brazil broke-up monopolies before privatization, but <italic>McKinsey</italic>-advised Mexican President Salinas sold SOEs intact, including <italic>Telmex</italic> telephony to <italic>Helu.</italic><italic> </italic>While Mexico created a SOE for non-performing banks in 1995, they did not sell or reorg any until before a new 1998 law. By then, after over 65 years of rule, Mexico\u2019s PRI party lost congressional control. \nAs <italic>Helu</italic> spun of <italic>Telmex</italic>\u2019s wireless business, he topped market leader <italic>Iusacell</italic>, controlled by Ricardo Salinas Pliego, President Salinas\u2019 extended cousin-in-law. By 2002, Pliego formed <italic>Banco Azteca</italic>, the first Mexican-owned bank chartered since 1994. Named after Pliego\u2019s television company and starting within his electronics stores, <italic>Banco Azteca</italic> soon developed branches across Mexico in competition with BBVA <italic>Bancomer</italic> and spread into Peru and Brazil.\nArgentina privatized gas to supply Chile in 1994, but the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic> impeded completion. Elsewhere in Latin America, the weather exacerbated the financial conditions after attempts at democratic reforms. After women held central bank chairs in Bolivia, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Guyana, Honduras modernized <italic>Central Bank of Honduras</italic>\u2014removing fiscal agency to reduce politicization\u2014and appointed Victoria Asfura Diaz as Chair by 1998. (Women chaired <italic>Central Bank of Honduras</italic> nearly continuously until 2010s.)\nHowever, <italic>Hurricane Mitch</italic> devastated Honduras in 1998, causing severe damage to agriculture and infrastructure and leading to the collapse of <italic>Banco Corporativo</italic>. The government took measures to stabilize the financial sector, including the introduction of the Temporary Law for Financial Stability and the establishment of a bank deposit guarantee fund.  As Brazilian water PUs and sold untreated water at a lower price, droughts squeezed the PU and hydro-electricity from Chile to Peru. \nEcuador\u2019s banking system collapsed in 1999 after banks issued high-risk loans to political and business associates. Sixteen banks holding 70 percent of national deposits failed, leading to the replacement of the sucre with America\u2019s <italic>dollar</italic>. In 2000, Ecuador was ranked the most corrupt country in Latin America.\nAnd in Nicaragua, since Violet Chamorro peacefully transferred power in 1997, Nicaragua began privatizing banks, telephony, electricity, oil, and other enterprises in 1998. However, Nicaragua experienced a severe banking crisis amidst allegations of fraud from 2000. As multiple large banks collapsed, <italic>Central Bank of Nicaragua</italic> issued debt and guaranteeing deposits up to $1,500. However, auctions of assets were politicized by high fee elite liquidating boards and low recovery rates, while elite banks grew larger. \nWeak oversight and alleged collusion resulted in the misuse of bailouts funds as the president and other high-ranking officials were implicated in embezzlement and money laundering. Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador experienced more bank liquidations in the early 2000s. As Spanish banks invested in Latin America, <italic>Helu</italic> sold <italic>Banamex</italic> to <italic>Citi</italic>. While <italic>BANK</italic> lent to Brazil in 1999, Venezuela increased control over her oil monopoly,<italic> PDVSA</italic>, distributed land to the poor, and nationalized energy. \nWhile Argentina broke the <italic>peso</italic>\u2019s peg and hired <italic>Lazard </italic>in 2001 to reorg debt, energy reforms from 2002, froze electric rates and cut energy exports. By 2004, Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez and the Castro family of Cuba created <italic>Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas</italic> (\u201cALBA\u201d) regional bloc to promote integration between Latin American and Caribbean countries. \nALBA\u2019s membership soon expanded to Ecuador, Bolivia, Dominica, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint-Vincent, and Grenadines, plus Haiti, Surinam, and Saint-Lucia as \u2018special guests.\u2019 As Nicaragua\u2019s corrupt Supreme Electoral Council supported the re-election of long-term dictator Daniel Ortega in 2006, Nicaragua joined ALBA by 2007, securing debt forgiveness from Venezuela. After Venezuela\u2019s PDVSA formed a JV with Nicaragua in 2008 for oil trade, Chavez initiated <italic>Bank of</italic> ALBA in 2009 to eliminate the <italic>dollar</italic>\u2019s \u2018dictatorship\u2019 using a virtual currency, <italic>sucre</italic>.\nIn Africa, meanwhile, since inheriting plantations in Ivory Coast in the 1920s, F\u00e9lix Houphouet-Boigny united Black landowners to oust while colonists and become Africa\u2019s longest serving President from 1960 until his death in 1997. Houphouet-Boigny\u2019s maternal nephew, Tidjane Thiam had attended elite Parisian schools and worked for eight-years at <italic>McKinsey</italic> before returning to Ivory Coast to lead development initiatives from 1993. While Houphouet-Boigny reigned supreme, the country\u2019s capitalist and political class formed out of descendants of Ivorian pre-colonial chiefs and princes who intermarried and partnered in banking, agroindustry, and construction into the 21st century. At the periphery of this system, was the Ouattara family.\nIn the early 18th century, Sekou Ouattara\u2019s coup in Kong, within modern-day Ivory Coast, established the Ouattara Empire, safeguarding the independence of Kong States amidst competition with Ghana\u2019s Ashanti. Since Houphouet-Boigny\u2019s Baoul\u00e9 ancestors were from Ghana, regional boundaries changed, Sekou\u2019s descendant, Alassane Ouattara, was born to a father from Ivory Coast and mother from Burkina Faso. Earning a doctorate from <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania </italic>in 1972, Alassane joined <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> in 1973, and soon became special adviser to Governor Abdoulaye Fadiga. When Burkina Faso\u2019s turn to promote a Vice-Governor in 1982, Houphouet-Boigny negotiated with the head of that government to appoint Alassane.\nSoon after, Alassane Ouattara rose to Governor for two-years before Houphouet-Boigny appointed him PM and Finance Minister of Ivory Coast in 1990. However, as Houphouet-Boigny died in 1993, leadership transitioned to Henry Bedie, with Baoul\u00e9 cocoa planter origins tracing back to Ghana. As legal changes required presidential candidates to have both parents born in Ivory Coast, Alassane left to be IMF Deputy Director General from 1994 to 1997. With a low 0.5% growth rate in <italic>West African Monetary Union</italic> since 1990, <italic>Central</italic> <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> halved the currency in 1994 to fuel exports. \nAlso that year, <italic>West African Monetary Union</italic> transformed into <italic>West African Economic & Monetary Union</italic> to include economic integration. Through reforms, competitiveness improved, and the growth rate surged by 1997, and Guinea-Bissau joined the union. But during Ivory Coast\u2019s government coup in 1999, Thiam fled to France, where he later became a partner at <italic>McKinsey</italic> in 2000. After two years, he left <italic>McKinsey</italic> for the newly formed <italic>Aviva</italic> insurer in Britain. After an Ivorian judge from the ruling party declared Ouattara a non-Ivorian, he was disqualified from running in 2000 and 2005, while surviving a 2003 assassination attempt in between.\nAcross the equator, a ceasefire in Angola followed the end of the Cold War. Conducted her first multiparty elections in 1992, incumbent MPLA representative Santos won another term. As Jonas Savimbi, the opposition leader of <italic>National Union for the Total Independence of Angola</italic> (\u201cUNITA\u201d), alleged fraud, the Angolan Civil War resumed. In 1997, during the war\u2019s waning phase, the government secured control of UNITA\u2019s diamond mines. To manage the mines\u2019 revenue, President Santos established a SOE, which his daughter, Isabel, controlled through an opaque shell company. Reversing a public bidding decree, President Santos granted an exclusive mobile phone service contract to Isabel, also through a shell company. \nIn 2002, Angola\u2019s civil war ended after UNITA\u2019s Savimbi died in a firefight. MPLA pledged to allocate oil and diamond revenues towards rebuilding the war-torn economy. By 2004, China developed Angolan infrastructure in exchange for oil. But rather than foster free markets or reinvest in the economy, Isabel Santos became the continent\u2019s wealthiest woman with investments ranging from Angola\u2019s largest cement maker to a Swiss jeweler. Citing resource theft, Angola expelled around 100,000 Congolese in 2004, and conducted a second mass expulsion of over 160,000 Congolese from 2008. \nAs oil trebled between 2004 and 2007, SOEs\u2014Saudi<italic> Aramco, </italic>Russian<italic> Gazprom, </italic>Chinese <italic>CNPC, </italic>Iranian <italic>NIOC, </italic>Venezuelan<italic> PDVSA, </italic>Brazilian<italic> Petrobras, </italic>Indonesian <italic>Pertamina</italic>, and<italic> </italic>Malaysian<italic> Petronas\u2014</italic>dominated oil. From India to Korea, firms bought coal and oil assets in Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, and Africa. Like other middle-men minorities, Indians dominating African trade faced public riots during shortages. Amidst ESKOM scandalously buying coal from Indian tycoons in a deal organized by <italic>McKinsey</italic>, Southern Africa continued to suffer electricity shortages. As<italic> </italic><italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> retained ESKOM-linked thermal coal operations, they committed to focusing on mining from 2005, while buying back depressed shares. Meanwhile, Nigeria continued subsidizing electricity for the privileged while thieves pillaged oil meant for export.\nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic> collapsed foreign trade, capital flows, and tourism in <italic>West African Economic & Monetary Union</italic>, GDP slowed until food production expanded and Burkina Faso opened a large gold mine in 2010. That year, Ivory Coast removed the electoral requirement that both parents be Ivorian, allowing Ouattara to contest the election of incumbent Laurent Gbagbo. Although Houphouet-Boigny had imprisoned Gbagbo in the 1980s for public protests, Gbagbo refused to concede alleging foreign influence, to trigger civil war against the <italic>United Nations</italic>-backed Ouattara. As GDP fell and inflation soared across<italic> West African Economic & Monetary Union</italic> in 2011, instability arose with coups in Mali and Guinea-Bissau. After months amidst fierce fighting amidst Gbagbo\u2019s death squads, Ouattara removed Gbagbo. Thiam, meanwhile, joined <italic>Prudential Insurance</italic> as CFO in 2008 before a promotion made him the first Black executive to head one of the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>\u2019s hundred largest firms, and <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> soon after. Following his ouster from <italic>Credit </italic><italic>Suisse</italic> after the <italic>Panic of 202</italic><italic>0</italic>, Thiam ran against Outtara again in 2025, but the latter secured a fourth term as Thiam and Ghagbo had been banned.\nMeanwhile, the collusion between political and economic authority was rampant across the (Jewless) Islamic Middle East and North Africa. Since the 1950s, <italic>Masri</italic> was Palestine\u2019s largest employer. After Sabih Masri\u2019s brother Hikmat founded <italic>Palestine Liberation Organization</italic> (\u201cPLO\u201d) in 1964 with Yasser Arafat, his cousins formed <italic>Jordanian</italic> <italic>Vegetable Oils Co</italic> at year later. While Hikmat founded <italic>An-Najah Uni</italic> in Nalbus and held influential positions in Jordan\u2019s government, his nephew Taher joined Jordan\u2019s central bank. Sabih\u2019s cousin Munib established EDGO, one of the region\u2019s first privately owned engineering companies, to support oil and gas industry in the Gulf while working at <italic>Phillip Petroleum</italic>. \nBy 1970, at King Hussein\u2019s request, Munib served as Jordan\u2019s <italic>Minister of Public Works</italic> and building road and water infrastructure. Along with developing the Saudi navy, EDGO supported Western companies as America invested in Gulf-wide naval defense from 1974. Likewise, Sabih\u2019s Saudi-domiciled ASTRA expanded from catering contracts into construction from 1976, and soon fertilizer, telecommunications, and manufacturing prefabricated steel buildings, plastics, irrigation systems, and bedding). Also in 1976, Sabih\u2019s brother Zafer joined Nablus\u2019 Municipal Council after chairing the <italic>Chamber of Commerce</italic>. \nWhile Sabih Masri\u2019s nephew Taher became Jordan\u2019s Foreign Minister in 1984, Israel labeled PLO a terrorist organization, and appointed Sabih\u2019s politically moderate brother Zafer Masri as the mayor of Nablus in 1985. As Zafer encouraged PLO to engage in diplomacy, pro-Syrian Arab Palestinian groups assassinated him months for accommodating Israel and Jordan. Blaming Israel, Arab Palestinian leaders founded <italic>Hamas</italic> in a secret meeting in Hebron in 1986. They included Muhammad Natsheh of Hebron, Jamal Mansour of Nablus, Mahmud Muslih of Ramallah, Jamil Hamami of Jerusalem, Ayman Abu Taha of Gaza, and Sheikhs Ahmed Yassin and Hassan Yousef. \nYassin, later Hamas\u2019 spiritual leader, had deep ties to Gaza, where his son-in-law Said Siam became a prominent leader. Yousef was the son of the imam of Al-Janiya near Ramallah and son-in-law of the founder of Jordan\u2019s <italic>Muslim Brotherhood</italic>. They agreed to initiate civil disobedience against Israeli occupation, laying the groundwork for the First Intifada war against Israel in 1987. While Zafer\u2019s widow smuggled money into the West Bank to support the intifada, Jordan severed administrative ties with the West Bank by 1988.\nAmidst the <italic>Gulf War</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s Rodney Wagner arranged a syndicated loan for Saudi Arabia to cover war costs. Likewise, America contract ASTRA to supply food to her military forces. And as Oman, Qatar, and UAE privatized power and water assets, Munib\u2019s EDGO invested and expanded operations to nearly 30 countries across the Middle East and Africa. As the <italic>Oslo Accords</italic> of 1993 ended the intifada, and formed <italic>Palestinian Authority</italic> (\u201cPA\u201d) under President Arafat invited Munib to be PM as he sought to economic development. Although his brother Taher Masri became Jordan\u2019s PM, Munib instead founded <italic>Palestinian Development & Investment Co</italic> (\u201cPADICO\u201d) in 1993. By 1994, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Omar Aggad founded <italic>Arab Palestinian Investment Co</italic> (\u201cAPIC\u201d). \nRelying on exclusive PA contracts and <italic>BANK</italic> IFC financing, PADICO formed <italic>Palestine Stock Exchange</italic> and virtually monopolized real estate, poultry, tourism, telecom, electricity, electronics, and plastics. Using similar tactics, APIC soon controlled <italic>Palestine Automobile Co</italic>, <italic>Medical Supplies & Services Co</italic>, <italic>Siniora Food Industries Co</italic>, <italic>National Aluminum & Profiles Co</italic>, <italic>Arab Palestinian Shopping </italic><italic>Centers</italic>, <italic>Arab Palestinian Storage & Cooling Co</italic>, <italic>Unipal General Trading Co</italic>, and S<italic>ky Advertising Public Relations & Events</italic>. \nWhile locals called for competition, Munib claimed that only more PADICO could undo Israeli damage, while his nephew Maher became PA\u2019s <italic>Minister of Economy, Trade & Industry</italic> from 1996, and Maher\u2019s brother Taher held senior roles in Jordan\u2019s government. As Munib founded Democrats in America and became Chair of <italic>Welfare Association, </italic>Palestine\u2019s leading NGO, Arafat\u2019s PLO and PA Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi parlayed monopoly profits into terrorism.\nSince assuming control of Hebron in 1995, PA named Muhammad Jabari\u2019s son-in-law, Arif Jabari, Governor. While several of Muhammad\u2019s sons led PLO, distant cousin Ahmad Jabari was a PLO a member before joining <italic>Hamas</italic> in the 1980s. Ahmad soon took the daughter of a high ranking official as his second wife and married his daughter to the son of Salah Shehadeh, who headed <italic>Hamas</italic>\u2019 military wing. As American President Clinton sought to broker a peace deal between Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak in 2000 with Arabas gaining more a fifth of Israel, Arafat refused to yield any land, and launched the second intifada. \nThat year, Ahmad Jabari joined the military wing under the command of his in-law, who was killed by Israel 2 years later and replaced by Muhammad \u201cDeif\u201d Masri. (Deif was a refugee not closely related to the Masri of Nablus). After Deif was wounded in 2006, Ahmad became acting commander. Within months, a roadblock incident resulted in the death of a 14-year-old Jabari family member, leading to a retaliatory raid on a PA police station, causing injuries and abductions. After the Jabari clan ultimately secured a ceasefire, PA admitted responsibility and settled by compensating the deceased boy\u2019s family. Still, <italic>Hamas</italic> seized control of Gaza in 2007. While Israeli forces Ahmad in 2012, PA continued to fight <italic>Hamas</italic> terrorism in Hebron.\nYahya Sinwar took charge of the group in Gaza in 2017. A founding member of <italic>Hamas</italic> during the first Arab Palestinian intifada in 1987, he played a significant role in establishing the Qassam Brigades, <italic>Hamas</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> armed wing, which carried out suicide bombings and rocket attacks on Israeli targets. Sinwar, who policed suspected Israeli spies, was imprisoned in 1988 for killing four Arab Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel. Released in a 2011 prisoner swap along with over a thousand other terrorists for Israeli soldier.\nBy then, Sabih Masri rose to become Deputy Chair of <italic>Arab Bank, </italic>the largest global Arab bank with branches in over 30 countries. While <italic>Arab Bank</italic> invested in Palestine development projects, they avoided funding PA. By 2001, <italic>Hamas</italic> recruited a Masri-cousin to be a suicide bombing at a Jerusalem Sbarro pizza parlor that resulted in 15 deaths and numerous injuries, <italic>Arab Bank</italic> wired $5,316 to his father. \nAs similar terrorists spread in 2002, an Arab-language newspaper ran a full-page advertisement directing the beneficiaries of listed martyrs to head to <italic>Arab Bank</italic> for \u2018humanitarian\u2019 aid. After Yasser Arafat died in 2004, Munib continued to refuse to return to politics. After Mahmoud Abbas became PA President, his son joined APIC in multiple senior positions. While Salam Fayyad became PA PM in 2007 and focused on reforms to encourage investment, PADICO and APIC solidified their tax exemptions from the president outside of the legislative process. \nAgainst Saudi goals, Qatar gave <italic>Hamas</italic> an audience. When the British military withdrew in 1971 and Qatar gained independence, Khalifa Thani overthrew his cousin to become Emir. He allowed the small Qatar to become a client state of the thriving Saudi Arabia. Although <italic>Shell</italic> discovered a natural gas field off Qatar\u2019s shore in 1971, there was little investment from <italic>Qatar Petroleum</italic>. After her first gas JV with <italic>British Petroleum</italic>, <italic>Total</italic>, and <italic>Mitsui</italic> in 1984, <italic>Qatar Petroleum</italic> formed another JV with <italic>Mobil</italic> in 1993. \nA month after <italic>British Broadcasting Corp</italic> (\u201cBBC\u201d) and a Saudi company launched an Arabic-language television station in Qatar by May 1995, Qatari Crown Prince Hamad Thani deposed his father, the Emir, and began rivaling Saudi Arabia. With the closure of BBC\u2019s JV after a year and a half, Emir Hamad launched <italic>Jazeera</italic>. With greater exports of gas, Qatar transformed from a client state into a regional power and <italic>Jazeera</italic> became the most influential news source in the Arab world. With economic and political competition, Saudi Arabia isolated Qatar.\nSaudi influence was not limited to Palestine. Since Lebanese contractor Rafik Hariri began projects in Saudi Arabia, he became insolvent due to soaring raw material costs. However, in 1976, collaborating with Nasser Rashid, he built luxury blocks for the Saudi royal family, yielding profits that cleared his debts and enabled his first private jet purchase. His defining moment was the successful completion of <italic>Massara</italic> <italic>Hotel</italic> in Taif within an incredibly tight deadline, impressing King Khaled and gaining Saudi nationality and more projects. This led him to form <italic>Saudi</italic> <italic>Oger</italic>, which catapulted Hariri to immense wealth by 1982. However, as Lebanon fell deeper into turmoil, Hariri shifted focus to Lebanese politics. \nWith Saudi Arabian support and his influence among the Sunni bourgeoisie, Hariri ended Lebanon\u2019s Civil War with the <italic>Taif Agreement </italic>in 1989. This restructuring reduced the President\u2019s powers, augmented the PM\u2019s authority, and rebalanced the Muslim-Christian ratio in Parliament, and pushed Lebanon towards economic liberalization and global integration. While PM Hariri directed substantial investments to Beirut and Mount Lebanon from 1992, controversies emerged around profit-centric development and property acquisitions below market value. Likewise, Hariri\u2019s ties to Saudi Arabia and Gulf-based businesses primarily aiding Sunni communities while aligning Lebanon\u2019s economic trajectory closely with Gulf Capital and influence.\nAs Lebanon public escalated debt from the late 1990s, PM Rafiq Hariri\u2019s economic reforms froze government wages, terminated automatic increases, introducing a 10% VAT on goods and services, and other reform. Hariri spearheaded intensified privatization efforts by establishing a <italic>Higher Privatization Council</italic> and passing legislation for key sectors such as electricity, telecommunications, and water in 2002. Simultaneously, he aimed to attract foreign investment by enacting laws to remove property ownership restrictions and create a more investor-friendly environment. \nFrom 2002, Gulf capital and power concentrated Lebanese banking, trade, and real estate, leading to a close intertwining of the country\u2019s Sunni political and economic elites. For instance, the large <italic>Bank Audi</italic> was controlled by Hariri\u2019s son, and other individuals with direct ties to former government officials and ruling Arab monarchies in the Gulf. Hariri also appointed the Lebanon\u2019s first woman to government in 2004, Leila Solh, the daughter of first PM Riad Solh, aunt of Saudi Prince Walid Saud, and widow of a former minister. He soon added Raya Haffar Hassan was the first female finance minister and Mona Afeish was a minister of state. By 2005, Leila Solh, Wafaa Hamzeh, (a Shia close to the Speaker of Parliament), and Nayla Moawad (widow of former President Moawad) became the first women appointed to the Cabinet. \nFurthermore, Iran\u2019s funding of Hezbollah developing a Shia bourgeoisie. While France, <italic>BANK</italic>, and IMF began investing, Hezbollah assassinated Hariri in 2005, leading to war with Israel and government resignations, ending Lebanon\u2019s resurgence. As several Hezbollah-led Syrian-allied minsters resigned in late 2006, Pierre Gemayel, a Lebanese cabinet minister from a prominent Christian family and vocal opponent of Syrian influence in Lebanon, was assassinated. While Rafiq Hariri\u2019s sister Bahia was the lone female in the 2008 Cabinet, his son controlled <italic>Bank Audi</italic>.\nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>, Saudi Arabia allowed debt laden PUs to lower subsidies for large users in 2000, included smaller users to share the burden by October. The Saudis soon reformed the financial system. After Jammaz Suhaimi studied degree in Electrical Engineering at <italic>Uni of Washington,</italic> he became the Deputy Director General of <italic>Saudi Industrial Development Fund</italic> in 1982. By 1984, he became Director General for Banking Control of <italic>Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency</italic> (\u201cSAMA\u201d), where he served as Deputy Governor from 1989. \nFollowing the Capital Markets Law of 2002, Suhaimi became Chair and CEO of the SEC-inspired <italic>Saudi Arabia Capital Market Authority</italic> (\u201cCMA\u201d), overseeing the inception of the <italic>Saudi Stock Exchange</italic>. As the number of companies trading increased from 69 to 85 by early 2006, the annual trades jumped from 4 to over 96 million. Amidst market manipulation concerns, CMA imposed a 5% limit on daily price movements, leading the market to fall by 25% amidst a foiled terrorist attack. While Prince Waleed Saud invested in the market, CMA permitted expatriates to buy shares directly outside of mutual funds. Amidst continued losses, King Abdullah Saud replaced Suhaimi in May. Suhaimi became Chair of <italic>Gulf International Bank</italic>.\nSince her father formed <italic>Olayan</italic> and bought stakes in <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic>, and other banks, American-education Lubna Olayan became CEO of <italic>Olayan</italic>. Along with sitting on the boards of <italic>Citi</italic> and other banks, she became the first woman elected to the board of Saudi-listed company, <italic>Saudi Hollandi Bank</italic>, in 2004. Nearby in Kuwait, another Muslim female banker prospered. \nSince one the long established Bahar merchant family led <italic>Kuwait </italic><italic>National Bank</italic>, Abdul Bahar <italic>Commercial Bank of Kuwait</italic>, and <italic>Central Bank of Kuwait</italic> from the 1960s, Bahar also collaborated with other prominent families and the government in establishing <italic>Kuwait Investment Co</italic> in 1961 and other development funds. \nShaikha Bahar became the Middle East\u2019s most senior female banker. Since graduating from <italic>Kuwait Uni</italic>, she serving as Chair of <italic>Watany Bank </italic>of Egypt and Group General Manager of Corporate Banking at <italic>Kuwait</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>from 2003 to 2008. She then held the position of Deputy CEO of <italic>Kuwait</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>from 2008 to 2010 when she continued to take on greater responsibilities.\nSince Zine El Abidine Ben Ali became President of Tunisia in 1987, his extended family gained ownership of over 220 companies, including real estate, finance, telecoms, and industry. The relatives of his wife Leila acquired significant stakes in privatized companies like <italic>Bank</italic><italic> </italic><italic>of</italic><italic> </italic><italic>South</italic> and local <italic>Volkswagen</italic> and <italic>Peugeot</italic> affiliates. \nWhile the wife of Leila\u2019s brother was a member of the central committee of Ben Ali\u2019s political party, the wife of her nephew head of Tunisia\u2019s main employers\u2019 organization. As Ben Ali was elected for a fifth term with 89.28% of the vote in 2009, he prepared for succession. While Leila advocated women\u2019s rights in Tunisia hinted at her becoming the first female President in the Arab world, her son-in-law targeted conservative Tunisians by investing in Islamic banking and the religious <italic>Radio Zitouna</italic>. \nThe pattern of business and politics cronyism continued in Egypt, where Ahmed Ezz, had close ties with Mubarak, extending to the National Democratic Party, and enjoyed exclusive economic privileges. Likewise, the Moroccan royal family dominated the economy, embodied by Minister of Agriculture Aziz Akhanouch, among Morocco\u2019s wealthiest businessmen and owner of a chain of fuel stations.\nHaving chaired <italic>Iraqi National Congress</italic> out of America since 1991, Ahmad Chalabi continued to advice American leadership and provide intelligence, including on weapons of mass destruction. Amidst democratic revolts, Iraq renewed human rights abuses, leading America to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Following Hussein\u2019s overthrow, looters targeted Iraq\u2019s former largest bank <italic>Rafidain</italic>\u2014founded from the Chalabi family\u2019s nationalized bank in 1964\u2014as well as <italic>Rasheed</italic> and <italic>Iraqi Central Bank</italic>. \nAs Chalabi returned to Iraq, he joined the Iraqi Governing Council, served as deputy prime minister and interim oil minister, and was appointed chair of the Higher National De-Baathification Commission.  <italic>Lazard</italic> advised the new regime. The government established <italic>Trade Bank of Iraq</italic> in 2003 and reestablished <italic>Central Bank </italic>in 2004 as thieves withdrew $1 billion in 2003.\nAfter long-time Syrian dictator Hafez Assad died in 2000, his son Bashar succeeded him and secured <italic>Baath Party</italic> approval to open private banks, reversing the nationalization of the 1960s. While he stated that private banks posed a threat to the national economy, private banks began operating in 2003. So, as Bashar\u2019s cousin Rami Makhlouf gained control of Syria\u2019s largest mobile phone network, he also acquired stakes in banks and other sectors Concurrently, however,  Syria opposed America\u2019s invasion of <italic>Baath</italic>-led Iraq in 2003 and interfered in Lebanese politics.\nLike oil-rich Soviet Union and Iraq, former Imperial Turk lands\u2014from Nigeria to Indonesia\u2014subsidized domestic energy into the 2000s. However, these subsidies were regressive taxes on the energy poor. With growing energy inflation, these countries began phasing out broad energy subsidies. As energy inflation spread to crops, America\u2019s EA2005 accelerated food inflation since farmers substituted crops for biofuel. India stabilized domestic prices with disruptive export bans. \nWhile Libya and Iran phased out subsidies after the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>. As food inflated, riots spread across the Indian Ocean, with coal shortages shut down PUs across China in 2008. America could not help since Congress deregulated inter-state fuel trade and processed oil exports from 1978, crude export bans remained, and gas export approvals took years.  \nAs revolutions across the energy-subsidy-reforming oil states and Japan\u2019s nuclear catastrophe hiked oil over gas in 2011, the White House released <italic>Strategic Petroleum Reserves</italic>. Losses since the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic> led China\u2019s <italic>State Grid</italic>\u2014alongside nuclear and renewables\u2014to buy PUs in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Oman, Singapore, the Philippines, and Hong Kong\u2019s HEC\u2014and become the world\u2019s largest public utility and fastest-growing firm. With Western capital in retreat, Chinese oil SOEs expanded into energy-rich Central Asia.\nWith growing gas stocks in Europe during the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, Putin again called Qatar for a gas cartel as gas prices deflated in 2009. While Russian client Syria prohibited Qatar from building pipes to Europe to diversify Russia\u2019s monopoly, Syria signed pacts with Iran to build pipes across Iran, rising food prices again spurred riots\u2014this time across former Turk colonies\u2014and sparking civil war in Syria, pitting Russia against Turkey and the West in 2011. So, Turkey built pipes for Azeri gas into Europe. Unlike Syria and Lebanon, Jordan decreased energy subsidies.\nLike the Arab Cold War of the 1950s, Iranian funded Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood advocated for an Arab-Islamic order. This dynamic is supported by Qatar\u2019s trans-Arab, exemplified by <italic>Jazeera</italic> media outlet, which fostered a Pan-Arab public sphere since 1996. Lebanon\u2019s War of 2006, involving Hezbollah and Israel, exemplifies these dynamics, reflecting the relationship between state actors like Lebanon, Israel, and Iran and non-statist groups like Hezbollah. Alongside Turkey, Qatar\u2019s <italic>Jazeera</italic> supported anti-establishment movements to challenge Saudi Arabian and American influence. From financially and logistically supporting opposition forces in Syria and Libya, Qatar and her allies lobbied and contributed to think tanks in America and backed the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and other Islamist factions from Tunisia to the UAE. Spreading a caliphate across the Middle East used terrorism and warfare, anti-Western <italic>Islamic State of Iraq </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Syria</italic> (\u201cISIS\u201d) seized over $400 million from <italic>Iraqi Central Bank</italic> in 2014.\nAs oil deflation pain spread to exporters, <italic>Lazard</italic> restructured two of oil-rich Kazakhstan\u2019s public banks into going concerns in 2009, and Angola\u2019s government secured a $1.4 billion IMF loan, about half the estimated wealth of President Santos\u2019 daughter Isabel. From 2011, BCG <italic>Lisbon</italic> office paid an agent with close ties to the Angolan regime to help obtain business and the economic ministry and<italic> Banco de Angola</italic>. \nBut as oil prices fell in 2014, the government cut her 2015 budget by 25% and depleted FX reserves to import food and fuel, spurring inflation. From 2014 to 2017, government revenues fell by 50%. In 2015, the government awarded development contracts to companies linked to Isabel Santos, including a dam and hydropower station and a new port north of Luanda. These projects were later cancelled amid allegations of overpricing. \nWhile President Santos\u2019 family members held prominent roles within Angola\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and the MPLA ruling political party by then, he appointed his daughter Isabel Santos as CEO of <italic>Sonangol</italic> in 2016. In 2017, Angola elected Jo\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o as president, ending Santos\u2019 38-year rule. As offshore financial leaks exposed Santos\u2019 activities, legal action was taken against Chair of Angola\u2019s sovereign wealth fund Jos\u00e9 Santos for money laundering and fraud, Isabel was dismissed as CEO <italic>Sonangol</italic>. After Isabel\u2019s half-sister called President Louren\u00e7o to resign, she was suspended from MPLA\u2019s ruling council and removed from parliament.\nThe Arab Spring of 2011 protested crony capitalism. By 2010, a member of <italic>Arab Bank</italic>\u2019s founding family resigned as Chair due to disagreement with CEO, Deputy Chair Sabih Masri replaced him. As <italic>Arab Bank</italic> used with banks owned by Lebanon\u2019s Hariri family, Masri took control by 2012. Since PA did not generally tax PADICO and APIC, a shortfall in international aid led PA PM Salam Fayyad to impose austerity on public sector employees in 2012, prompting protests demanding his resignation. \nWhile Fayyad proposed \u2018progressive taxation\u2019 to alleviate financial uncertainties, PADICO and APIC PA forced him to resign and installed Rami Hamdallah of the Masri-funded <italic>An-Najah Uni</italic>. By 2016, PA secretly extended PADICO\u2019s telecom monopoly for another twenty years, sparking protests about revenue losses without public bids and the expensive and poor telecom service. And as an American court found them guilty of aiding terrorists, the Masri-owned <italic>Arab Bank</italic> settled in 2015.\nBut extremist terrorism was a worldwide problem that fueled anger against Muslims. Following attacks by Islamic terrorists <italic>Shabaab</italic> in 2013, Kenya\u2019s government threatened to close the Dadaab refugee camp and arrested about 4,000 Somalis. Since the Syrian Civil War began in 2011, the influx of Muslim refugees has become a major issue in European politics. In Hungary, the 2018 \u201c<italic>Stop Soros</italic>\u201d laws criminalizing aid to asylum seekers led to legal challenges from the EU. \nBy 2021, the EU\u2019s top court ruled these laws violated EU regulations. Meanwhile, Brexit, completed in 2020, was driven partly by immigration concerns, but it also revealed the complexities of EU migration policies. Just as EU refugee rights prevented member countries from deporting even criminal migrants back to Syria, they also prevented deportations to Afghanistan after <italic>Taliban</italic> took over in 2021.\nTo address public concerns, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Muhammad Salman\u2019s anti-corruption efforts consolidated the regime, detaining wealthy princes to signal seriousness in combating corruption within elite circles. To reduce oil dependency, Saudi Arabia hired <italic>McKinsey</italic>, BCG, and <italic>Booz Allen</italic>. <italic>McKinsey</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> work in the kingdom grew from two Saudi projects in 2010 to almost 50 the following year, and then accelerating to almost 600 projects from 2011 to 2016. \nOver this time, <italic>McKinsey</italic> hired at least eight relatives of high-ranking Saudi officials, including two children of the Saudi Energy Minister and Head of the state oil company <italic>Aramco</italic>, one child of the Finance Minister, and one child of the CEO of the government-controlled <italic>Saudi Arabian Mining Co</italic>. By 2017, <italic>McKinsey</italic> bought a politically connected Saudi consultancy. However, their involvement has raised ethical questions due to the Saudi government\u2019s authoritarian actions. Although briefly detaining Sabih Masri in late 2017, he was released within a week.\nOver this time, a new banker rose in Saudi Sarabia. <italic>Gulf International Bank</italic> Chair Jammaz Suhaimi\u2019s daughter Sarah studied accounting at university and became one of the few women in banking by joining <italic>Citi</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> Saudi affiliate, <italic>Saudi American Bank</italic> in the early 2000s before <italic>Citi</italic> exited the country in 2004. In her mid-30s, Sarah was named CEO of <italic>Saudi</italic> <italic>National Commercial Bank </italic>(\u201cSNCB\u201d) <italic>Capital</italic>, the investment banking unit of SNCB in 2014, becoming the first female CEO of a Saudi investment bank. \nWhile she was isolated on a different floor due to the absence of women in her working area, she excelled and become CIO. This success caught the attention of SNCB <italic>Capital</italic>\u2019s Chair, resulting in her recruitment for CEO of <italic>Jadwa Investment</italic> in 2014. By 2015, Jammaz Suhaimi\u2019s vision of opening equity market to foreign investors became a reality. In early 2017, his daughter Sarah became Chair of <italic>Saudi Stock Exchange</italic>, the first woman to do so in the Middle East, as the nation aimed to amplify women\u2019s participation in the economy. After her father died in 2017, she became Trustee of accounting standard setting IFRS <italic>Foundation</italic> by 2019.\nIn Africa meanwhile, following years of subsidizing electricity prices and inadequate investment, South Africa\u2019s publicly owned ESKOM, the largest power producer in Africa, initiated rolling blackouts from 2007 onwards to avert a power grid collapse. These load-shedding measures led to reduced hospital services, heightened food and water scarcity, a surge in bankruptcies, escalating crime rates, and unemployment surpassing 30%. In the face of attempts to shift away from coal to renewable energy sources, the dominant political party ANC shielded criminal cartels that profited from coal and energy theft. \nBeginning in May 2008, South Africa saw xenophobic violence, with attacks on immigrants from Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe, resulting in over 60 deaths and mass displacement. In 2015, violence resumed after Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini blamed foreigners for crime and job losses, which led to further violence and displacement. Scarce water resources also fueled conflict. Since Egypt used <italic>Aswan Dam</italic> water reserves monopolistically during the droughts on the 1980s, Ethiopia began dam construction in 2011. With her water resources threatened, Egypt supported Somalia against Ethiopia. \nLikewise, the surge in gold prices triggered independent African to run to gold mines. Since the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, <italic>West African Economic & Monetary Union</italic> GDP slowed until food production grew and Burkina Faso opened a gold mine in 2010. While gold prices peaked in 2011, ten million artisanal miners in Benin, Burkina Faso, DRC, Sierra Leone, and Tanzania supported 54 million Africans by 2014. \nWhile <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> supported low share prices with stock buybacks before the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, prices plummeted after a liquidity crisis forced her to suspend dividends. While <italic>Anglo-American Co</italic> sold off stakes in Ghana\u2019s <italic>Ashanti</italic>, South Africa gold, and ESKOM-linked thermal coal operations, she controlled <italic>DeBeers</italic>. However, the Oppenheimer family sold their <italic>DeBeers</italic> shares to Botswana. Meanwhile, India\u2019s Sandesara brothers transformed their tea trading into a conglomerate including Nigeria\u2019s crude oil industry. After fleeing Indian accusations of bank fraud in 2017, Sandesara continued to invest in expanding Nigeria oil production. \nAs Daniel Ortega sought to allocate central bank reserves to <italic>Bank of</italic> ALBA in 2012, the central banker resigned. As Ortega consolidated control over Nicaragua\u2019s political and financial realms, Venezuelan oil production suffered from rampant corruption. While Congress sanctioned Iran\u2019s oil sector since the 1980s, they similarly extended the sanctions to trade financing in 2011 and 2013 amidst protests. Likewise, President Obama\u2019s executive order banned Russian and Venezuelan oil from 2014 amidst crack downs on civil protest. By 2017, President Trump\u2019s Congress codified sanctions against Russian oil and sanctioned the corrupt head of Nicaragua\u2019s Supreme Electoral Council, leading to his removal.\nEven as Ortega intensified repression, <italic>Central American Bank for Economic Integration</italic> (\u201cCABEI\u201d)\u2013the Euro-American-funded development bank founded in 1960\u2013provided $2.65 billion in loans to Nicaragua. In 2018, when the Nicaraguan police began a violent crackdown on protesters, CABEI lent $365 million to the country to build police precincts and upgrade their communication systems. In response to COVID, CABEI provided over $1 billion in loans to its member states, including Nicaragua. The bank\u2019s lending peaked at $805 million in 2021, the year Ortega jailed opposition leaders, including presidential candidates. After Trump eliminated Iranian and Venezuelan oil import in 2019, Venezuela imported Iranian oil as domestic oil and electricity production collapsed. So, Latin American refugees continued to flee north into America. \nSince becoming President of Honduras in 2005, political heir Manuel Zelaya joined ALBA. However, a coup ousted and exiled Zelaya in 2009, and America supported. the post-coup election of Porfirio Sosa in 2010, who withdrew from ALBA. Sosa and his successor Juan Hern\u00e1ndez in 2014, promoted multi-national drug cartels. Facilitating the transport of over 400 tons of cocaine to America, Hern\u00e1ndez received bribes from drug traffickers and used his influence to protect them. He employed the national police and military to secure drug shipments, selectively supported the extradition of some traffickers while shielding others. \nIn America, Manuel\u2019s brother Carlos laundered drug funds until his arrest in 2018. By 2021, America sanctioned Hern\u00e1ndez, who was extradited to America the following year. While America supported Honduras\u2019 election of Zelaya\u2019s wife Xiomara as President, who installed her family again in positions of power, including Carlos Zelaya\u2019s son as Defense Minister. Likewise, Honduras rekindled relations with Venezuela and ended the extradition treaty with America. \nSince Qatar and her <italic>Jazeera</italic> media outlet aligned with Turkey, Russia, and Iran, America, UAE, and other the Sunni monarchies supported Saudi Arabia\u2019s blockade of Qatar in 2017 to curtail Qatari influence. As Saudi Arabia supported the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign against the Iranian regime, Tehran attacked Saudi oil infrastructure in September 2019. With the American-led <italic>Abraham Accords</italic> of 2020, UAE and Bahrain agreed to normalize relations with Israel in return for investment. However, both were careful to limit any talk of military cooperation with Israel to avoid provoking Iran. After American forces assassinated Iran\u2019s elite military commander Qasem Soleimani, Soleimani daughter married Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah\u2019s cousin and second-in-command in June 2020.\nHossein Shamkhani, son of Ali Shamkhani\u2014Iran\u2019s longest-serving defense minister and current adviser to the Supreme Leader\u2014founded <italic>Crios Shipping</italic> in Dubai in 2020 to move Iranian missiles, drone parts, and dual-use goods to Russia via the Caspian Sea. In early 2022, he helped establish <italic>Milavous</italic> in Dubai, which expanded to Switzerland and Romania by the end of that year. Through 2024, Milavous traded Iranian and Russian oil and petrochemicals, some of which reached firms including <italic>Sinopec</italic>, <italic>Chevron</italic>, and BP via intermediaries. In mid-2024, America increased scrutiny of Shamkhani and <italic>Milavous</italic> for sanctions violations and imposed banking restrictions, though over 60 vessels linked to Shamkhani remained unsanctioned.\nSaudi Arabia continued to grow closer with Western capitalism. Wassim Khatib joined NCB <italic>Capital</italic> in 2006, he was a middle manager when Sarah Suhaimi became CEO in 2014. Becoming Head of Investment Banking at NCB Capital, Khatib was one of the lead bankers on the 2019 IPO of <italic>Aramco</italic>, the biggest ever, alongside <italic>Saudi American Bank</italic>, <italic>Goldman</italic>, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic>, <italic>Morgan</italic>, HSBC. Re-entering Saudi Arabia, <italic>Citi</italic> appointed Khatib CEO of <italic>Citi</italic> Saudi Arabia by 2021, as <italic>Citi</italic> lent to the Kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund and worked on IPOs on <italic>Saudi Stock Exchange</italic> and <italic>Acwa Power</italic>. As Suhaimi joined the boards of <italic>Saudi Airlines</italic> and <italic>Saudi Telecom</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic> hired her as Chair of <italic>Lazard</italic> MENA in 2022 and soon recruited Khatib as CEO. Celebrating her 175th anniversary in 2023, <italic>Lazard</italic> almost sold herself to Abu Dhabi, which invested in the management buyout of <italic>Fortress</italic>. \nLike fellow emirate Dubai, Abu Dhabi saw an influx of high-net-worth individuals and asset managers from Switzerland, Hong Kong, and New York due to lower taxes and access to the region, including Saudi Arabia, as global governments increased taxes on wealthy residents to address fiscal gaps after COVID. This trend included prominent asset managers like <italic>BlackRock</italic>, PGIM, <italic>Franklin Templeton</italic>, <italic>Fidelity</italic>, and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>. Additionally, family offices, including <italic>Bridgewater</italic>\u2019s Ray Dalio and <italic>Apollo</italic>\u2019s Leon Black, established operations in the UAE. In response to this run to the Emirates, HSBC, <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Chase</italic>, and <italic>Morgan </italic><italic>Stanley</italic> expanded their private banking teams and created dedicated units in the region.\nMeanwhile since the Arab nationalizations and wars against Israel, Jewish populations declined across Israel\u2019s neighbors. Between 1947 and 2019 in Morocco (from 265,000 to 2,100), Algeria (from 140,000 to 200), Tunisia (from 105,000 to 1,000), Libya (from 38,000 to 0), Egypt (from 75,000 to 100), Iraq (from 135,000 to 7), Syria (from 30,000 to 100), Lebanon (from 5,000 to 100), and Yemen (from 63,000 to 50). Likewise, many Christians fled violence and persecution in the Middle East from 2000. \nWhile Iraq\u2019s Christian population fell in half to 3% following the 2003 invasion, tens of thousands of Christians fled the Syrian civil war from 2011. By 2013, Christians in Lebanon accounted for 35% of the population, down from a previous majority. In Egypt, Christians made up about 10% of the population before the election of Mohamed Morsi in 2012, which fueled anti-Christian sentiment as clerics incited violence, resulting in church burnings and attacks. \nIn Israel, however, Muslim Arabs grew to comprise over 20% of the population with full civil rights. Haj Yehia of Tayibe was Israel most prominent Arab tribe. Born to a landowner, Mohammed Yehia was one of the first Arab students at <italic>Tel Aviv Uni</italic>. While one of his sons was a finance attorney in Tayibe and headed <italic>Jordan Gateway Free Zone & Industrial Park</italic>, another headed Scotland\u2019s heart transplant program. A third son accrued five degrees by the age of 30, including an MIT PhD, and served as VP of <italic>Fidelity </italic>in Boston and lectured in <italic>Harvard</italic>. Other relatives included a pharmacology professor in <italic>Uni of South Carolina</italic> and a senior United Nations official. Returning to Tayibe in 2012, Samer resisted political pressures, choosing instead to contribute to the family\u2019s success. In 2019, he became the first Arab Chair of <italic>Bank Leumi</italic>\u2019s Board.\nAgainst Trump-style border walls, <italic>Open Society</italic>, <italic>Tides</italic>, and similar<italic> </italic>Democrat grassroot voting campaigns funded<italic> Adalah Justice Project</italic>, which advocated for the destruction of Israel\u2019s border fence, and <italic>Samidoun</italic>, which fundraised for PLO\u2019s terrorist factions. Similar non-profits sponsored rallies advocating unequivocal support for <italic>Hamas</italic> to eliminate Israel. Since President Trump negotiated the withdrawal agreement with the Taliban in 2020, the chaotic evacuation under President Biden in Kabul in 2021 led to a suicide bomber attack that killed over 100 Afghans and 13 American service members. \nThat year, the Biden administration restructured their National Security staff, downsizing the team focused on the Middle East and strengthening the unit stretching from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. This change reflected concerns about China\u2019s influence and a shift away from the Middle East, previously a central focus of security challenges. By 2022, the Biden Administration relaxed sanctions on Iranian oil trade and blacklists, aiming to reach an accord on Iran\u2019s nuclear program and possibly influence prices. As the Administration unfroze energy payments, Iran financed international proxies for terrorism.\nAs Saudi Arabia moved to normalize relations with Israel in 2023, Iran funded terrorists. An hour after firing thousands of rockets into Israel on October 7th, Gaza President Yahya Sinwar and <italic>Hamas</italic>\u2019 Muhammad Deif masterminded the terrorist attack on 22 Israeli towns across land, sea, and air butchering men, women, and children to spur Israeli retribution instead of dialogue. As Israel sought to end <italic>Hamas</italic>\u2019 rule of Gaza, pro-Palestine protests mobilized globally and in greater numbers than during the Arab Spring. Nor did the progressive protests condemn the extreme sexual violence carried out by <italic>Hamas</italic>, which Sheryl Sandberg convinced UN to detail after initial silence. \nThe Golden Age of American Jewry flailed as elementary and college educators depicted Zionists as colonialists and made Gaza a focal point of the curriculum. Of the $3 billion disbursed for environmental justice grants by the so-called <italic>Inflation Reduction Act </italic>(\u201cTA2022\u201d), <italic>Climate Justice Alliance</italic> received $50 million to coordinate protests advocating for \u201cFree Palestine Is a Climate Justice Issue\u201d and criticizing American support for Israel alongside <italic>Adalah Justice Project</italic>. Not until 2024 did UST and other countries sanction <italic>Samidoun</italic> as a sham charity serving PLO terrorism.\nAs antisemitism swept through ivy leagues, former <italic>Harvard</italic> President Summers and industrialists and financiers ranging from <italic>Apollo</italic> CEO Marc Rowan to Jon Huntsman, the Mormon former governor of Utah, criticized <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic>. After <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> forced Elizabeth Magill, a White woman to resign, <italic>Harvard</italic> refused to do so for Claudine Gay, even as her serial plagiarism was revealed, because her being a Black woman threatened DEI. Ignoring her incompetence, Gay\u2019s supporters labeled detractors as misogynistic racists. As she resigned in 2024, becoming the <italic>Harvard</italic> president with the shortest tenure, she kept her salary.
