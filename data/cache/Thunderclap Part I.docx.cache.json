Congressional acts combine category and year. Holding companies and corporations identified with \u201cHC\u201d. \u201cMM\u201d prefixes identify short-term liquid debt money markets. Names of people are not <italic>italicized</italic>, but <italic>firm</italic> names are and do not use definite articles. Some other institutional proper nouns are also <italic>italicized</italic>. Acronyms are generally not <italic>italicized</italic>. Descendancy is usually direct. Cousinhood is often of the first order, unless a surname, then usually implies several marriages between the surnamed families. Middle names are either maternal or maiden surnames. Some surnames have been changed for differentiation from others (e.g., Smith to Smyth).\n\n\nIntroduction [WIP]\n<italic>Panics</italic>\nThe premise of <italic>Thunderclap</italic> is that to understand financial panics, one needs to examine their historical context. \nThe terminology of panics is imprecise for various reasons. Robert Rubin, reflecting on his experience as Secretary of <italic>United States Treasury </italic>(\u201cUST\u201d) after co-chairing <italic>Goldman Sachs</italic>, said that \u201c<italic>I avoided using words such as </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>panic</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> and </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>meltdown</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>, preferring less vivid terms such as </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>contagion</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> and </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>loss of confidence.</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> I</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>d learned while working in the White House as director of the National Economic Council (NEC) that the words public officials use can make an enormous difference, and that was even truer at the Treasury</italic>.\u201d (). \nIn the foundational work in quantitative economic history,  observe that: \u201c<italic>In much of our literature, the preconceptions about variations in growth rates are obvious in the terminology. 19</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> </italic><italic>century economists spoke of panics and crises. Few people in the </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>30s, however, wrote about the </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>panic of 1929</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>; by then, the profession had learned that it was studying cycles. Since WWII we have changed our focus once again. We are concerned with the problems of development and sustained growth; we tend to look for </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>breakthroughs</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>, </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>takeoffs</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>, and </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>big pushes.</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>\u201d Does this theory imply that \u2018panics\u2019 often occur alongside technological advancements and are of secondary importance to other government objectives? That is probably not the case.\nThere have always been and will always be panics in the financial markets. For example,  chronicles a 33 CE bankruptcy law that collapsed Rome\u2019s money market, which had little to do with technological advance. Panics encompass a range of events, from bank crises to credit crunches, housing busts, and stock market crashes. While the economic cost of panics may increase debt defaults, unemployment, and tax defaults, the impact of economic crises varies. As credit and housing busts can extend recessions, bank panics may destabilize the political order. \nGiven the lack of consensus available immediately on the cause of panics, politicians typically appeal to emotions, rather than facts. The allegories that grow out of panics are the main factors molding political and social systems. It is often easier to blame bankers and politicians. So, voter preferences shift to greater state control after panics. Though production drops are usually short-lived, the cycle of political extremism continues to reshape legislation for a considerably longer period.\nSeveral of the seminal studies exploring the causes and consequences of panics include , , and . These works alternately attribute panics to monetary policy, banker greed, or market irrationality. One reason for this is that information about banks only becomes public and interesting enough for the media during panics.\nBut if bad or irrational business decisions are omnipresent, monetary policy is the central factor of panics for otherwise functional markets. According to Friedman in , \u201c<italic>Inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon.</italic>\u201d And again in , saying \u201c<italic>the political establishment tried to prolong the happy glow by attributing the acceleration of inflation to special events\u2014bad weather, food shortages, labor union intransigence, corporate greed, the OPEC cartel, or any straw at which they could grasp</italic>.\u201d \nWhile monetary policy can contract economies to end inflation, panics often have different root causes. Under the gold standard, for example, central banks increased interest rates to prevent gold outflows following panics. Similarly, policies implemented after the initial panic can either exacerbate the crisis or redirect economic activity. These policy shifts are sensitive to disruption and contribute to a continuous regulatory cycle.\nFor its role in panics, monetary policy holds a unique place in democracy. To prevent political interference, most countries have established a separation between central bank monetary policy and executive government control. Few agencies can challenge the party in power as much as central banks. This differentiates credit from other public interests such as climate, health, and trade. Like coal regions support mining to increase low-skill jobs, high capital and low labor oil and gas investments cut prices. While scientists continue to debate whether hydro-carbons cause climate change or politics manufacture climate emergencies, private energy always competes on the political and social stage. \nWhile there have been numerous books written on the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>, relatively few years have passed compared to when the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic> was covered by , , and . Surprisingly, most of the latter do not discuss law, energy policy, or any demographic or geographic factors. While Wigmore\u2019s study on American securities markets in the four years from 1929 investigated industries, it was only for 6 out of 760 pages. Over six decades after the event, Wicker\u2019s academic work was the first to identify bank failures with just three regions.\nUnfortunately, much of the panic literature focuses on the effects and responses to panics without providing historical or legal context. Part of this has to do with how academia and publishers compartmentalize disciplines, fracturing our understanding of panics and society. But while policymakers use the <italic>law & economics</italic> approach to curb inflationary protectionism, economists often ignore the difficult-to-quantify law. \nMonetary policy seems to clearly have been to blame for the inflation of 1624. Speaking of Habsburg Spanish Emperor Philip IV, ) notes \u201c<italic>In the first five years after his accession, the output was enormous. But, as has almost always happened in similar cases, the resultant monetary disorder was attributed to malfeasance, particularly by foreigners, rather than to defective monetary policy</italic>.\u201d The \u2018foreigners\u2019 were mostly Jews and Protestants, such as the Dutch, who were at war with Spain. \nHowever, investigating economic crises across the Long 17th century,  challenge Earl Hamilton\u2019s monetary policy theory of panics, which centered on silver prices and the inflow of American treasure through Eurasia to Japan. They propose a more comprehensive explanation for the global uprisings, delving into religious, labor, and climate shifts.\nLikewise,  placed American post-WWII panics in relation to fiscal policy. However, he considered energy policy as exogenous to government policy and did not mention a single banker, union, anti-trust action, or minority. Are those factors negligible? <italic>Thunderclap </italic>argues otherwise. \nFurthermore, panic affects various geographies, asset classes, and industries in distinct ways. As ), Mexico\u2019s Minister of Industry & Natural Resources, wrote on the twilight of his country\u2019s sovereign debt default: \u201c<italic>Capital markets work to a large extent by rationing credit, not simply through changes in interest rates in... smooth way[s]... If the debt ratios of a borrower exceed certain maximum limits, the country may not obtain the required finance whatever the level of the interest rate</italic>.\u201d By tracing the impact of regulatory policies through a contextual, historical narrative, <italic>Thunderclap</italic> aims to portray panics in a fuller light.\n<italic>Sociology</italic>\n\u201c<italic>So long as Isaac of York trusted his brother Jacob of Marseilles</italic>\u201d, one historian wrote of Jews of the Middle Ages, \u201c<italic>and both of them trusted their cousin Joseph of Jerusalem, all three stood to make a profit</italic>.\u201d Like nepotism in private transactions, \u201c<italic>crony capitalism</italic>\u201d centralizes informal relationships in government dealings can ensure trust and align long term interests. \nBut like fraudsters can exploit trust for greed or to conceal mistakes, so can politicians label informal arrangements as sinister and corrupt. Corruption is a natural result when panics follow policy actions under political bias. The customary understanding of corruption confines it within strict legal definitions, predominantly associating it with the state and public sectors, failing to recognize its broader entrenchment within cultural norms and its pervasive presence across both public and private domains (). \nAs  argues, economic action is embedded in ongoing social networks, rather than being the product of atomized actors assumed by neoclassical economics. Trust, reciprocity, and reputation within these networks shape behavior, enabling cooperation but also creating potential for exclusion or corruption. Unlike new institutional economics, which treats institutions primarily as efficient solutions to economic problems, Granovetter emphasizes the historical and relational origins of institutions, showing how social structures constrain and direct economic action. \nStudying the Indonesian <italic>Panic of 1997</italic>,  demonstrates that nepotism and corruption are not inherently destabilizing; their impact depends on institutional quality. In strong regulatory and corporate environments, family and ethnic networks reinforced trust, whereas under weak institutions, the same networks could amplify dysfunction. \nIn Japan, a similar interplay between kinship and capitalism persists through the traditional practice of <italic>mukoyoshi</italic>\u2014the adoption of adult sons-in-law into family businesses. For centuries, Japanese conglomerate families have used this system to ensure capable succession and preserve family control. By selecting sons-in-law rather than relying solely on blood heirs, families can prioritize merit and leadership skills while maintaining lineage continuity. Listed Japanese companies led by adopted sons-in-law outperform both those managed by blood heirs and those run by unrelated executive between 1962 and 2000. Such nepotism functions less as favoritism than as a market mechanism to prevent dynastic stagnation\u2014illustrating how family capitalism, when socially embedded and performance-driven, can enhance rather than undermine efficiency.\nElites play a significant role in policy making. Traditional perspectives often portray society as a hierarchical pyramid, presenting a straightforward structure with elites perched at the summit and the general populace relegated to the base. This oversimplification disregards the intricate interplay and dynamic nature of social relationships and networks (). \nAs such relationships are often familial, conventional views similarly cast nepotism in a uniformly negative light, neglecting to acknowledge potential variations between beneficial and detrimental instances (). Indeed, Bellow emphasizes the continued prevalence in America of familial traditions and nepotism across different societal spheres such as the military, religious institutions, and labor unions.\nUnlike the entertainment industry, where celebrities are widely recognized, few voters can readily name current or historical minority bankers and industrialists. \u201c<italic>As Ferguson [</italic><italic>] warns in his introduction, it is hard to write about bankers and financiers. For all their importance, what they do on a day-to-day basis is rarely good raw material for drama except, of course, during crises like the one we have just lived through\u2014and nothing dates faster or reads more dryly than financial coups of previous decades.</italic>\u201d (). \nTo avoid perpetuating stereotypes and potential political backlash, authors often omit discussions about the backgrounds of policymakers, financiers, and industrialists. Nevertheless, these omissions lead to incomplete accounts and may obscure the underlying historical context and policy decisions. A gender-focused perspective, for example, sheds light on the unique role of female bankers, differentiating performance from cultural and policy influences. Similarly, examining other minority lenses can enhance our understanding of economic developments, better prepare us for the future, and humanize minority capitalists as an alternative narrative to the rising anti-capitalist sentiments.\nGranovetter\u2019s view of economic activity as embedded in social networks points to banking as \u201c<italic>the facilitation of economic trust</italic>.\u201d Unlike regulatory definitions, which focus on formal operations, licenses, or legal status\u2014and change across time and jurisdictions\u2014such a trust-centered view captures the underlying function of banking: coordinating obligations, resources, and influence. Along with \u201cbankers\u201d, such a definition includes banking families, interlocking directors, and political authorities who perform the same relational role, even if they never sat in a bank. By focusing on trust rather than instruments or formal structures, one gains a broader, historically inclusive, and socially grounded understanding of banking and society.\nThroughout history, religions have often bound dominant social groups to the land as serfs or, in regions without cattle, as slaves. In contrast, \u2018minority middlemen\u2019 diasporas, who remained non-conformist, consistently dominated commerce. For example, moneylenders, entertainers, and other roles perceived to be undesirable like have historically been filled by Jews, Christians, and Muslim in Christian, Muslim, and Hindu societies, respectively. But while the Scots, Quakers, and Huguenots had served as minority middlemen for England, they gradually assimilated into the aristocracy, leaving mainly Jews and Asians discriminated.\n noted that inequities are rarely the result of discrimination by dominant groups, noting the prevalence of middlemen bankers, including Greek and Armenians in Ottoman Turkey, Chinese in Malaysia, Germans in Brazil, Lebanese in West Africa, Italians in Argentina, Indians in East Africa, Scots in Britain, Ibos in Nigeria, and Marwaris in India. They maintained their distinct identities through endogamous marriage practices and established close-knit economic and nepotistic social networks that transcended political borders. On the other hand, a lens might produce a bias. By focusing on summarizing the numerous chronicles of great Jews, one might wrongly assume that there were no other competitors or that all Jews lived in the same way.\nThis socio-political marginalization frequently acted as a catalyst for innovation and notably enabled women, particularly widows, to participate in trade and finance. For most European women, this era of \u2018equity\u2019 persisted until the emergence of multinational banks and corporations in the 19th century, which limited family competition and excluded women from the business realm for a century. \nSimultaneously, industrialization accelerated the spread of bonded labor from Africa to Scotland, a point Karl Marx highlighted. Some of his disciples theorized that under Marxism, law would become obsolete. One of the challenges facing capitalism is its ability to resonate with diverse audiences. Some individuals, disillusioned with capitalism, may be drawn to the moralistic simplicity of socialism, while others may exploit the system for personal gain. \nThe co-evolution of gender, race, and religion continues to play a pivotal role in shaping economies. Religious perspectives provide valuable insights into how family lineages historically financed development, often extending credit with guarantees during crises. To safeguard these lines of credit, empires frequently embraced \u2018legal pluralism,\u2019 which segregated laws based on geography, ethnicity, or trade. While this approach provided protection for certain groups, it could also expose them to violence, forcing minority communities into undignified trading activities. \nFor centuries, the Emperors of Austria and Russia expelled Jews from specific cities, the approach was often reciprocal rather than competitive, promoting other cities to excel in complementary industries. However, even those under the protection of royal patrons with absolute powers, court bankers often faced expulsion or execution when their services were no longer required or death of their benefactors. In many cases, bankers chose public execution over abandoning their faith through conversion. Their lives were just part of their commitment to the public good, others including arranged marriage at young ages for communal benefit, often to distant places without divorce. \nAs  observed, Jews had been <italic>\u201cpushed into positions as businessmen and bankers almost by force\u2026 blocked from the civil service, the army, the judiciary, and the trades.\u201d</italic> Excluded from traditional occupations, they \u201c<italic>placed themselves in the holes and cleavages of the medieval order</italic>,\u201d developing what he termed a \u201c<italic>pioneer psychology</italic>.\u201d \nFrankfurt and other German municipalities protected Jews and often enacted Primogeniture-type laws limited the ability to marry and own property to the eldest, perpetuating socio-economic marginalization within the Jewish community, and incentivizing migration. As Frankfurt restricted marriages to twelve a year, other discriminations against these Protected Jews included higher tax rates than Christians, social and economic exclusion and enclosure in a ghetto, while guilds and local laws limited their career options and pushed them into riskier moneylending and commerce.\nThe Jewish Torah links the preservation of lineage\u2014<italic>yichus</italic>\u2014to the substance of faith and transmission of divine teaching, making lineage the basis for the continued connection with God and limiting the Jewish priestly caste (Kohanim) to descendants of Aaron, Moses\u2019 brother, who adopted surnames like Cohen, Kagan, Kahn, Kann, Caen, and Kaplan to denote their connection. The Levites, descendants of Moses\u2019 tribe, supported the Kohanim and used surnames like Landau, Levin, Levi, Levy, Loewe, Epstein, Horowitz, and Segal. \nFocusing on Russian-speaking Jewish families,  compared careers between 1858 and 2001 for three surname groups: rabbinical, occupational, and all others. Even as surnames evolved, occupational biases had persisted for over two centuries. Individuals with rabbinical surnames exhibited a distinct inclination towards professions such as engineering and positions as head/chief officers, particularly in the earlier periods. In contrast, those with occupational surnames showed a consistent tendency to work as laborers. Despite these disparities, the individuals within these groups generally did not identify themselves as distinct, with many bearers of rabbinical surnames remaining unaware of their names\u2019 historical connections to their professions.\nBeyond the second generation, relationships between fathers and sons or between brothers often struggled. A notable exception is the Rothschild family, who first benefited the simultaneous presence of five brothers across five international financial centers. In the second generation, 14 out of 18 marriages occurred within the Rothschild family, followed by 13 out of 30 in the subsequent generation. According to another estimate, half of the Rothschild family\u2019s 58 weddings were intermarriages over the 19th century were among family members, ensuring the continuation of their inheritance and lineage. \nAmong <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s earliest agents, including <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> in Prussia and <italic>Frankel</italic> and <italic>Gunzburg</italic> in Russia, and <italic>Samuel Phillips</italic> in Brazil, <italic>Davidzon</italic> in San Francisco, <italic>Joseph</italic> in New York, <italic>Wagg</italic>, and <italic>d\u2019W</italic><italic>orms</italic> of Ceylon were descendants and in-laws of the Katzenellenbogen (\u201cKatz\u201d) family. One of Judaism\u2019s holiest dynasties, the Kohanim Katz claim descent from King David.  offers valuable this lineage. \nUnlike most descendances in Judaism, Katz-descendancy may be a maternal bloodline as even husbands from esteemed religious and banking families often adopted their wives\u2019 Katz surnames. Moreover, not all Katz are Katzenellenbogen. Per , \u201c<italic>Katz, also Cahn and Cohen, originally not the designation for a specific family, but the tribal designation for every priestly family (Katz = Cohen Zedek = the righteous priest), which is why, for example, the priestly families Gans, Spanier, Straus are also called Katz. However, the family that had the fixed family name Katz around 1800 can be traced back to the butcher (Kazef) Salomon Katz, who lived around 1710.</italic>\u201d\n\u201cKatz\u201d in this work usually refer to the major branches of the Katz family. Such descendancy has been ascertained using Neil Rosenstein or a link to Meir Katz, Maharam of Padua using genealogical website Geni.com. References that note uncertain lineage of Katz are possibly Koehn-Zadeks.) While the Katz lineage is well-documented, the strategic nature of their marriages and relationships is often overlooked without proper historical context.\nKatz-descendants, aside from their financial acumen, also lent credibility to various ventures. For instance, in inter-war Germany, the founder of <italic>Danat</italic>, Jakob Goldsmith, initially faced rejection by a converted Jewish banker but later secured a contract with Ludwig Katz. However, a 1929 fraud scandal involving Ludwig raised questions about the \u2018unlimited trust in management.\u2019 While the Katz family\u2019s influence waned after the Holocaust, some cousins, including <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Kuhn Loeb</italic> (\u201c<italic>Kuhn</italic>\u201d), and <italic>Lazard</italic>, continued shaping finance. \nThe Katz also intermarried with families that were regionally powerful.  chronicles some of the many Judeo-French politicians and banking families who trace their descendance to four families of Protected Jews allowed to settle in Nancy following the <italic>Panic of 1720</italic>, including <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Lazard</italic>, and many others. \nKarl Marx\u2014whose Katz-descendant father had converted to retain his government post\u2014argued that Jewish financiers were essential backers of tyrants, especially in France, Austria, and Russia, portraying them in a conspiratorial, \u201cJews control the world\u201d framework. In doing so, he largely ignored Christian bankers, converts, and the historical reality that tyrants exist independently of Jewish finance. At the same time, he maintained affectionate relationships with his converted elite relatives and admired the cultural accomplishments of the Heine and Mendelssohns families. \nHis collaborator, Friedrich Engels, was heir to a wealthy Anglo-German Protestant mercantile-industrial \u2018cousinhood\u2019 centered in Cologne, analogous in its elite networks to the Jewish banking families. Decades later, heirs of this Cologne cousinhood helped finance Hitler\u2019s National Socialist Party. Both Marxism and Nazism opposed unregulated free markets and sought centralized control over economic activity. Both movements mobilized state power to reshape society and, in practice, led to mass deaths\u2014through famine, purges, or systematic genocide. \nMore esteemed than Protected Jews were the Court Jews, particularly descendants of Imperial Court Jews of Habsburg Austria, Samuel Oppenheim and Samson Wertheim. Like <italic>New York Times</italic> wedding announcements and obituaries for America in the 20th century,  documents family histories from inscriptions in ornate Viennese graves. Although sources are generally scattered, a few compendia help highlight patters (such as ) and ).\nWhile literate Jews have long compiled genealogies, endogamous marriages play a crucial role universally in building trust networks, shaping skills, and influencing preferential laws. Historical examples of this practice include the descendants of Confucius in China, upper and trading castes in Hindu India, and the descendants of the family of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad in Yemen. \nReligion tied together social, commercial, and political law. While Islam tolerated usury more than Christianity, it placed greater restrictions on female entrepreneurship compared to Hindu commercial castes. Although Hinduism promoted widows to commit suicide, Islam allowed remarriage. In Shia Islam, daughters could inherit without sons, while egalitarian Sunnis favored male cousins. While Jews, Christians, Japan, and Germany followed primogeniture, Islam, China, Russia, Vietnam, India, and France practiced partible inheritance. After centuries of development, revolution, and cultural cross-pollination, the attitudes of these societies to capitalism remain similar. \nFrom the Middle Ages through the 19th century, Christian moral teachings and social hierarchy shaped distrust toward profit-making and lending. Overtime, lending through merchant banking gained acceptance and status due to its ties to elite families and foreign finance.\nFor centuries, Arabian society was structured into distinct clans and castes, with nobility at the apex. Tribal leaders, known as sheikhs, maintained their elevated status by marrying their daughters to sheikhs of other tribes and only accepting marriages from noble families. This practice broke the customary standards of kin and tribal endogamy. Likewise, Polish Historian Marek Minakowski argues that most Poles of peasant descent are unlikely to have Jewish ancestors, as the two groups historically lived alongside rather than integrated with each other, especially due to cultural and legal barriers. Intermarriage was more plausible among the nobility or intelligentsia.\nFrom Ottoman Turkey, across the Mediterranean, and in the leading cities of Europe,  traces the how the Rodocanachi and their banking cousinhood descended from the ancient kings of Armenia and Greek Byzantine Imperial Palaiologos family. Among Anglo-American financiers and other plutocrats, descent from Emperor Charlemagne appears so common in genealogical records that it can, in many cases, be reasonably assumed after a generation or two of prominence. Arguably more important is the ability to trace this ancestry than its existence. Along with aristocratic descendancy, non-conformist religion united bankers. \nIn Britain, Quakers played a pivotal role in driving banking and industrialization during the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>. Despite the subsequent success of American Quakers,  concludes that Boston replaced Philadelphia as America\u2019s financial center. Notable figures in this transition were Jay Gould and John Morgan. One of Morgan\u2019s ancestors, Reverend Thomas Hooker, founded Connecticut Colony. His granddaughter married James Pierpont, a descendant of Charlemagne, who became the Pastor of New Haven, Connecticut, and one of the three ministers who co-founded <italic>Yale</italic>. Their grandson began lawyering in the 1810s but ordained in the clergy. His daughter later married banker Junius Morgan, the grandson of a Unitarian minister.\nBefore John Davison Rockefeller founded <italic>Standard Oil</italic> (\u201cOIL\u201d), his third great-grandfather, Solomon Morgan Avery, a descendant of Charlemagne, was a grantee of Chiswick, New Hampshire, and a proprietor of <italic>Susquehanna Land Co</italic>, which settled the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania after America\u2019s Revolution. While Solomon married the daughter of the Reverend of New Haven, her sister wed a Pierpont, the brother-in-law of Reverend Hooker\u2019s second great-granddaughter. \nSolomon\u2019s son inherited over 1,000 acres along Tunkhannock Creek and served as justice of the peace and colonel of militia. A daughter of Solomon\u2019s other son married the great-grandson of Johann Rockefeller, who immigrated from Germany around 1723 and acquired large landholdings in New Jersey. It was thought that Solomon\u2019s second great granduncle was John Morgan\u2019s forefather, but this relationship may be more distant.\nMorgan soon joined other Protestants to organize <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> in 1903. The driving force was Henry Pomeroy Davison, an extended cousin of the Avery family and John Davison Rockefeller. Born to a family of bankers and Presbyterian clergy. <italic>Bankers Trust</italic> became a \u2018bankers\u2019 bank,\u2019 with a board comprised of 12 men from large New York commercial banks, four from out-of-town commercial banks, and three from investment banks. \n<italic>Bankers Trust</italic> was led President Edmund Converse, the grandson of a Congregationalist reverend, alongside directors including George Perkins of <italic>Morgan</italic>, James Blair of <italic>Blair</italic>, Barton Hepburn of <italic>Chase</italic> NB, William Porter of <italic>Chemical</italic> NB, Davison and Thomas Lamont of <italic>Liberty</italic> NB/<italic>First</italic> NB<italic> of New York</italic>, and <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> director William Moore.<italic> </italic>\nWhile Porter descended from Reverend Hooker, Moore descended from bankers and Reverend Hooker\u2019s associate, Colonial Connecticut\u2019s Governor John Webster. As Lamont was the son of a Scotch-Irish Methodist minister, Blair had a heritage spanning over six centuries in Scotland, engaged in preaching, teaching, and landownership in America. Davison soon hired Benjamin Strong, who descended from Elder John Strong, who migrated from England to Massachusetts in 1630 and became as a tanner and Puritan church elder. Benjamin Strong\u2019s mother was born to an influential Presbyterian minister. As Hepburn descended from an old Scotch military family and served as Comptroller of the Currency, he soon hired Albert Wiggin, the son of a Unitarian reverend.\nWith Elder Strong as an ancestor, John Morgan descended from of a Unitarian minister and Reverend John Cotton, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne. Morgan\u2019s private bank partners (\u201c<italic>Morgan</italic>\u201d) operated as family units per . Relying on the support and alliances of the Puritan \u2018Boston Brahmin\u2019 community, <italic>Morgan</italic> did not add partners of Jewish heritage until several decades after WWII. Instead, Morgan\u2019s most prominent partner\u2014Anthony Drexel\u2014had converted to Episcopalism from Catholicism.  \nAfter becoming a <italic>Morgan</italic> a Partner, Edward Whitney recruited his nephews, George and Richard. When the <italic>Federal Reserve Act of 1913</italic> (\u201cFA1913\u201d) mandated bankers and brokers separate, George became a <italic>Morgan</italic> Partner, while Richard served as <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s primary stockbroker. Although Morgan advocated a discretion as a family partnership, another <italic>Morgan</italic> Partner had an affair with his neighbor. When her husband found out, he killed the wife and committed suicide in 1915. However, media reports did not link <italic>Morgan</italic>. And when Richard Whitney became mired in scandal for pilfering from <italic>Morgan</italic> in the 1930s, George remained a <italic>Morgan</italic> Partner for many more years. \nWhile corporations have supplanted many traditional partnerships, familial bonds continue to underpin the worlds of banking and industry. In some cases, these relationships are intricately woven. For instance, after acquiring <italic>Kidder Peabody</italic> in Boston, Albert Gordon married Mary Rousmaniere in 1934. Her sister, Frances, wed Richard Storrs in 1938, who would later become the Head of securities at the premier law firm <italic>Sullivan Cromwell</italic>. In Britain, intermarriages between bankers and the aristocracy date back to before <italic>World War I</italic>, leading to a web of connections that extended across various institutions, including <italic>Bank of England</italic>, the Conservative party, the Foreign Office, merchant banks, industry, and the media.\nAlthough family linkages used to be prominent, with weddings announced in newspapers, the growing sentiment against dynasties and oligarchs has fostered privacy. Privacy of even celebrities is now guarded. However, these interconnections and relationships persist, among long settled and new immigrant communities. The \u2018bamboo\u2019 network, which has connected Overseas Chinese across Southeast Asia for centuries, continues to link Chinese businesses. James Chao, who fled Chinese Communism to America, maintained a close friendship with his schoolmate Jiang Zemin, who later became the Chinese President in 1989. \nChao\u2019s <italic>Foremost Shipping</italic> utilized ships from Chinese state-owned shipyards with government financing to transport iron ore for state-owned steel makers. Meanwhile, his daughter, Elaine, married Republican Senator Mitch McConnell, serving as the Secretary of Labor in President Bush II\u2019s cabinet in 2001 and becoming the first Asian American woman to hold the position. Jiang\u2019s son Mianheng played a significant role in state-backed investment ventures, including collaborations with companies like <italic>Microsoft</italic> and <italic>Nokia</italic>. His other son, Alvin, helped create <italic>Boyu Capital</italic>, a private equity firm by 2011. McConnell eventually ascended to the role of Senate Republican Majority Leader by 2015.\nThe interplay of familial and business ties extends to various cultural and religious groups. Devout Jains Anshu and Ajit pursued complementary careers, with Ajit heading <italic>Berkshire Reinsurance</italic> and Anshu marketed derivatives before leading <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>. The Sheik Banga family similarly followed a strategic trajectory, with Manvinder Banga leading <italic>Unilever</italic> before transitioning to a private equity firm, while his brother Ajay worked as a <italic>Citi</italic> executive before becoming the head of <italic>MasterCard</italic> in 2010. The family connections continued when Ajay\u2019s daughter was hired by <italic>Facebook</italic>\u2019s <italic>Instagram</italic> to lead monetization, and <italic>MasterCard</italic> formed partnerships with <italic>Goldman</italic> and <italic>Apple</italic> in retail banking ventures.\nHindu marriages are influenced by caste dynamics, and high-caste Indians have played prominent roles in leading global corporations such as <italic>Barclay, Citi, Google, Microsoft, Pepsi, IBM, Adobe, </italic>and<italic> McKinsey</italic>. Notably, by 2020, Kamala Harris, a half-Indian Brahmin, became President Biden\u2019s VP as a Democrat. These networks not only bolster Indian firms like <italic>Adani</italic> but also influence American investment policies, including Environmental, Social, & Governance (\u201cESG\u201d) initiatives and alliances across Asia.\nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 2009</italic>, European Commissioner for Competition Neelie Kroes attracted attention for her repeated but misguided assertion that \u2018<italic>Lehman Sisters would not have failed</italic>.\u201d She advocated for greater gender diversity on predominantly male corporate boards to reduce risk. (After her term, Kroes became a Special Advisor for <italic>Bank of America</italic> by 2015). Around the same time, the collapse of Black-owned banks and churches in America laid the groundwork for unprecedented civil rights movements that steer politics and business.\nThese societal shifts carry substantial implications for financial stability and economic development. For instance, the shift towards pro-consumer credit policies and regulatory changes have prompted creditors to redirect their focus from retail customers to private capital and family offices. Many of the affluent depositors departing traditional banks are part of global networks of \u2018middlemen minorities.\u2019\nNewer institutions and associations, such as elite universities like <italic>Harvard</italic> and <italic>Stanford</italic>, have attracted students and investors, creating a bridge from the Boston Brahmin to Silicon Valley. But while Sam Bankman-Fried benefited from his family\u2019s connections with these universities and engaged them in his political capitalism, his collapse systemically spread disrepute to his family and other associates. Such risks became evident in the aftermath of the downfall of Indonesia\u2019s dictator, Suharto, as investors ran from associated businesses.\nPerhaps the most important financial association of this era is <italic>McKinsey</italic>. Since the 1930s, regulatory changes limiting bank oversight over industry have paved the way for the dominance of consulting firms, particularly <italic>McKinsey</italic>. While <italic>McKinsey</italic> itself does not accept deposits, it operates trust networks that significantly impact the global economy. A long list of companies led by <italic>McKinsey</italic> alumni includes <italic>American Express, Citi, Goldman Sachs, Swiss Bank Corp Warburg, Lehman Brothers, HSBC, UBS, </italic><italic>Morgan</italic><italic> Stanley, Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch, Lazard, Credit Suisse, Unicredito, Enron, Johnson & Johnson, Viant, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, </italic>and<italic> Alphabet</italic>. Despite these associations, it\u2019s essential to delve deeper to understand the role of financial panics in shaping these changes.\n<italic>Bias</italic>\nWhile  argued that economic action is embedded in social networks, he noted that revisionist approaches in economics selectively adjust assumptions, reflecting the same principle that historical and statistical interpretations are shaped by perspective, context, and methodological choices. \nThe titles of Banner\u2019s \u2018<italic>The Ever-changing Past Why All History is Revisionist History</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic>and Huff\u2019s \u2018<italic>How to Lie with Statistics</italic>\u2019 highlight the fluid nature of historical interpretations and statistical analysis. Hindsight can guide the data from any perspective. In a sense, history is an infinite fractal. Just as a fractal exhibits infinite complexity, history unfolds endlessly, with deeper layers awaiting exploration regardless of how closely we scrutinize it. Zooming in reveals self-similar patterns across different scales, each with its own variations. \nThe multifaceted nature of history offers diverse perspectives\u2014cultural, social, economic, and political\u2014each highlighting unique patterns and connections. Historians confront the daunting task of discerning which events and stories to prioritize, shaping the narrative subjectively. Just as fractals surprise with emergent complexity, history unfolds unpredictably, with small actions echoing through time, often leading to unforeseen consequences. History remains an unfinished saga, perpetually zooming in and out in an ongoing narrative.\nAccording to Koos (2018), innovative social science ideas such as the constructivist approach to ethnicity, a typology of intra-state conflicts, and the impact of inequality on inter-group relations often lack support compared to less effective methods. Behavioral economics explains this by the human bias for simplicity and dichotomy over depth and gradients. Even as religiosity fell, surveys from 1990 to 2005 indicate that the percent of Americans believing in ghosts increased from 25 to 32%. For similar reasons, conspiracy theories are an enduring part of human society with broad impacts on beliefs, attitudes, and social dynamics. They can distort perceptions and lead to a perversion of reality by attributing events to secretive, malevolent groups. Often, they promote scapegoating by singling out specific individuals or groups as the source of societal problems.\nAlongside the complexity of financial law, understanding financial panics becomes more challenging due to the dynamic nature of history. Historical perspectives evolve over time with changing data and viewpoints, emphasizing the need for ongoing review and open debate rather than fostering echo chambers. In this context, the study of financial panics also reveals how history is inherently political, underscoring the importance of considering context and multiple perspectives for informed decision-making.\nLike the arguments of Karl Marx and the Soviet Union in the Cold War, oppression-focused revisions of financial history are rooted neither in fact nor economics. Since the Napoleonic Wars, America and Europe tried to end the international slave trade, replacing exports of slaves with legitimate palm oil, which African chiefs continued to grow using slaves. \n traces the beginning of imperialism to the deflation of palm oil prices because of the advent of petroleum in the 1870s, fueling competition, and the elimination of indirect rule to stabilize prices. While the West achieved mining self-sufficiency without the need for colonies, Africa and other regions without easy coal access failed to industrialize and so were more likely to fall behind in development. By the turn of the century, the exploitation of minerals intertwined politically and semantically into the exploitation of people.\nPolitical bias is particularly evident in historical interpretations of German colonialism. Early 20th century European accounts often portrayed German colonialism favorably. For instance, British sources admired German colonial efficiency and administration, viewing it as progressive compared to other colonial powers. Indeed, some Africans welcomed colonizers and Europe admired German colonial ventures for developing infrastructure, advancing education and healthcare systems, establishing legal and political institutions, and protecting women and conquered people from traditional slavery. However, when the Herero of Namibia rebelled in 1904, German forces annihilated 80% of population by 1911.\nAs Britain fought Germany in WWI, Britain condemned German colonial rule for her brutality and seized land. During the 1930s, Soviet propaganda and Nazi rhetoric criticized German colonial practices to support their own political agendas\u2014Soviets for anti-imperialist reasons and Nazis to criticize the colonial failures of the Weimar Republic. However, after WWI, Germany was portrayed as a brutal colonial power to justify the seizure of German colonies. \nPost-WWII, Marxist control in East Germany intensified criticism of colonial practices as part of broader critiques of capitalist exploitation. Despite the end of the <italic>Cold War</italic>, politics continued to push an apologetic view of colonial oppression. Instead, tax funded (or advantaged) organizations funded everything from aid to political institutions. When Dambisa Moyo\u2014a Zambian PhD with stints at <italic>BANK</italic> and <italic>Goldman</italic>\u2014argued that these nonprofits crowded out private investment, the large <italic>Gates Foundation</italic> accused her of \u2018promoting evil.\u2019\nImperialism has been perceived differently by various groups: as a civilizing mission, a harbinger of peace, or an exploitative vehicle for White Supremacy. However, this view often oversimplifies the complex interactions within colonized regions. For instance, in Igboland, local elites amassed wealth and power through extensive use of slavery, with individuals like a Calabar merchant owning 3,000 slaves by 1880. \nSimilarly, Yoruba city-states were dominated by warlords such as Chief Kurumi, who commanded large slave armies. Additionally, Tippu Tip, of Afro-Arab descent, wielded significant influence in East and Central Africa through his involvement in the slave and ivory trades. These examples highlight that African agency and internal power dynamics were crucial, revealing a complex historical landscape that persists today, exemplified by the influence of large White nonprofits. \nFollowing Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory in 2016, a generational divide tore through <italic>New York Times\u2019</italic> newsroom, with younger staff members feeling their concerns, principally racial diversity and social media policies, were not adequately addressed by senior staff. Controversy arose over the hiring of conservative pundits for the op-ed section, while at the same time Sulzberger shifted from traditional investigative reporters to hiring social media staff. Among the new \u2018woke\u2019 projects was <italic>1619 Project</italic>, to reframe American history as being driven by Black slavery and White supremacy rather than religion freedom. \nDespite being panned by being by historians for factual errors, cherry-picking facts, and ideological bias\u2014ranging from ignoring the history of African slavery and White indentured servitude to a fictionalized portrayal of the Revolution and Civil War\u2014<italic>New York Times </italic>argued that such a retelling reflects the ongoing struggle for racial equality. Without regard to income inequality and reinforcing a victimization narrative, the goal was to funnel voters to a single party, and refusing to cover any issues outside of their ideological dogma.\nLikewise, this narrative blamed European countries for imperialism. By 2022, <italic>New York Times</italic> claimed <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel et Commercial</italic>\u2014a French bank created in 1859 with little ability to represent herself since being taken over, nationalized, privatized, and merged into another bank\u2014siphoned of millions of tax adjusted dollars from Haiti\u2019s treasury for decades. Within months, financial historian Nicolas Stoskopf argued that <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel et Commercial</italic> did not sign Haiti\u2019s four 19th century loan contracts and made little profit. \nSociety has attached nefarious annotations to <italic>bubbles</italic> and <italic>speculation</italic>. The polite terms today for the original meanings are <italic>corporation</italic> and <italic>market-making</italic>. The British Parliament changed the former as they sought to exchange outstanding government debts for equity in an Atlantic slave trading monopoly. When unincorporated <italic>bubbles</italic> raised financing to compete with the chartered monopoly, Parliament enacted the <italic>Bubbles Act of 1720</italic> to limit judicial aid to activities enumerated in charters. \nAfter the panic that ensued, British firms shifted to partnership structures, and modern pundits screech \u2018bubble\u2019 every time asset prices inflate. In other words, the <italic>bubbles</italic> of \u2014such as the <italic>South Sea Co</italic> and John Law\u2019s French <italic>System</italic> chartered monopolies\u2014are the opposite of the <italic>ruinous competition</italic> the law conveyed. Along with Kindleberger, American Presidents Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson grouped the country\u2019s first two central banks with the former. \nHistorical interpretations also evolve in conjunction with financial theory. While critics of the free market often point to historical manias as evidence of market malfunction, studies suggest that investors rationally priced 18th century monopolies, Dutch tulips, and other <italic>bubbles</italic> based on the available information. In some cases, hidden information capital can distort prices, particularly when assets have embedded leverage, offering option-like pay-offs with limited risk of loss. Bias also comes from changes that prohibit quantitative comparisons across periods. Because of America\u2019s opposition to a central bank, bankruptcy law, and other federal features for most of her history, banks relied on <italic>New York Stock Exchange</italic> (\u201cNYSE\u201d) to mediate inter-state trade and credit until FRS. \nEconomists, often viewed as impartial actors employing quantitative analysis, often align themselves with a range of public and private interests. Despite the challenges posed by proprietary information, they typically rely on broad debt cycles as explanatory variables. However, what if the growth of debt and financial panics are interconnected? Ignoring the energy sector, panics, and administered risks omission in economic models can lead to misspecification errors. This is crucial because panics frequently necessitate changes in policy regimes, challenging the ceteris paribus assumption. Consequently, due to missing data, economic analyses often exhibit poor predictive power.\nEven historical lack of data can shape historical narratives. For instance, popular generalizations of \u2018Robber Barons\u2019 continue to ignore the widespread wealth creation. Illustratively,  wrote: \u201c<italic>This volume attempts to advance the scientific understanding of the American economic system, especially in relation to the rise of American capitalism, by presenting 2 greatly illuminating and hitherto unexploited sources on American millionaires of 1892 and 1902... Yet these 2 documents on American millionaires are of such importance... as to be, in my opinion, the basis for a major revaluation of all the currently accepted authoritative writings on the composition and sources of American fortunes...</italic>\u201d \nAnd while FDR is credited with punishing the financial sector by separating banks and securities in 1933, the idea for the law came from Winthrop Aldrich, Head of <italic>Chase National Bank</italic>, which was controlled at the time by the Rockefellers. For whatever reason, society is poor at updating prior assumptions with new information as needed for Bayesian inferencing.\nPanics are inherently political crises. According to : \u201c<italic>\u2018</italic>Crisis<italic>\u2019 is one of the most underdeveloped concepts in state theory and, indeed, in social and political theory more generally... [R]ethinking the process of social and political change in terms of the transformation of the state, and for rethinking state crisis in this \u2018restating of social and political change.\u2019 I return to the etymology of the term and (re-)conceptualise \u2018crisis\u2019 as a moment of decisive intervention and not merely a moment of fragmentation, dislocation or destruction. This reformulation suggests the need to give far greater emphasis to the essential narrativity of crisis, and the relationship between discourses of crisis and the contradictions that they narrate... Within this theoretical account crises are thus revealed as \u2018epoch-making\u2019 moments marking the transition between phases of historical-political time.</italic>\u201d\n argument centers on deriving \u2018real\u2019 lessons from history, with a particular focus on comparing the events of 1929 and 2007. He emphasizes how history can be misused for political purposes, highlighting the famous quote, \u2018Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it\u2019, to underscore the importance of understanding historical context. However, the study of history is a winding endeavor, and a student\u2019s perspective often evolves with additional sources of information. Bias is inherent in the choices made when presenting historical information.\nFor example,  praised the Jewish Jubilee as a model for periodic debt forgiveness but overlooked the loopholes that stabilized credit, illustrating the selectivity of historical narratives. Meanwhile,  identified three banking waves of banking panics from 1930 until FRS left the gold standard in 1933, and  associated these panics with Tennessee, Ohio, and Illinois after over three decades. By exploring what happened in these regions, we can develop different causes and solutions to those suggested by more general data.\nThe question arises: Does it matter what caused the <italic>Great Depression </italic>of the 1930s? The economy has evolved due to technological advancements and regulations. Yet, like the rise of Nazism that followed in Germany, pundits often cite the <italic>Panic of 1929</italic> and the subsequent depression as evidence for unrelated arguments. Laws gain power from their historical context. Courts turn to legislative histories to interpret meanings, politicians look to economic histories for legitimacy and improved policymaking, and investment managers increasingly use algorithms to allocate assets based on historical performance and trends.\nBeyond laws and numbers, stories with character-driven allegories can influence belief systems. Yet, as humans excel at storytelling, personal biases often creep into narratives, especially when focusing on specific issues or areas of law while neglecting developments in other areas. By expanding the narrative, the writer relinquishes some control and allows history to speak for itself. Bias exists because panics involve polarized politicians, plutocrats, and activists who sponsor regulations to direct collective action. Similarly, money market and credit laws are esoteric and unstable, making it challenging to summarize such issues to voters without bias and adjust for analysis.\nIn this context, <italic>Thunderclap</italic> combines multiple perspectives, including those of bankers, politicians, and other plutocrats, with data evidence. Like credit markets, policy changes can cause investors to run from assets. The effects of bankruptcy of regulations on investors become evident after a succession of panics. Given the political nature of these issues, <italic>Thunderclap</italic> takes a descriptive approach to understanding real-world effects rather than offering moralistic judgments or prescriptive advice.\n<italic>Volatility</italic>\nTo understand policy and investment dynamics, we must first recognize the central role played by the State. Applying sociology to public finance, ) notes: \u201c<italic>Always the capitalists have needed the State to establish profits on a truly grand scale, never have they been able to consolidate their economically, socially and politically predominant position without the backing of the public finances.</italic>\u201d While State tax and other policies shape financial strategies, they are created within a political process. As policy volatility is a fundamental aspect of the system, such changes can affect economic stability. \nExamining the relationship between government and financial institutions, it\u2019s essential to distinguish between the American and European contexts. In America, the federal government, the judicial system, and the central bank represent three distinct approaches to public policy: political, legal, and scientific. These align with to the State\u2019s purpose per , mainly ensuring allocative efficiency, equitable distribution, and economic stability. While American bankers in the State led a one-directional oligarchy after WWII, Europe\u2019s policy elites and bankers maintained a symbiosis. The interchange between banks and governments was a two-way flow, with policymakers transitioning between roles, blurring lines between public and corporate interests. \nA prime example of leveraging state power is <italic>Lazard</italic>. In Paris,  notes that, \u201c<italic>With a few rare exceptions, all the big bosses have chosen Lazard as an investment banker. And as... confessor, in order to share their secrets with discreet and imaginative people... And the fact that a Michel David-Weill or a Jean Guyot can summon a minister or a senior official on the spot is a fundamental element of the power of Lazard...</italic>\u201d Bankers with close ties to the government helped stabilize policy fluctuations and foster international industrial growth. While <italic>Lazard</italic> was split across several countries like <italic>Morgan</italic>, most studies focus on one country or era, missing the aggregate role of political capitalism in financial stability and economic development. Unless the government or her agents become ensnared in a panic, insiders often help shape policy following panics, shift investment from \u2018speculative\u2019 to \u2018legitimate\u2019 activities. \nHaving worked with <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>Drexel Burnham Lambert</italic> (\u201cDBL\u201d) to avoid a takeover in 1985, <italic>Enron</italic> hired <italic>McKinsey</italic> and supported Texas Senator Phil Gramm. After Reagan appointed Gramm\u2019s wife, Wendy, to Chair <italic>Commodity Futures Trading Commission </italic>(\u201cCFTC\u201d) in 1987, she exempted over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives from regulation before joined <italic>Enron</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> board in 1993. <italic>Enron</italic>\u2019s lobbying likewise relaxed FERC merger guidelines policies, and other policies to spur energy mergers and create a national gas energy market.\nMost economic agents are rational in responding to incentives within legal guidelines, particularly for bankers. However, political capitalism is volatile. Legal continuity depends on political control. When the risk minimizing investor fears politics will impact her assets, she will sell them and run to hold safer assets instead. Gun stocks rise after mass shootings since enthusiasts run to purchase firearms while possible. The Soviet Union used this basic human instinct to raise funds by threatening to curb alcohol. Human irrationality is secondary to rational responses. Legal changes rarely make sense outside of legal or historical context. \nThe Modigliani-Miller theorem\u2019s theoretical irrelevance regarding debt and equity suggests that tax instability drives financial innovation. According to , \u201c<italic>Were any country actually to leave its tax system unchanged for a generation or so, an equilibrium might emerge... But, of course, we will never know that Nirvana-like state of equilibrium. For a variety of reasons\u2014including especially the desire to blunt the force of previous successful innovations by taxpayers most governments (or, more properly, the shifting coalitions of interest groups using that vehicle for protection and advantage) prefer to keep changing the structure, thereby altering the internal rate differentials and creating new opportunities for financial innovation</italic>.\u201d \nAlthough complex derivatives typically receive blame for the 1987 stock crash, <italic>Securities & Exchange Commission</italic> researchers traced the trigger to a Congressional bill limiting leveraged buyouts. New rules empowered Federal Attorney Rudolph Giuliani to combat alleged insider traders. While not quite \u2018corrupt\u2019, insider trading (\u201cIT\u201d) is an example of policy flux driven by political capitalism. \n described IT as a form of employee compensation and raised questions about its legality even when it does not harm anyone. After many years without an answer, SEC accepted the theory that there is fraud on the market, and that everyone is worse off if trust in the market falls. However, whether that is true or even the proper comparison is unclear. Market volatility has changed little since the securities regulation of the 1930s or 1980s. Indeed, promoting IT may allow those who know most to refocus operations and reduce equity research, accounting, and legal expenses by outside investors. \nPerhaps the most likely reason for enforcement, as a DBL<italic> </italic>executive said in 1985, points to profits:<italic> </italic><italic>\u2018</italic><italic>[IT</italic> is<italic>] a real problem... the premature moves in stocks... can screw up deals and cause them to be canceled</italic>.\u201d As IT slowed deals, SEC required outsider disclosure until the Court stopped it in 1980. Although IT presented no harm to either sellers or bidders, SEC upheld the public interest principle that investor trust would keep the 1930s from reoccurring. While a viable theory of harm would not be invented until 1988, IT remained legal for policy makers, including members of Congress and FRS, for many decades. But while DBL dominated takeovers in the 1980s, they faced competition from bankers like <italic>Lazard </italic>and <italic>Goldman</italic>, where junior bankers also engaged in IT with insider lawyers from <italic>Sullivan Cromwell</italic>, with outsider investors.\nWhile most attorney generals and media outlets could benefit from apprehending culprits, mistakes are not necessarily illegal, and courts often find it challenging to establish fraudulent wrongdoing. The dividing line between acceptable and inexcusable behavior is difficult to define, particularly when it comes to fraud. Even successful attempts to hold wrongdoers accountable, like the prosecutions of trusts and electric utilities in the 1930s or DBL\u2019s Milken and inside traders in the 1980s, ultimately ended with exculpation. Companies may not always follow legislative intentions, but Congress can quickly amend laws to address loopholes and unintended consequences. As private interests often influence public policy, raising questions about the motivations behind different policy approaches. Is it corruption that drives one approach over another? <italic>Enron</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s</italic> political connections, for example, did not shield them from regulators or the ability to offload toxic investments in the <italic>Panic of 2001</italic>. \nDespite their political power and dominance of funding LBO takeovers, Milken resigned after aggressively pursuing IT at DBL, precipitating the <italic>Panic of 1989</italic>. Giuliani became Mayor of New York and the country slid into a recession; the courts exculpated Milken. Likewise, Americans were furious after the <italic>Panic of 2007</italic>. While the <italic>right</italic> refused to bail out borrowers, the <italic>left</italic> demanded appropriation of ill-gotten gains and imprisonment of bankers. Was there dishonesty and fraud in banks in the years before 2007? \nDid they differ from other periods or industries? Perhaps pay packages attracted sociopaths. However, police departments and politics still attract sociopaths without pay. Keeping greed out of banking concentrates sociopathy in the unregulated sector\u2014private equity and technology\u2014or, worse yet, public policy. While Giuliani secure a pardon for Milken as President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer in 2020, both Giuliani and Trump were indicted in 2023 alleging criminal conspiracy to keep Trump in office. Beyond irony, political capitalism drives policy volatility.\n<italic>Energy</italic>\nThroughout history, societies transformed energy sources. From primitive dependence on human and animal labor to the eventual discovery of novel energy sources, such as natural gas, the journey of energy\u2019s role in human progress is an intriguing one.\nThe story of energy cannot be told without the enigmatic natural gas. The word \u2018gas\u2019 itself, with etymological connections to the spectral and supernatural, is emblematic of its mysterious origins. In ancient times, the province of Sichuan in China harnessed natural gas for heating purposes. This early utilization of natural gas in Sichuan is believed to have played a role in potentially delaying China\u2019s industrial revolution, raising questions about the profound influence of energy choices on societal progress.\nThe allure of gas extends to mythology and ancient practices. It intoxicated the Pythia of Delphia, the oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece, and inspired the fire-breathing Chimera of Lycia. Furthermore, the gas flares of Baku in Persia captivated Zoroaster to establish a religious cult. Byzantium employed it as the secret ingredient for Greek fire, a devastating naval weapon used against invaders. These historical references underscore the transcultural significance of energy sources and their role in shaping belief systems and practices.\nLike gas, coal was not equally distributed, with anthracite for metallurgy rarer than bituminous, which electricity later used. Europe\u2019s anthracite is concentrated in Britain, Ukraine, Silesia, and the Alsace-Loraine-Saar-Belgium-Ruhr Valley. Australia, China, and Siberia dominate in the Pacific, with Vietnam and Korea as Southeast and Far East hubs. But few South American, African, or Indian regions have accessible, quality coal. Africa\u2019s coal basins are mainly in South Africa. While ancient Bantu metallurgists forged with coal, it was of poor quality.\nEnergy needs encompassed more than just heat and illumination. Timber, essential for construction, shipbuilding, and toolmaking, played a vital role in shaping societies.  documents the critical importance of timber in the Netherlands, where shortages led to innovative solutions. Windmills, the iconic symbols of Dutch innovation, emerged to address the scarcity of wood for energy. \nAdditionally, canals were constructed for efficient peat transport, reinforcing the idea that necessity breeds invention. The Dutch experience serves as a striking example of how societies empowered by innovative responses to energy scarcity can rise to prominence, paving the way for their dominance in European banking and trade, and heralding the emergence of capitalism. However, as innovative as these solutions were, peat\u2019s limitations became evident in applications requiring intense heat, like metallurgy and steam power. \nThe rise of capitalism, marked by the growth of financial institutions, greatly empowered the Dutch and set the stage for Britain\u2019s industrial revolution.  found that Britain\u2019s journey towards industrialization can be traced back to the ecological consequences of deforestation in the 16th century. The demand for iron grew as timber resources dwindled. This crisis catalyzed transformative experiments and culminated in the development of James Watt\u2019s revolutionary steam engine in the 1770s. This invention signaled a monumental shift as coal emerged as the primary energy source of the industrial era.\nEnergy challenges were not unique to Europe. In China, during the Northern Sung Dynasty, there was a surge in firewood prices that mirrored the struggles experienced in Europe.  offers insight into Britain\u2019s industrial ascent, attributing it to coal\u2019s proximity to densely populated areas.  provides similar insights into how coal drove industrialization in America. \n<italic>Industrial Revolutions</italic> set the stage for self-sustaining systems where industries like collieries, ironworks, railways, and machine builders mutually stimulated each other, leading to remarkable economic booms and occasional panics. The shift towards coal dependence impacted various sectors, and textiles,  in particular, saw a surge in demand for American cotton and eastern European grain. This period of transformative growth was not without its challenges, as it gave rise to inflation and income inequality, signaling a shift in resource distribution from labor to capital. \nFrom the 1840s, Parliament ended tariffs and slavery, while financing coal, railroad, and cotton ventures. While banks continued to back credit with the stability of rare gold reserves, coal played a multifaceted role, stimulating employment through providing light, transport fuel, and the heat necessary for metallurgy. Yet, the labor-intensive nature of coal mining and the variability of coal deposits had social repercussions, with ties to Marxist theories connecting economic panics to labor exploitation. \nAs society adapted to abundant oil, labor gave way to capital in the energy landscape, ushering in a transition in fuels, illuminants, and lubricants. This transformation marked a turning point, where coal gas, palm oil from Africa, and whale fats from New England were gradually replaced. The first <italic>Great Depression</italic> followed and lasted from 1873 to 1896. \nFollowing her Civil War, America aligned with British principles of free labor and trade. This collaboration aimed to dismantle feudal serfdoms, stretching from the Turkish Empire to Asia, thereby ending the Dutch trade monopoly. It was only when German and British competition deflated coal prices that the Dutch turned to peat as a substitute.  The concept of free trade opened avenues for affordable coal-based transportation, deflating costs for food, electricity, and steel production. \nWithout a central bank, bankruptcy law, or other federalized features for most of her history, America experienced more frequent panics compared to other empires, often driven by agricultural cycles affecting credit. Farm banks typically invested capital after the harvest season and withdrew before the planting season, causing capital markets to inflate and deflate cyclically. Similarly, interest rates fluctuated seasonally, and panics appeared to correlate with droughts and bumper harvests. But as North America and Europe achieved self-sufficiency without the need for international colonies, regions that failed to industrialize with coal found themselves falling behind in terms of development and technology.\n traces the beginning of international development and imperialism to the deflation of palm oil prices. As Africa\u2019s leading non-slave-based trade, the disruption caused by petroleum in the 1870s fueled competition, and the elimination of indirect rule to stabilize prices. It was in this context that European courts legalized cartels, with the Anglo-Dutch <italic>Unilever</italic> emerging as a major player in monopolizing margarine production to stabilize palm oil prices. Beyond petroleum, Dutch<italic> </italic>free<italic> </italic>trade bypassed British cartels. When Britain suspended the gold standard in 1931, the Dutch<italic> </italic>kept it to appease Japan\u2014until 1936\u2014but joined British cartels to stem deflation. \nAlthough gold currencies stabilized trade between 1870 and WWI, coal supported labor and industry. The currencies of nations became closely tied to the value of raw energy sources, leading to intriguing linguistic connections. In German, the word \u2018<italic>kohle</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> means both coal and money, highlighting the inseparable connection between economics and energy. The relationship between work and power extended from the realms of physics to social structure, underlining the profound impact of energy choices on society.\n argues that the development of democratic politics from 1870 is closely intertwined with the evolution of energy resources, particularly coal and oil. The availability and control of these energy sources have not only shaped socio-technical systems but also influenced the emergence and vulnerability of democratic movements, highlighting how the control of energy resources, such as oil in the Middle East on the eve of WWI, was used to impact democratic forces both domestically and globally. \nHinting at the role of German coal strikes in the <italic>Panic of 18</italic><italic>89</italic>, Mitchell does not elucidate either on the consistency of that relationship nor on the broad impacts of panics on societal suffering and repression of democracy. While blaming gold discoveries and speculation for panics during the gold standard era, Mitchell describes coal as an agent of democracy with oil imperialism at the states\u2019 tool against it. While pressing a lot of emotional buttons with buzzwords, this is a simplistic understanding of panics. Moreover, according to this logic, democracy is limited to organized self-interested laborers, rather than as a mechanism for spurring development across a broad and diverse spectrum of labor and geographies like efficient capitalism. \nThe <italic>Second Industrial Revolution</italic> brought about electrification, significantly altering the distribution of energy. This shift involved moving from the physical displacement of raw materials to the use of wires for the transmission of electrical power. Electrification relied heavily on capital-intensive oil imports, marking a reversal from the labor-intensive exports of the <italic>First Industrial Revolution</italic>. \nThis transition from wood and water energy to electricity spanned decades, with the benefits of electricity extending to pre-war Germany, the policies of Vladimir Lenin, and FDR\u2019s rural electrification initiatives. However, American utilities continue to be separated by inter-state energy protectionism, stimulating waste, competition, and lobbying that continued for decades even after de-regulation.\nSince coal became her main export in the early 19th century, Britain spread coal refueling ports around the world and funded public utilities. From the 1870s, however, coal faced competition from oil, the main export of America and soon Russia. Oil and the advent of electricity also promoted Germany to invest in global public utilities and electric railroads until WWI, when America started her global energy empire. \nAfter WWII, however, decolonization fostered nationalizing of electric and other services to protect local industries and elites. When the Soviet Union began competing in energy finance,  alleges Western loans to Asia in the 1970s were malicious, hydro-electricity has deflated East Asian poverty, mortality, and illiteracy despite capitalism\u2019s many flaws. Likewise, many of the loans were written off by 1987. While <italic>Enron</italic> then led American electric investments abroad, her collapse in the <italic>Panic of 2001 </italic>allowed China\u2019s <italic>State Grid</italic> to become the world\u2019s fastest growing company by 2020.\nAs coal gradually replaced wood, the Middle East faced an energy conundrum, lacking access to both wood and coal. The pivotal role of credit and energy in expanding economic activity introduced new dynamics. However, the expansion also brought about challenges in the form of economic panics, characterized by inflationary stoppages and shocks. While empires historically colonized regions with abundant energy resources, there was a notable shift towards market stability in the wake of former colonies nationalizing their assets. The Middle East emerged as a significant player in global energy politics by utilizing oil as a geopolitical weapon, reshaping the dynamics of global energy distribution. After public policy supported domestic nuclear energy as a clean hedge against oil boycotts in the 1970s, catastrophes spurred voter backlash and left indebted utilities in a bind without capacity.\nBy then, central banks refined their strategies, concentrating on managing inflation and foreign exchange rates with well-developed monetary policy tools. Nevertheless, energy shocks continued to be a substantial factor capable of influencing prices and sparking financial panics. James Hamilton\u2019s research highlights the complex relationship between energy policy and post-1945 inflation, underscoring that many recessions were a consequence of FRS\u2019 efforts to maintain price stability, as concluded by ).\nThe history of energy sources is a dynamic narrative that transcends time and borders, significantly influencing the development of societies and economies. As the <italic>Panic of 2022</italic> underscored the interplay between international energy trade and monetary stability, <italic>Thunderclap</italic> extends James Hamilton\u2019s work by delving into the intricate interactions between energy policy, societal dynamics, and economic stability. The intricate tapestry of energy history continues to offer valuable insights into our world\u2019s past, present, and future.\n<italic>Competition</italic>\nTo understand the relationship between the financial and energy industries, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive analysis that encompasses both its historical evolution and regulatory intricacies. While the foundational works such as  and the insights of scholars like Daniel Yergin provide invaluable context, they often fall short in offering a nuanced perspective that fully captures the profound influence of capitalism.\nYergin, for instance, underscores the pivotal role of Constitutional law in unraveling the intricacies of American energy policy. America\u2019s energy landscape is inextricably linked to the Constitution, a document that notably curtailed the federal government\u2019s capacity to meddle with contracts. A <italic>Harvard </italic>Law professor like his wife Elizabeth Warren before she became a Senator,  emphasizes the urgent need for bankruptcy reform during the <italic>Panic of 1797</italic>. However, this comprehensive 358-page book inexplicably omits the crucial aspect of the Georgia legislature\u2019s unconstitutional contractual impairment at the heart of the panic. \nAmerican Constitutional law serves as the linchpin for comprehending the dynamics of state protectionism. Notably, with the dismantling of inter-state trade barriers by the Court, railroads and other industries amalgamated to avoid the perils of bankruptcy and deflation, a phenomenon expounded upon by Kolko ( & ). However, the absence of a federal bankruptcy framework meant few institutions could efficiently coordinate inter-state creditors. Until 1898, state courts perpetuated destabilizing attachments by promoting a \u2018race of the diligent\u2019 (). \nWhile the English word \u201c<italic>bankruptcy</italic>\u201d<italic> </italic>has<italic> </italic>varied connotations, the translation of the German <italic>konkurs</italic> sums up the collective action problem as creditor <italic>competition</italic>. There were no inter-state procedures to impair contracts and reorganize debt across states for over half of America\u2019s existence. Federal bankruptcy existed 1800-2, 1841-3, 1867-78, and from 1898 on. Instead, state insolvency laws allowed attachments for creditors to seize the value of their obligations. State courts encouraged races by awarding asset claims priority to diligent creditors who ran to attach first. While Germany also had a weak federal system until the 1870s, the states formed treaties for bankruptcy and currency. America\u2019s Constitution reserved this right for the federal government. As always, the legal currents direct capital.\nBy the late 19th century, rigid European bankruptcy evolved into a fresh start is America. Reevaluating historical figures, Jay Gould, once vilified for his use of leverage in takeovers and rate wars, has been reimagined as a visionary innovator by . Gould popularized the <italic>friendly</italic> <italic>receivership</italic>\u2014where banks organized corporate debts\u2014America led countries in federalizing <italic>receiverships</italic> into <italic>bankruptcy</italic>. Without banker influence, the British <italic>administration</italic> captured the essence of the process. \nLike competition causes panics and deflation, cartels and other anti-competitive actions increase prices or create shortages. The evolution and impact of anti-trust laws have been well-documented. Congress initially introduced anti-trust laws to protect local and small businesses, but the focus later shifted. Notable works like , , , and  provide insights into how anti-trust laws influenced corporate reorganizations and the macroeconomy. \nThe <italic>Sherman Anti</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>trust Act of 1890</italic> (\u201cAA1890\u201d) played a pivotal role by dividing the tax burden among smaller businesses. After Congress replaced tariffs with income taxes, they expanded anti-trust to collusion. States exempted public utilities from AA1890 to extend stable electric distribution. But as the Court prevented state regulation of inter-state trade, these firms\u2014and other federal associations, such as banks and airlines\u2014consolidated to avoid deflation<italic>. </italic>\nDespite stable railroad and electric public utility prices administered by state agencies, raw energy continued deflating. Notably, innovations in welding in 1927 extended pipelines to Chicago by 1931, linking the Midwest to cheap Southern gas. As the Court prevented state regulation of inter-state trade, <italic>ruinous </italic><italic>competition</italic> of raw energy producers reduced trucking costs, railroad profits, and mining labor. President FDR played a significant role in reshaping energy policy in the 1930s. \nAfter the Court allowed coal cartelization in 1933, FDR extended the stability of administered public utilities to industry cartels and unions. Only after FDR\u2019s labor and environmental protections raised the price of plentiful coal could oil replace it as the dominant energy source. After this experiment led to the <italic>Panic of 1937</italic>, FDR pivoted, increasing anti-trust enforcement except for federally regulated public utilities, which he expanded to include oil and gas pipes, airlines, inter-state trucking, and unions. By ending deflationary <italic>ruinous competition</italic>, regulation\u2014mainly of coal railroads, gas pipes, inter-state truck and air transport, and labor\u2014limited investment and set the stage for future inflation. \nAnti-competition regulations may also have cemented separation of class, race, and religion. As regulations are transaction costs, the Coase theorem implies that partnerships can arbitrage prohibitions on corporate mergers and agreements using marriage, if those laws remain unchanged. When the <italic>Glass-Stegall Act</italic> of 1933 (\u201cFA1933\u201d) forced the separation of deposit-taking and investment banks, the effect was to virtually eliminate Jews from commercial banks, insurers, and large companies until the deregulation of the 1980s. On the other hand, when FDR increased antirust against large firms, <italic>Ford</italic> and <italic>Firestone</italic> heirs married while still in college in 1946, with less need for corporate actions. \nSince the rise of Nazi Germany, anti-trusters blamed monopolies for opening the door to Nazism, which  continues. In response to vertical and horizontal anti-trust laws, businesses turned to conglomeration through the 1970s. Meanwhile, the invention of the minicomputer and related information technology (\u201cICT\u201d) launched the <italic>Third Industrial Revolution</italic> to restructure trade through ruinous competition. More than in previous revolutions, capital controls ICT, allowing systemic risk to fall as coal mining and farming mechanized and their share of employment fell. But as hydro-carbons remain the dominant electric raw energy source, they spur panics and destabilize geopolitics and air pressure patterns. So, the quest for renewable energy storage and transmission accelerates. \nBut, like rate regulation hobbled banks with asset-liability mismatches when FRS raised rates in 1979. After inflation accelerated, President Carter\u2019s Congress began unwinding <italic>New Deal</italic> regulations that protected \u2018natural monopolies,\u2019 cartels, and labor unions over consumers, taxpayers, and future generations. American competition rekindled after anti-trust \u2018New Learnings\u2019 permitted KKR and other private equity LBOs to de-conglomerate corporations to compete better using Michael Milken\u2019s non-FRS regulated junk bonds at <italic>Drexel Burnham Lambert</italic> (\u201cDBL\u201d).\nAfter 1981, the connection between energy surges and American employment underwent transformation, with monetarists linking it to the policies of FRS Chair Volcker. This change, however, often obscured the parallel reforms in oil, gas, and electricity pricing, along with the ascent of private equities employing leveraged buyouts (\u201cLBOs\u201d). Indeed, when energy<italic> </italic>regulator\u2019s protections of customers squeezed gas pipes firms in 1985, Milken-funded <italic>Enron</italic> parlayed <italic>McKinsey</italic> strategy to led national energy policy to de-control gas and position America to fill European needs when Russia invaded Ukraine in the 21st century. \nEntertainers () and regulators () continue blaming greed for panics. In contrast, <italic> </italic>and  follow the courts to absolve DBL\u2019s Michael Milken, and <italic> </italic>similarly studies how misplaced government policies blame tycoons. However, evidence-backed revisions rarely permeate society as the media favors sensational, politicized accounts. After <italic>Enron</italic> collapsed in the <italic>Panic of 2001</italic>, her fraud overshadowed their federal energy leadership. Without a nationally competitive energy market, protectionist states promoted coal or other state interests. \nAs we approach the brink of a new <italic>Industrial Revolution</italic>, competition remains a core question. Against private \u2018stable coin\u2019 digital currencies,  asserted that \u201c<italic>Sovereign states have had a monopoly over the production of circulating money for well over a century. Governments, not private entities, issue circulating money... [P]rivate money first circulated because of a limited money supply\u2014namely, a shortage of specie\u2014and because there were no better alternatives. However, after the development of modern central banking and sovereign fiat money, the circulation of private money was banned to improve financial stability and gain greater control over the money supply</italic>.\u201d \nSuch a narrative ignores that President Jackson sought to replace the federal money monopoly with state charters. The monopolistic charter system gave way to the spirit of free incorporation and banking. It was only during the <italic>Civil War</italic>, as part of a series of taxes aimed at raising funds, that the federal government regained its monopoly. In reaction to a federal digital currency, Florida Senator DeSantis (2023) asserted: \u201c<italic>[A] Centralized Bank Digital Currency is about surveillance and control... which will promote government-sanctioned surveillance. Florida will not side with economic central planners; we will not adopt policies that threaten personal economic freedom and security</italic>.\u201d\nLike nuclear energy, blockchain and other cryptocurrencies are unlikely to set off the <italic>Fourth Industrial Revolution</italic>. Despite the accounting revolution of public ledgers, quantum computing advances would make such cryptography obsolete. However, the two technologies could combine into distributed quantum batteries to revolutionize commerce. While <italic>Bitcoin</italic> wastes energy, a revolutionary digital currency would store and convey it. Whatever the classification, artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d) continues to disrupt more economic and societal facets. Like earlier industrial revolutions disrupted labor, public policy determines which skills AI automates.\nBy the 2000s, Progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren called for labor unions to raise incomes in 2019 and against central bank interest rate hikes to protect Black workers in 2023. Claiming the former would increase the middle class, did not explain that the labor cartels would limit access to only a few workers and raise prices for society in general. Likewise, keeping rates low for one group would translate into raising inflation for all.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Religion & Panics</italic>\nSince the start, culture and government guided the evolution of credit. Following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, Jewish communities dispersed across the Mediterranean and beyond, adapting to diverse environments. Over time, there was a gradual transformation of literacy and urbanization. While some converted to Christianity, others retained their Jewish identity, engaging in occupations such as medicine, trade, and finance. \nThese patterns crystallized as laws since the 4th century prevented Jews from owning Christian slaves, and thereby limited large estates. Conversely, in other societies, such as the Hindu Gupta, trade and development flourished from the 4th to 6th centuries, before succumbing to the onset of feudalism, leading to significant shifts in trade dynamics and social hierarchy. The vaishya merchant caste declined in status and trade fell in the 7th century with the disappearance of gold coinage.\nConquering China and Russia from the 13th century, nomadic Mongolian Khans consolidated their power and implemented succession based on tanistry, which united nomads through internal wars. Following the Ming overthrow of Mongol Yuan rule in China, they became the last Han to rule over Imperial China. Around this time, Confucian clans established ancestral halls and academies, enabling internal lending and reciprocal services. So, despite innovating paper money, emphasis on lineage institutions and kinship morality prevented Dutch and British-style public markets and arms-length finance for pooling resources and sharing risks among strangers in long-distance ocean trade. And despite innovating coal in the north as a substitute for firewood, the cost of coal grew as the Chinese fled south from the Mongols.\nThe emergence of Eurasian feudalism brought significant changes to social and economic organization. After the decline of the Roman Empire and the fragmentation of power across Eurasia, legal pluralism emerged, leading to the diversification of laws based on factors such as geography, ethnicity, and trade. Pluralism facilitated minority diasporas, such as Jews and Christian Armenians, in the transcontinental caravan trade along the Silk Road from Europe through North Africa and across Central Asia to China. For centuries, Jews of Babylonia connected the Diaspora. From China to Turkey, across Africa to Spain and the Jewish princedom of Narbonne led by descendants of King David and served as Nasi\u2014Prince of the Captivity\u2014while looking to the Exilarch of Babylon for guidance and support.\nJews spread from Yemen to key Arabian trading centers, including Medina, Mecca, and Khaybar. Notably, The Qurayza tribe, for their trade and advanced irrigation methods. By the 6th century, the Himyarite King of Yemen had converted to Judaism, but his kingdom was defeated with the rise of Islam. Before becoming the Prophet, Muhammad and his uncle from the Quraysh clan of Mecca traded with capital from his wealthy wife, whom he married in 595. Adopting a hatred of usury, his companions shifted to interest-free lending. \nWhen Muhammad migrated to Medina, tensions with the Quraysh led to the siege of the city in 627, and the execution and enslavement of Qurayza supporters. The subsequent siege of Khaybar in 628 contributed to the decline of Jewish influence in Arabia. Despite these conflicts, Muhammad continued to borrow from Jews, and at his death in 632, his shield was held as collateral by a Jewish lender, who was repaid from the public treasury. Jewish communities continued to prosper in Yemen even as Muslim Arabs conquered more lands.\nFrom Christianity to Islam, religious doctrines defined commercial practices and legal frameworks, shaping societal norms and economic relationships in diverse ways across regions and time periods. More tolerant of usury than Christianity, Islam restricted female entrepreneurship more than Hindu commercial castes. While Hinduism promoted widows to commit suicide, Islam allowed remarriage. In Shia Islam, daughters could inherit without sons, while egalitarian Sunnis favored male cousins. On the other hand, Jews, Christians, and Japan followed primogeniture, while Islam, China, and Russia practiced partible inheritance. Such equal division splintered estates, increasing entrepreneurial competition and hindering marriage alliances.\nFrom the 7th century, Japan had capped interest rates at around 50%. Against slavery, Japan prohibited debtors from paying with labor if property sales were insufficient and freed those who were. More generally than debt and marriage, stabilization of laborers through slavery and serfdom. For example, while serfs were tied to manors for stability, slaves were \u2018mobile\u2019 in volatile labor and capital markets. In the feudal system, crises inflate food prices, while in the capitalist system, prices and income deflate. Unlike with property, late Roman law banned debt payment in people. After Rome, Eurasian slaveholders usually freed their few slaves. \nIn Europe, rulers used conversion to secure power and form alliances. The papacy remained under Byzantine influence until Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as Emperor of the Romans in 800. After Charlemagne\u2019s empire fragmented, his grandson Louis the German allied briefly with Khan Boris of Bulgaria, who initially sought conversion through Frankish clergy but accepted Byzantine Orthodoxy after Emperor Michael III invaded in 864. In 929, Eadgyth, sister of King Athelstan of England, married Otto of Saxony, who later became Holy Roman Emperor. In 966, Mieszko I of Poland converted to Christianity to consolidate his rule and extend influence into the Baltic. His daughter married King Sweyn of Denmark, and their son Cnut later conquered England. Around 988, Byzantine missionaries persuaded Prince Vladimir of Kiewan Rus to adopt Orthodox Christianity.\nIslamic states spread through across Asia to Christian Byzantium across North Africa, employing slave soldiers in the 9th century in their colonization efforts. This marked a significant shift in warfare strategy, with slave soldiers playing a central role in defending Muslim territories. Rather than being conscripted as adults, these soldiers were often recruited as children, raised within the ruler\u2019s household alongside his own offspring. This upbringing imparted military skills but also ensured their immersion in Islamic customs and values.\nAcross the Islamic world, non-Muslim Armenians, Persians, and Jews played key roles in trade, banking, and governance. In the 9th century, Armenians controlled commerce between Aleppo and Baghdad, while Persian merchants in Baghdad managed trade with Iraq. Merchant Jews Aaron Amram and Joseph Phineas served as Court Bankers for the Abbasid emperors, descended from the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s uncle. In the 10th century, they continued under Caliph Muktadir, overseeing Khuzistan\u2019s finances. In 1044, Abu Sad, a Jewish jeweler in Egypt, became vizier to the Queen Mother but was assassinated in 1047. In the 1290s, Sad Daula, a Jewish physician, served as Grand Vizier of Iraq, appointing his brothers as governors of Baghdad, Mosul, and Azerbaijan, but his murder in 1291 sparked anti-Jewish riots.\nWhile Turkic Khazars of Central Asia, with territories spanning from the Aral Sea to the Black Sea in modern-day southwest Ukraine, adopted Judaism around the 8th century, the Fatimids, claiming descent from the Prophet\u2019s family, rose to power in North Africa by 909, establishing a Shia Ismaili state with its center in Egypt. By 1094, the Nizari Ismailis emerged as a rival caliphate in Persia under Hasan Sabbah, a preacher of the Ismaili religion. After the First Crusade captured Jerusalem from the Fatimids in 1099, the Nizari became known as the Assassins by murdering political leaders in their resistance against Crusaders and Muslim rulers. Over three centuries, the Assassins killed several caliphs, numerous viziers, sultans, and Crusades leaders. \nAmidst the Crusades, a Christian military order founded the Templars to protect pilgrims in Jerusalem. The Templars amassed wealth and influence through their network, providing banking and other services to European nobility. Over centuries of conflict and strategic alliances, the Templars solidified their position within the European elite, wielding significant influence across social, political, and financial realms. \nConcurrently, in Egypt, Kurdish Muslim leader Saladin overthrew the Fatimids and founded the Ayyubid dynasty by 1171, establishing Sunni orthodoxy. Less fervent in jihad and buttressed by Mamluk slave soldiers from Egypt, Saladin united Kurds, Turks, and Arabs to recapture Jerusalem in 1187, relegating the Crusaders to coasts. As external pressures with internal divisions felled the Nizari, the Ayyubids faced challenges from Mongol invasions and were eventually succeeded by the Mamluks, who seized power in Egypt in 1250. The Mamluks, with their defeat of the Mongols in 1260 in Galilee, solidifying Muslim control over the region.\nSince a Babylonian prince of Davidic lineage became a princely Nasi of Narbonne and married into Emperor Charlemagne\u2019s dynasty in the 9th century, the son of a Jewish banker by baptized by Pope Leo IX in 1016 rose to Prefect of Rome with descendants including popes and European royals. Over the following centuries, numerous Jews converted and inter-married into the ruling houses of Europe. Those who did not assimilate were outside of the Church\u2019s prohibition on usury, benefiting from legal pluralism, and became the primary providers of credit in medieval Europe  but remained easy targets for authorities.\nJews had lived in French lands for a millennium when Charlemagne\u2019s descendant Philip Augustus II became king in 1180. That year, he ordered their arrest and seized their assets. While he released them after ransom, he then canceled debts owed to Jews and kept one-fifth for the crown the following year. In 1182 he expelled Jews from his royal lands and confiscated their property, allowing their return under royal regulation and taxation only in 1198 after the Church declared usury a mortal sin in 1187.\nAfter the fall of Khazaria in the 10th century, Jewish communities grew in key trading hubs like Kiewan Rus and Galician Premissel, while continuing to link Eurasian trade. While the German Emperor granted Jews protection in Nuremberg as Saxon miners began working in Moravia from the 12th century, Mint Jews struck coins under the Piasts in Poland. \nAround the same time, Jews had settled in northern Italy and Vienna, working in finance and coin minting for royal courts. A few decades after Austria protected its Jewish community in 1238, Anschel Oppenheim became a key financier for German Emperor Rudolf Habsburg. Moreover, the Mongol invasion of 1241 devastated Kiew and Galician Volhynia, leading Jews to flee westward to Poland. \nWhile Anglo-Jewish relations had improved under England\u2019s King Henry II, excessive taxation strained Jewish finances. After the King barred new synagogues and settlements for Jews and required their service to the king in 1253, he destabilized Jewish finances, pushing Aaron of York, the Parnas (Jewish lay leader) of England, into insolvency in 1255. \nAs Crusade debt made knighthood less attractive, barons spurred the expulsion of Jewish creditors. At the same time, the Templars prevented Henry from accessing his mother\u2019s jewels. While Henry forbade land-secured debts to Jews and canceled existing ones in 1269, his son Edward became King and limited Jews from lending money at usurious rates by 1275. The Church played a crucial role by closing synagogues, promoting conversion efforts, and reviving charges of blasphemy and ritual murder.\nWith the end of Crusades in 1290, English King Edward expelled the Jewry. However, the Templars continued to extend loans, manage treasuries, and bank royals and Italian merchants had become central to English royal finance, particularly for war. Warring with France from 1293, King Edward seized much of the papal tenth to fund the war the following year. In 1295, French King Philip IV concluded an alliance with Scotland against England. Within months, Pope Boniface VIII forbade clerical taxation without papal license, particularly affecting France and England.  The same year, as the Egyptian Mamluks drove the Christians out of Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Templars were cut adrift.\nWith the <italic>Treaty of Montreuil</italic> of 1299, King Philip IV returned several estates to England and arranged the marriage of his daughter to Crown Prince Edward II. England then appointed Florentine merchants, notably <italic>Frescobaldi</italic>, to administer the estates and finance the crown, while other bankers managed smaller loans and exchanges. \nIn 1302, Pope Boniface asserted papal supremacy, but was attacked at Italian nobles, and died shortly thereafter. After Benedict XI briefly became Pope, Clement V succeeded him by 1305. Two years later, the kings of England, Aragon, and France initiated the arrest of the Templars, alleging heresy, homosexuality, and other practices. Under torture, some Templars confessed.  Initially resisting, the Pope ordered the Inquisition to seize Templar wealth. As France evicted her Jews, and migrations and credit shocks spurred pogroms across Poland. \nAfter moving the papal court from Rome to Avignon in 1309 under French influence, Pope Clement reiterated the usury ban and overturned secular laws that legalized it in 1310. In England, political attack and the rise of anti-foreign sentiment led to the collapse of <italic>Frescobaldi</italic> in 1311. England replaced private exchanges with the King\u2019s Exchanger and chartered <italic>Goldsmith</italic> guild in 1327 to fund the Crown. The reliance on foreign bankers persisted into Edward III his repudiated his debts and triggered the failure of the great Florentine houses, including <italic>Bardi</italic> in 1346.\nFrom 1346, the Bubonic Plague wiped out half of Europe. After several decades, Poland and Silesia allowed some Court Jews as the Church\u2019s prohibition of usury limited Christian banking. While Christians Mikolaj Wierzynek and Ha\u0144ko K\u0119picz banked King Casimir III (1333-70), the last Piast to rule Poland. Casimir mostly relied on Lewko. The son of a wealthy Krakau merchant and landowner, Lewko dealt property and lent money to townspeople and nobles, including the Mazovian dukes. Casimir entrusted Lewko with administering the royal salt mines and the Krakau Mint in 1368 with a consortium of Krakau burghers. Although arousing the anger of the townsmen in 1369, Casimir rejected their complaints. \nPartnering with David Falcken of Breslau in the 1380s, Lewko served as tax collector for Archbishop Bodzanta and banked King Louis of Hungary, Duke Jagiello of Lithuania, and King Louis of Hungary and Poland, who followed Casimir. After Lewko\u2019s death, his widow and children continued his business. With few numbers, Jewish banking was hindered when Poland prohibited Jews from lending on movables in the 1420s. While Lewko\u2019s grandson led Krakau\u2019s Jewish community in the 1460s, another religious dynasty formed. In Galicia, Polish Lord Mikhal Buczacki leased Kolomea\u2019s salt mines and estates to Shimshon of Zidiczow, a Jewish tax collector, merchant, and banker. After Shimshon died, his widow and son took over.\nWhile family firms long were patriarchal, Jewish and Common law recognized women\u2019s commercial rights to protect interests. From England to Moscow, women often extended credit across religions through the Middle Ages. Jewish women played a significant role in moneylending, responsible for half of loans in Northern France and substantial portions in England, Germany, and Austria, often acting independently or leading consortia. Some, mainly widows, engaged in business dealings, achieving influence and even administrative positions, including Court Jewess Licoricia of Winchester in the 1250s and Parnas Kaendlein of Regensburg in the 1350s. Along with being prominent warriors, Mongol-Turkic female Khans ruled vast territories. \nSince overthrowing Mongol rule, trade flourishing in China until the Ming banned private overseas trade by the 14th century, forcing many Chinese merchants abroad to settle in places such as Java and Palembang. The state aimed to control trade through the tributary system. Born into a Muslim family and turned into a eunuch after being captured, Zheng He became an admiral and led voyages to Africa by 1433 that reinforced this policy and connected China with foreign ports. Increasingly, the Chinese withdrew from maritime commerce.\nMeanwhile, possibly guided by climate change or disease, serfdom fell across Western Europe from the 14th century. As Western Catholic rulers subjugated Finland, Prussia, and Lithuania, which reached to Galicia in the Southwest, present-day Ukraine in the Southeast, and Smolensk in the East by 1450. Squeezed between the Catholics on side and the Mongols on the other, the tsars of Moscow began growing Russia outward. \nAs  Polish, Scandinavian, and Kiewan Rus noble families kinterlinked, Hanseatic trade expanded across the Baltic, driven by free treaties and political merchant leaders in Imperial German cities by the 12th century. Dominating Western Europe trade, the Hanseatic League controlled the flow of monetary copper from Swedish mines. Following the death of the King of Denmark in 1387, his widowed Queen Margaret orchestrated the Union of Kalmar, crowning her great-nephew Erik as king of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden in 1397. In 1406, Erik married the daughter of England\u2019s Henry IV. After Margaret\u2019s death in 1412, tensions escalated, including the Swedish miner and peasant revolt against Danish taxation in 1434.\nOver this period, the Hansa merchants organized through statutes, regional representation, and kinship ties to regulate trade and govern communities. Guild halls from London to the Baltic served as meeting points, and local councils managed taxes, warehouses, and supplies within the guilds. Kinship and family connections were central to these networks, linking merchants across regions. \nWhile Arnd Sudermann, mayor of Dortmund, maintained family links to Toru\u0144, his co-mayor Christoph Hengstenberg, Soest, and Cologne through marriages and council positions, Hildebrand Veckinchusen traded from Bruges with relatives in Riga, L\u00fcbeck, Cologne, Reval, Dorpat, Dortmund, and Venice, creating a wide commercial network. In 1422, however, Veckinchusen failed to restructure his debts and creditor Joris Spinola of Genoa had him imprisoned for three years.\nSince 1289, Genoa had excluded feudal lords from public office, leading families like the Spinola to focus on commerce and the Grimaldi on politics. The Fieschi, who intermarried with the Grimaldi, produced Popes Innocent IV, Adrian V, and Pope Gregory X, the latter through the Visconti, ancestors of the Dukes of Milan. The Doria, Spinola, Grimaldi, and Fieschi also led <italic>Banco di San Giorgio</italic>, managing Genoa\u2019s finances and debts since 1407. \nLike the Spinola, who were interlinked with Imperial Byzantine Palaiologos dynasty, both families were also connected to Genoese bankers in Constantinople who controlled the production, transport, and commercialization of alum from Phocaea to Chios and from there to Flanders and England. Moreover, the Doria and other aristocrats continued to trade and serve as mercenaries in Byzantium.\nWhile Paris lost its role as a banking center between 1380 and 1422 due to civil strife and English occupation, Italian attempts to establish a presence in Lubeck were blocked by the Hanseatic League, leaving Bruges, Constantinople, London, Avignon, Montpellier, Barcelona, Palma, Valencia, and Geneva as the principal non-Italian banking sites. \nFrom 1416, <italic>Medici</italic> operated in Flanders and England through correspondents, relying on <italic>Bardi</italic> and <italic>Borromei</italic> in Bruges and London around 1430. Closely linked through partnership and kinship with <italic>Bardi</italic>\u2014the former bankers to the English Crown\u2014the fellow Catholic <italic>Medici</italic> of Florence expanded from Rome to Bruges, forming international branches across the silk textile trade. By the 1430s, the Medici family extended their influence into politics and took control of Florence. \nDespite funding from the Spinola and mercenaries led by the Doria, Byzantium and the Palaiologos fell in 1453 to the Muslim Osman (\u201cOttoman\u201d) forces, who formed Turkey and pushed out the Genoese and Venetian. Having intermixed with nomadic Mongol and Turkic tribes, the Ottoman Sultans kinterlinked with the Giray Khanate of Crimea, descendants of Genghis Khan, and grew through tanistry. Conquering Arab lands, the Ottomans replaced the Fatimid office of \u201cHead of the Jews\u201d and appointed secular merchants and moneylenders, such as, to oversee tax collection from non-Muslim communities. \nIn the Sultan\u2019s Court in Constantinople, Islamic clerics soon competed with affluent non-Muslims. The latter minority groups competed to finance the Janissaries, the Sultan\u2019s militia of converted Balkan Christian slaves. Exempted from tax, Janissaries often prioritized commerce over military engagements. Forbidden from marrying and facing high mortality, Janissaries did not establish family lines within the military.\nIn Moravian Pressburg, with weak guilds and minimal urban trade, Christian merchants developed trade routes extending into Hungary and Austria while the Jews, having lost their role in general commerce, focused on moneylending. Jewish bankers also played a prominent role in Venice and elsewhere on the Italian peninsula. Wealthy Genoa and Florence were notable exceptions. Lending at interest was a regulated activity, with Christian lenders active across Europe. As the Catholic Church restricted usury, the ban did not apply to Jews. While governments individually regulated Jewish lending, Inquisition soon joined in to enforce the ban. \nWhile the Habsburgs protected Jews several decades earlier, they grew their domains from Austria and Hungary to include Bohemia by 1419. By 1421, Vienna expelled poor Jews. After Cosimo Medici did not renew Christian pawnbroking licenses in 1437, he sold a monopoly to the Jewish Pisa in return for deposit taxes. The Pisa were part of a cousinhood that included their co-religionist Finzi, who served as bankers and rabbis from Rome to Bologna for at least a century. \nWithin two decades, however, Franciscan Friars established nonprofit loan banks. A year after the Pisas\u2019 house was sacked in 1471, Siena founded <italic>Mont</italic><italic>i</italic><italic> di Pieta</italic>, backed by a city loan, and led by a rotating prominent family Still, the Medici welcomed Jewish traders and Daniele Pisa served nobles, cardinals, and popes. \nThe Jews, however, were at a disadvantage to the kinterlinked Catholic bankers. Born in 1465 to Siena banker Mariano Chigi, Agostino Baldi Chigi entered Roman finance by partnering with banker <italic>Ghinucci</italic> in 1487. By 1494 he held tax farms in the Papal States, and by 1495 controlled import taxes to Rome. He gained influence by lending money to Cosimo Medici\u2019s son Piero and supporting Pope Alexander VI\u2019s son Cesare Borgia in 1499. In 1501 he secured the Tolfa alum mine lease with payments to the Pope. His brother Sigismondo married a Petrucci, connected to the rulers of Siena and allied with the Medici, while Agostino\u2019s daughter married a Carafa, whose family married into the Florentine banking Buondelmonti and was connected to the family of the last Byzantine Emperor. Sigismondo\u2019s great-grandson became Pope Alexander VII in 1655.\nBy the early 15th century, the Seiger process for refining silver from copper was invented in Nuremberg. Amidst the growth, Nuremberg banned Jews from charging interest on loans to non-Jews in 1479. Instead, the Catholic <italic>Fugger</italic> of Augsburg branched to Nuremberg in 1486, channeling Hungarian copper westward and challenging Kalmar and Hanseatic dominance of monetary copper. Under King Matthias Corvinus from 1458, Hungary expanded and engaged in conflicts with the Habsburgs over Austria and Moravia. His reign also saw internal reforms, including restructuring the Jewish community\u2019s leadership. \nJewish leaders of Buda, including Ny\u00fal, renewed their privileges under Matthias. J\u00e1nos Ernuszt, a Jewish merchant from Vienna, converted to Catholicism soon after arriving in the 1450s. By 1464, he oversaw thirty-three tolls, and by 1466, he acquired Moravian copper mines. Ernuszt advanced to chamberlain in 1467 and led Croatia from 1473 as he leased his mines to a <italic>Fugger</italic> financed Catholic entrepreneur. As Ernuszt married into a Piast, his son later became Bishop of P\u00e9cs and funded Beatrix of Aragon\u2019s dowery to marry the king.\nWhile <italic>Fugger</italic> financed the Habsburgs\u2019 campaigns, Ernuszt advised Matthias to appoint a Jewish Prefect to manage tax collection from the Jewish community. Judah Mandl, a Jewish moneylender from Nuremberg and a relative of Ny\u00fal and Ernuszt, assumed the position of Jewish Prefect of Buda by 1474. This office passed down through the Mendel family. Upon Judah Mendel\u2019s death in 1482, his son took over the role. With Matthias's death in 1490, Hungary came under the rule of Vladislaus Jagiello. The new king\u2019s policies led to the confiscation of properties, including those of Jews. However, Ernuszt regained his copper mines in 1494, and his son, the Bishop of P\u00e9cs, became royal treasurer from 1494 to 1496.\nMeanwhile, the Benveniste family, descended from the House of David and related to the Nasi of Narbonne, served as Nasi of Aragon from the 12th century, Court Jew of Castile by the 14th century, and after waves of forced conversions in the early 15th century, Abraham Benveniste became Royal Treasurer and Chief Rabbi of Castile. \nLikewise, Abraham Sephardim, with Narbonne roots and of Davidic descendant, served as Chief Tax Farmer and Court Jew of Araon. In 1469, he arranged the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella and united Castile and Aragon-Naples. The Catholic monarchs protected Jews as Senior provisioned the Spanish armies, including during the 1487 siege of Malaga, where he ransomed 450 Jewish captives. Seneor worked with fellow Davidic descendant, Isaac Abrabanel, from a family of Chief Tax Farmers and Court Jews of Portugal.\nAs Spain conquered the Sultanate of Granada with financing from Abrabanel and ended centuries of Islamic rule in Spain, However, as the Inquisition targeted wealthy conversos, Jews faced severe persecution and property confiscation. Failing to prevent the expulsion of Jews in 1492, Abrabanel fled into exile while Seneor converted to Christianity, becoming Fernando Coronel, but died shortly after. Portugal expelled her Jews five years later. Having fled to Portugal after 1492, some of the Benveniste adopted the surname Mendes as they converted, establishing a commercial and banking enterprise, soon branching to Antwerp and Venice to trade precious stones and spice and financial services.\nAround that time, Pope Innocent VIII kinterlinked with the Medici and nobles of Spanish Naples and Aragon. Against a united Spain, France invaded Aragonese Naples with the support of Milan in 1494. Piero Medici, unable to defend Florence, surrendered key strongholds, sparking public outrage. The Medici were expelled, and the republic was restored, with the Medici palace sacked. During this time, Lucca and Florence expelled the Pisa and other Jewish banking families. And as Piero failed to regain power and died, <italic>Medici</italic> failed. \nMarrying his son to the King of Spain in 1496, Maximilian Habsburg proclaimed himself Emperor of Germany by 1508, aided the Medici in regaining Florence in 1512, and married his daughter to King Louis of Hungary soon after. Likewise, after the death of the King of the Kalmar Union of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in 1513, his son married Emperor Maximilian\u2019s granddaughter. \nAfter the Medici invited the Jews back, the Pisa kinterlinked with the Sephardi delBanco family. While Anselmo delBanco ran banks in the Venetian territories and represented Jews to the state, his brother Hayim operated in Padua and partnered with Pisa. <italic>Pisa</italic> also did business with the Chief Rabbi of Padua Judah Minz, who moved there from Mainz. Despite these intermarriages and broad operations, the Medici, Chigi other Christian bankers held fortunes several times larger than the largest Jewish bankers. Still, neither the Medici nor the Pisa regained their former luster, and the Pisa banks closed in 1570.\nLikewise, Moravian, French, and English expulsions between 1492 and 1494 forced Jews to convert or martyrdom. Some may have fled to Scotland, intermarrying into the nobility and forming noble clans. Some found welcome elsewhere, such as Worms, which held Jews as vassals. Other Davidic descendants and likely Sephardic Katzenellenbogen family moved from Treves to Bohemia, married a Luria, a fellow Davidic descendant of Treves, and their son Meir (\u201cKatz\u201d) wed a daughter of Judah Minz\u2019s son, the Chief Rabbi of Padua Abraham Minz, and later inherited the position in 1525 and became Chief Rabbi of Padua and Venice. \nAs Catholic <italic>Fugger</italic> dominated the West European copper trade of Moravian ore through Antwerp from 1497, Emperor Maximilian expelled Nuremberg\u2019s Jews and confiscated their property in 1498. Soon after, Nuremberg allied with Saxon Mansfeld to facilitate the export of Harz mountain copper through the city. With copper and silver coins mined in these mountains, <italic>Fugger</italic> and co-religionist <italic>H\u00f6chstetter</italic> of Augsburg funded princes. Following expulsion from Nuremberg, the Levite Kann and Goldschmidt families resettled along the Rhine in cities before reaching Frankfurt amidst growing expulsions from the North to the Mediterranean seas. \nIn 1503, <italic>Fugger</italic> initiated direct trading connections with India. As India supplied most diamonds and spices, Sephardim played a central role in those trades, first via overland routes through Arabia and later by sea through Portuguese ports. Likewise, Augsburg copper was transported overland to Antwerp and then to Lisbon, from where Portuguese fleets sailed along the African coast, exchanging copper and brass products\u2014including items like manillas, shaving bowls, chamber pots, urinals, kettles, and cauldrons\u2014for ivory and gold. \nWhile the Jewish and Catholic patriarchies mandated monogamy, their opposition to polygamy was part of efforts to strengthen marriage and promote stability. In patrilineal societies, the bride and her wealth and children leave her parent\u2019s family after marriage, while families remain separate in matrilineal ones. Women\u2019s reliance on their brothers over husbands promoted promiscuity. While most societies promoted childbirth for domestic labor, some motivated polygamy to monetize labor in societies without cattle. Matrilineal societies like Mbundu around Ndongo in modern-day Angola traded human \u2018pawns\u2019 to settle debt and crime. While matrilineality reduced savings and parental coordination, slavery may have accelerated matrilineality. \nThis was not due to a lack of other wealth. Perhaps the wealthiest man in the world in the 14th century was Mansa Musa, the Black Muslim Emperor of Mali. His pilgrimage to Mecca in 1324 consisted of a caravan of over 60,000 soldiers and slaves and vast quantities of gold, elephants, and camels. In Cairo, Musa\u2019s spending depreciated the value of gold against silver for years.\nLand, however, was plentiful and not privately owned in much of sub-Saharan Africa. In Rwanda, community chiefs and lineage heads managed land, which gained value only through cultivation. Cattle, especially among the Tutsi, were valuable for their milk, meat, blood, and leather and required minimal labor for management. With unfair cattle access, a form of feudalism developed. As Tutsis migrated from Ethiopia to Rwanda from the 14th century, they settled among Hutus. While the Tutsi minority often herded cattle, the Hutu majority farmed. Under Tutsi kings, Rwanda developed \u2018buhake\u2019 cattle contracts, wherein Hutus aligned themselves with Tutsi patrons for protection and to gain access to cattle. Religion reinforced this dependence.\nFrom a Florentine family of Crimean Tartar slaves, Bartolommeo Marchionni arrived in Portugal in 1470 to work for the <italic>Medici</italic>-affiliated bank <italic>Cambini</italic>. On behalf of the King of Portugal, Marchionni financed expeditions to Africa rom 1480. After the Portuguese arrival, the kings of Kongo converted to Catholicism in 1491, overseeing a religious revolution that resulted in wars of conquest and slave trading. As the slave trade multiplied, the Kongo elite and their Portuguese partners waged wars for land and slaves. While Kongo traded Ndongo\u2019s cowrie shells and slaves for payment for centuries, Marchionni financed Vasco DaGama\u2019s 1498 voyage to India, which enabled Portugal to import cowries from the Maldives for mainly gold, but more significantly, slaves. By 1501, Marchionni financed Amerigo Vespucci's expedition to the New World, which led to the discovery of Brazil.\nWhile some Sephardi fled within to Antwerp and the Americas, others received permission of kings from France to Turkey to build new communities from Bayonne and Bordeaux to Syria. Unlike Sephardi, most Ashkenazi Jews lived in ghettos around Poland, Lithuania, and Austro-German lands from Nuremberg to Bohemia. Since Breslau started the first ghetto during the 13th century, Venice established the first ghetto on the Italian peninsula in 1516. To avoid conflicts of interest, particularly in small towns, many Ashkenazic Jewish communities prohibited the inheritance of rabbinical posts by the mid-16th century. So, the Katz, Weil, and other Kohanim families spread across Europe. \nIn Italy, Meir Katz of Padua knew Joseph Sacerdote, a Kohanim descendant of Aragonese Court Jews. Expelled from Spain, Sacerdote fled to Genoa, which allied with France in 1499. Genoa imposed a yellow badge on Jews in 1501 and expelled them in 1505, though Sacerdote was permitted to remain for several more years. Many other Jews left Genoa, with some possibly joining the Sephardi exiles in North Africa. In 1509, Spanish forces attacked Bugia, Algeria, capturing her inhabitants, including Jews. The following year, they conquered Tripoli, enslaving her Jews, who were later ransomed in Naples, where many perished. In 1516, a blood libel in Novi was dismissed by the mayor, yet Genoa expelled her remaining Jews that year. Later, during Emperor Charles V\u2019s campaign against Tunis in 1535, many Jews were captured, and a Sacerdote organized their ransom.\nBefore the Spanish expulsion, court jew Abraham Seneor, Isaac Abrabanel, and other Sephardi supported co-religionist Christopher Columbus to discover the Americas in 1492. Likewise, England\u2019s King Henry VII enlisted Giovanni Caboto\u2014a citizen of Venice and of uncertain origin\u2014to compete, but not to interfere, with Spain and Portugal in the Americas. However, his son, Henry VIII, abandoned maritime exploration.\nFor millennia, Mesoamerican societies relied on stratified social structures, economic controls, and tribute systems to stabilize their economies and manage resources. Since Maya times, organized merchants formed structured groups that operated under political and religious influences, which distinguished them from European guilds that primarily focused on mutual commercial interests. Additionally, the nobility actively engaged in long-distance and luxury trade, controlling trading activities to exchange high-value goods. \nAlthough the Aztecs relied on loan collateralization, failure to repay debts often resulted in imprisonment or slavery. By this era, commoners predominated the merchant class and needed imperial support for long-distance commerce. Lacking a standardized currency, traders exchanged goods like cacao beans, cotton cloth, gold, tin, and feathers. While centralization helped maintain order, ambitious factions ultimately allied with the Spanish against the empire, leading to its collapse. After colonization, mixed-race sons, born to local mothers and Spanish fathers, facilitated trade between the Americas and Spain, contributing to the Empire\u2019s expansion and the development of new merchant networks.\nSince 1488, Portugal discovered the Cape of Good Hope route to Asia. Prioritizing resource redistribution and using brute force to establish a establish a trade monopoly, Portugal sought to replace the spread of Islam by Ottoman Turks with Christianity while blockading the Red Sea and excluding other Europeans from the Cape route. After establishing the trading port of Sofala in Mozambique in 1505, the Portuguese challenged inland Arab traders and gained the gold mines of Sheba by 1520. Conquering the East Indies ports of Goa (1510), Malacca (1512), and Ormuz (1515), Portugal reestablished European contact with Chinese Canton in 1516. <italic>Fugger</italic> financed some voyages, like that of Magellan in 1519. \nIntermixed Mongol and Turkic tribes who adopted Islam like the Ottomans in Turkey, the Safavid and Mughal families, the latter claiming descent from Genghis Khan, formed rival empires in Persia (1501) and India (1526) like European seafarers. Unlike the 7th century forced conversions by Muslim rulers in Persia that of Zoroastrians that led Parsee to flee to India, the Mughals relied on Hindu bankers and allowed the Parsee to trade with the Jain and Hindu. While Muslims often married cousins, Hindus considered that incestuous but married caste endogenously. Similar to the Jewish Kohanim, high caste Brahmin led Hindus.  \nThe death of German Emperor Maximilian Habsburg in 1519 triggered the imperial election process, with the candidates being Francis of France, Henry VIII of England, and Maximilian\u2019s grandson Charles. Since Maximilian\u2019s son had married the daughter of Spain\u2019s Isabella and Ferdinand, their son, Charles, inherited Spain, Naples, Burgundy, the Netherlands, and their global colonies. In addition to leading German bankers in backing Charles, <italic>Fugger</italic> restricted Francis\u2019 bills of exchange, forcing him to send gold along the Rhine. The electors faced pressure from both candidates, but concerns over foreign control led them to appoint Charles as Emperor Charles V, who was viewed by some as a quasi-messianic Last World Emperor.\nBut the Emperor faced challenges. While his brother-in-law, King Christian of the Kalmar Union, sought to consolidate his realm, Swedish opposition intensified. Christian gained support from the Hanseatic League, but Swedish rebels led by Gustaf Vasa blockaded Stockholm in 1523, leading to the collapse of Danish control. Christian sought support from the Habsburgs but failed to regain his throne after the <italic>Treaty of Madrid</italic> in1526.\nWith the greater import of American precious metal, Ambrosius H\u00f6chstetter shifted from metal mining to mercury, necessary for silver extraction, and sought control over global production from 1519. By 1524, <italic>H\u00f6chstetter</italic> secured contracts from the Habsburg government for mercury production in Idria, Slovenia. \nThe family\u2019s attempt to control Spain\u2019s Almad\u00e9n mercury mines failed in 1526 when <italic>Fugger</italic> won the bid. <italic>H\u00f6chstetter</italic>\u2019s finances deteriorated due to overextension. In 1527, Dutch authorities confiscated six of their grain-laden ships, causing further financial strain in the <italic>Panic of 1528</italic>. In 1528, <italic>H\u00f6chstetter</italic> were forced to repay loan Emperor Charles V\u2019s loan with their diminishing mercury stock. By 1531, Ambrosius defaulted on payments, leading to creditors withdrawing support. He was declared bankrupt in 1534 and died enchained that year. \nWhile continuing to hold finance sinful, Catholic corruption grew. From 1469, Lorenzo Medici governed Florence. A failed conspiracy of 1478 aimed to overthrow the Medici rule, leading to Lorenzo\u2019s excommunication. Lorenzo\u2019s diplomatic acumen facilitated peace settlements, including the marriage of his daughter to a pope\u2019s son in 1488. His efforts extended to influencing papal elections, leading his son Giovanni to become a cardinal at 13. By 1513, Giovanni became Pope Leo X and Lorenzo\u2019s brother Giuliano married French King Francis I\u2019s aunt. As his relatives gained influential positions within the Church, Leo\u2019s cousin, Giuliano\u2019s son Cardinal Giulio Medici, became his chief advisor. Along with the papacy, Leo\u00a0X assumed leadership of the construction of Saint-Peter\u2019s Basilica. \nThat same year, Nuremberg intellectuals leveled accusations against <italic>Fugger</italic>\u2019s Jacob Fugger, denouncing him for usury per the Church\u2019s ban on interest. Fugger, already entangled with the Basilica\u2019s financial woes, was not idle. In 1514, he loaned money to Albrecht of Hohenzollern to secure the Archbishopric of Mainz. To address his mounting debts and allow Albrecht to repay his loan, Pope Leo\u00a0X authorized the sale of indulgences and, in 1515, issued a papal bull permitting interest under conditions tied to labor, cost, or risk. \nBy 1517, the indulgence scheme had become a critical financial tool as half the proceeds funded the Basilica and the remainder supported <italic>Fugger</italic>\u2019s ventures. In Germany, Johann Tetzel led this campaign. Among its most vocal detractors was Martin Luther, a scholar from a Saxon mining family. In 1517, he published his 95 Theses, directly challenging the practice of selling indulgences and the broader authority of the papacy. The ensuing conflict intensified when Cardinal Cajetan summoned Luther to Augsburg the following year, demanding a retraction. Luther\u2019s refusal led to his excommunication by Pope Leo\u00a0X in 1521, and soon after, Emperor Charles\u00a0V\u2019s Diet of Worms declared him an outlaw, fueling the <italic>Protestant Reformation</italic>.\nAfter Leo died in 1521, Cardinal Medici then became Pope Clement VII in 1523 following the death of another pope. Initially aligning with Emperor Charles V, Clement later sided with French Frances I, leading Charles to sack Rome in 1527. After Charles and Clement reconciled, the Medici regained Florence, and wed the French king\u2019s son, Charles\u2019 daughter, and Charles\u2019 third cousin, a daughter of his Viceroy.\nWhile Genoa allied with France from 1499, Spain gained control of Genoa after defeating the French in 1522. Admiral Andrea Doria disrupted this control by supporting the French in 1527, but realigned Genoa with the Habsburgs months later. As Doria organized Genoa\u2019s nobles into coalitions in 1528, Genoese bankers dominated Spain\u2019s banks in Seville and Naples, where they managed grain supplies and served as regional regents. They similarly supported Spain\u2019s colonial trade and finances out of Antwerp.\nMore than corruption, the <italic>Protestant Reformation</italic> dealt with business law. Early bankruptcy laws in some European countries were focused on debtors who fled with their possessions. These laws applied only to those who absconded. But, during a crisis in the 1510s, the laws evolved to include honest insolvent debtors who did not intend to commit bankruptcy, and sometimes received letters of protection. Splitting the Catholic Church\u2019s monopoly, the <italic>Protestant Reformation</italic> debated marriage-based partnerships. With expensive and scattered judicial protection of private rights, official contracts secured investment. \nAs Protestantism allowed clergy to marry, children linked religious, commercial, and political spheres. And as Protestantism theology rejected the need of infant baptism for salvation, the role of godparents in spiritual upbringing lost importance. In reaction, the <italic>Counter Reformation</italic> made godparenthood more rigid. So, as Catholic Mediterranean countries stabilized socio-economic structures, Protestant used godparenthood to build contractual trust and limit business risk. Without a similar concept and marriage witnessing governed by religious ceremonies, Jews depended on endogamy to forge alliances and doweries to protect capital.\nIn Alsace, Rabbi Josel of Rosheim, a cousin of the Luria and Katz families through his third great-grandfather, the Chief Rabbi of France, Josel was a and pawnbroker. As serf rebellions spread from Alsace in 1524, he warned Rosheim of an attack, helping prepare defenses, and negotiating with peasant leaders. Grateful, Rosheim granted him residency, and he became the leader of the Alsatian Jews. In 1528, Josel convinced Charles V\u2019s brother King Ferdinand I in Prague to revoke an expulsion decree against Jews. \nAlthough initially having persecuted Jews, Charles V allowed them to lend at usurious rates in 1532. Progressing from verbal abuse, Luther\u2019s followers expelled of Jews from Saxony in 1537, but failed to expel them from Brandenburg in 1543. By 1572, they sacked the Berlin Synagogue in 1572 and expelled Jews in 1573. Likewise, Frederic of Simmern and other followers of usury-hating John Calvin expelled Jews. With army funds and supplies from Josel, Charles appointed him Commander of German Jews and prevented expulsions from 1530 to 1546. Later, Charles split the reign of Germany and Spain to his brother son, Philip.\nWhile Jews had settled in Sarajevo after Turkish conquest of Bosnia in 1463, many more found refuge in the empire after the Spanish expulsion in 1492. By the early 17th century, Constantinople\u2019s Jewish population was between 25,000 and 40,000, making it the largest Jewish community in the empire. During Sultan Suleiman Ottoman\u2019s reign (1520\u20131566), Turkey expanded through military campaigns, including the conquest of Hungary in 1526 and the siege of Vienna in 1529. \nWhen Hungary fell to the Turks, most of the leading nobles lost their lives, the Habsburg widow of the slain Hungarian king expelled the Jews of Pressburg, \u00d6denburg, and Esztergom. As some Jews found refuge under lesser lords, Isaac Mendel briefly lost his title as Prefect of Hungarian Jews, but then continued to negotiate in estate sales. While the Habsburgs no longer competed with Hungary for Austria, Suleiman signed a treaty with France in 1535 against Charles V, granting European merchants, including Jewish traders, economic privileges. \nBy 1538, the Turkish conquest of Moldavia and Wallachia, led to the division of Hungary among the Ottoman, Habsburg, and kingdoms, with plans for unification under Habsburg if Z\u00e1polya died heirless. In 1539, Z\u00e1polya married King of Poland Jagiellon\u2019s daughter, and had a son. As Z\u00e1polya died in 1540, conflict reignited with Isabella\u2019s supporters opposing Habsburg, Buda fell to Turkey, splitting Hungary in three and ending the Mandl\u2019s reign as Prefects of Hungarian Jews. Although Pressburg became the capital of Habsburg Hungary, Hungarian-Moravian trade withered without the Jews.\nEarlier, as the threat of Portuguese expulsion and Inquisition grew, Portuguese New Christians fleeing the registered in Antwerp and Emperor Charles V granted them religious immunity by 1526. In Portugal from 1530, the Seneor-Coronel and Ximenes families kinterlinked with Diogo Benveniste-Mendes to monopolize the Asian spice trade, sidelining <italic>Fugger</italic>. Likewise, Diogo\u2019s brother Francisco traded spice out of Antwerp and banked Europe. \nThe Portuguese spice monopoly spurred competitors, including under the French banner. While Diogo Mendes continued to trade spices, sugar, and precious goods and engage in Judaism, accusations reached the Emperor, who ordered Mendes\u2019 arrest in 1532. Antwerp magistrates protested, citing city privileges. Henry VIII and the King of Portugal intervened. After several months and paying a large amount, Mendes was released and most charges were dropped. \nAs Naples prepared to expel her Jews in 1533, Parnas of Naples Samuel Abrabanel\u2014a son of Portuguese Court Jew Isaac Abrabanel\u2014advised the Viceroy to halt the order. Francisco\u2019s wife, Beatrice, meanwhile, resided in Ferrara, she aided refugees of the Inquisition. When Francisco died in 1536, Beatrice moved to Antwerp to bank the spice trade. Longing to practice her religion openly, Beatrice fled to Venice.\nFollowing the Mendes scandal, Emperor Charles, allowed New Christians to settle in Antwerp with immunity for offenses elsewhere in 1537. After the Lisbon Inquisition began in 1539, mass flight from Portugal increased. Milan arrested suspects in 1540, some allegedly funded by Mendes. That year, the Emperor ordered action against suspect New Christians in Antwerp. Mendes continued financial operations until his death around 1543.\nBy then, Portugal expelled her Jews in 1541. While Samuel Abrabanel moved to Ferrara, his cousins moved to Ancona and received a papal license in 1543 to open a bank in competition with co-religionist <italic>Bonaventura</italic> who had operated for generations. After Samuel died, his widow\u2014also a cousin\u2014continued banking with her sons and sons-in-law, including Jacob, who became Cosimo Medici\u2019s banker.\nIn 1546, Portugal colonized the Chinese Port of Macao. By then, Portuguese crypto-Jews led Portugal\u2019s colonial trade with Brazil, India, West Africa, and the Low Countries, while Spanish-speaking Jews from Salonica displaced the Venetians and Florentines to dominate internal trade across Greece and the Balkans. Within year, the Portuguese Inquisition brought death to 30,000 Jews who refused to convert. Along with targeting Antwerp\u2019s Protestants, the Inquisition of 1550 expelled converted Jews from Venice, spreading crises. Upon Jacob Abrabanel\u2019s advice, Cosimo Medici invited Levantine Jews to Tuscany in 1551.\nHowever, as the Inquisition continued, Diogo\u2019s window accused her sister Beatrice of Judaism to get her inheritance, leading Beatrice turned to Turkish diplomats and resettled in Constantinople by 1553. Continuing to aid the Inquisition\u2019s victims, Beatrice and her nephew, Joseph, represented Turkey in a trade consortium with European monarchs. Winning Cyprus for the Ottomans, Joseph was appointed the Duke of Naxos and other Cyclades islands. United in purpose, Beatrice and Joseph supported and advocated for peace with Poland and Jewish resettlement. However, most failed.  \nAfter over a century of conflict with France and Scotland, English King Henry VII signed a treaty in 1502 with Scottish King James IV, who wed Henry\u2019s daughter. In 1509, Henry VII died, and his son ascended the throne as Henry VIII, marrying Catherine of Aragon, the aunt of Emperor Charles V. Another of Henry VII\u2019s daughters married French King Louis XII in 1514, but he died shortly afterward, and she returned to England to marry for love. By then, King James IV of Scotland had also died, and his son, James V, succeeded him.\nWhen Henry VIII sought permission to divorce Catherine in 1534, Charles V lobbied Medici cousin Pope Clement to refuse the request. (Although Clement soon died, the Medici remained tied to the Habsburgs and in control of Florence. ) Henry, however, broke from the authority of the Catholic Church, which allowed him to dissolve monasteries and create a land market. Among other radical reforms, he legalized interest on loans up to 10% in 1545. Without an English money market, Henry relied on Richard Gresham as his King\u2019s Exchanger and agent in Antwerp, where Gresham traded wool and silk between England and Spanish-controlled Antwerp, as well as metals with <italic>H\u00f6chstetter</italic>. Gresham also married into Henry\u2019s extended family.\nMeanwhile, James V of Scotland married Mary of Guise from the Catholic House of Lorraine, which controlled Burgundy and Champagne. With his death, his daughter Mary became Queen of Scots. After Henry VIII\u2019s death, his Catholic daughter, Mary I ascended the throne. In 1554, she married Philip Habsburg, the son of Emperor Charles V, which strengthened the Habsburg encirclement of France. Mary earned her infamous nickname \u201cBloody Mary\u201d, by persecuting Protestants and aligning with Spain in its war against France. After the war, both Spain and France defaulted on their debts.\nIn 1558, Mary died, and her Protestant half-sister, Elizabeth, became queen. Elizabeth\u2019s cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, married the French crown prince, Fran\u00e7ois, that year. When Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 father, King Henry II of France, died, Fran\u00e7ois became king but died a year later. His mother, Catherine Medici, then ruled France as regent. Backed by French troops, Mary returned to rule only over Scotland. \nUnder Elizabeth, England criminalized core aspects of Catholicism in 1559, with later laws imposing fines, imprisonment, and execution for recusancy, celebrating Mass, or harboring priests. Elizabeth continued to rely on Thomas Gresham, who had succeeded his father in royal duties and co-founded <italic>Royal Exchange</italic>. Adopting financial practices from Antwerp, <italic>Royal Exchange</italic> centralized the market for bills of exchange, which legal changes gradually made exchangeable. \nIn 1546, the <italic>Schmalkaldic War</italic> began when Protestant princes in Germany clashed with Emperor Charles V\u2019s Catholic forces. The war ended in 1547 with the defeat of the Protestants, who were split between Lutheran and Calvinist alliances. The <italic>Peace of Augsburg</italic> in 1555 officially recognized Lutheranism within the Empire but declared Calvinism heretical, creating legal grounds for the persecution of Calvinists. As Charles V defaulted on his debts, he allowed <italic>Fugger</italic> to take control of royal land and monopolies. \nBy 1560, nearly two million French people had converted to Calvinism, particularly in regions like Normandy, La Rochelle, and Dauphin\u00e9, with notable Huguenot strongholds in Montpelier and N\u00eemes. In 1562, following France\u2019s default on her debts after the costly wars with Spain and England, the Huguenots, fueled by financial support from Calvinists in Antwerp and German Protestants, revolted, leading to the outbreak of the French Wars of Religion.\nIn 1565, Mary, Queen of Scots, wed the Protestant Henry Stuart, who became King of Scots. When Darnley was assassinated in 1567, suspicion fell on Mary. Despite Elizabeth\u2019s advice to find the culprits, Mary married James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, a prime suspect in Stuart\u2019s murder. This sparked a rebellion that led to Mary\u2019s imprisonment and her infant son, James VI, being crowned King of Scots and raised as a Protestant. Simultaneously, another Huguenot revolt led France to default, triggering a crisis in Venice and spreading famine and economic instability through Italy and Spain. As the Calvinist Dutch rose against the Catholic Habsburgs, beginning the <italic>Eighty Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, while the Medici consolidated control over Tuscany.\nAlthough kings Charles IX of France and Philip II of Spain supported peace with the Protestants, Huguenot leader Gaspard Coligny met with the rebellious Dutch leaders William of Orange and Louis of Nassau in 1570. While the French government contemplated arresting Huguenot leaders, Charles IX instead supported them, marrying his daughter to the Huguenot Henri Navarre of Bourbon in 1572. An assassination attempt on Coligny within four days of this alliance prompted Huguenots to demand justice. Fearing an uprising, Charles IX authorized the execution of Protestant leaders, leading to a brutal massacre.\nMeanwhile, in Genoa, financial fairs utilized a system known as \u201cdry exchange\u201d to advance credit to Spain and facilitate inter-regional trade. Since Catholic law deemed usury sinful, bankers in Genoa and other Italian jurisdictions circumvented these restrictions by settling fair bills on their books.  As credit tightened and interest rates rose, the Papacy banned a popular form of Genovese exchange credit, exacerbating the financial crisis. This interruption in credit led Spain to default in 1575, decimating trade from Genoa to Seville.\nIn contrast, Antwerp\u2019s financial system employed negotiable bills of exchange, which inspired private money changers and stock exchanges for settling bills in Northern Europe. However, the negotiable distribution of Spanish debt through endorsements made transferring money between Spain and Antwerp increasingly difficult, precipitating a crisis in Antwerp. As Antwerp\u2019s population revolted, the Habsburgs quelled the unrest, culminating in the sack of Antwerp. Subsequently, Amsterdam, Venice, and Naples restricted endorsements, and failures spread throughout Italy. With rising bankruptcies, Tuscany imprisoned defaulters and made such defaults hereditary, further undermining Florentine trade. Consequently, the Medici began to lose influence in the Vatican to the financially dominant Genoese. \nIn Antwerp, brothers Rui and Fern\u00e3o Ximenes, Old Christians originally from Portugal, founded a trading company in 1572, specializing in spices, sugar, and jewels. Ximenes aligned with New Christian families like the Seneor-Coronel, Rodrigues-Evora, and Gomes-Elvas. During the <italic>War of the Portuguese Succession</italic>, <italic>Ximenes</italic> supported Philip II Habsburg over Dom Antonio, prioritizing stability for their trade interests. \nAfter his defeat in Lisbon in 1580, Dom Antonio sought refuge in England. Antonio\u2019s banker, \u00c1lvaro Mendes, was related to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s doctor, Rodrigo Lopez. As <italic>Ximenes</italic> thrived in the enlarged Spain, Fern\u00e3o received privileges from Tuscan Grand Duke Ferdinando Medici to settle in Florence and his nephew Sebasti\u00e3o married a Medici in 1591. Within a year, the Medici invited the Sephardim to settle in Pisa and Livorno.\nIn 1589, King Philip II violated the Indian contract and paid contractors in pepper due to financial strain. In 1591, unable to sell the entire pepper supply, the Spanish Crown sold shares to a consortium including the Catholic <italic>Fugger</italic> and <italic>Malvenda</italic> of Burgos, as well as <italic>Ximenes</italic> and <italic>Rovelasca</italic> of Milan, who had ties to Marrano networks. In 1592, English privateers seized a large shipment of Portuguese spices, including pepper. \nThe English Crown set resale prices, offering <italic>Fugger</italic> and <italic>Ximenes</italic> their confiscated stock, which they refused. Dutch merchants expanded their direct spice trade, bypassing Iberian-controlled markets. By the mid-1590s, the Dutch and English intensified competition by launching their own voyages to Asia, undermining Lisbon\u2019s monopoly. The English used piracy to acquire spices, while Dutch merchants redirected trade through Amsterdam, reducing Hamburg\u2019s role. By 1595, Iberian dominance weakened as northern European powers established independent supply routes.\nSpanish legal pluralism allowed for the continuation of native practices. Spaniards enslaved conquered Mesoamericans\u2014often freeing Christian converts\u2014and imported African enslaved pawns. Second to the Kongo Empire, Ndongo enserfed and enslaved people as part of conquest or civil disobedience. Ndongo\u2019s slave trade was highly regulated, and it was illegal to sell free people. As Kongo and Portugal battled Ndongo, Portuguese traders began exporting dozens of thousands of Ndongo\u2019s slaves to Brazil. Portugal also lost her monopoly on the African gold trade by the mid-16th century as French and English interlopers diverted half of Africa\u2019s gold imports. As American treasure enriched Europe, it flowed East to China and Japan. \nUnlike authoritative Central Europe and Islamic lands, Japanese feudal Lords fought over land. With the breakdown in trade as a common thread, reactions differed globally. Amidst persistent civil war in Japan, ten merchants were executed for charging high rates and trading with borrowed money in 1591. Within a year, the feudal lord of Japan\u2019s rice bowl, Kanto, invaded China. As he died, Korea banned foreign trade. \nAs England and Spain warred from 1585, Queen Elizabeth forced merchants to lend money at low interest as aldermen. By 1597, England and Scotland allowed local administrators to implement poor laws by forcing marriages and children into workhouses. With more shipbuilding, wood inflation drove London to subsidize coal for the poor. As English forces occupied Catholic Ireland, Scotland enserfed coalers to mine coal for export. Scotland also burned witches at the time, along with Germany. But as Polish and Russian grain export fell in purchasing power, nobles reinforced feudalism. In Russia, slavery gave way to serfdom.\nSince the reign of Suleiman Ottoman (1520-1566), the Harem, initially secluded, became vital to the court as a separate entity. Within the Harem, the mother of the ruling sultan, the Sultana Valideh, held the highest position, followed by the mothers of his sons. The Chief Eunich managed the Harem, which was guarded by eunuchs. Mostly from Africa and the Caucasus, eunuchs were administrators and educators. Their lack of familial ties assured loyalty. Sultans similarly used Christian renegades from conquered areas due to their outsider status. On behalf of the Sultana Valideh, kiras\u2014Jewish agents working\u2014facilitated diplomatic interactions with foreign leaders. Amidst an uprising in 1600, rebels murdered a kira for debasing coins, blaming Safiye for his amassed wealth. So, the palace took precautions in decreeing further debasements. \nAmidst the crisis, Spain colonized the Philippines, who soon embraced Catholicism. To fund the global wars, Spain debased currency domestically and then expelled Muslims to deflect attention. Unlike China and Japan, Mughal India did not restrict foreign merchants, leading the English and Dutch to establish <italic>East Indies Co</italic> (\u201cEIC\u201d)<italic> </italic>and <italic>Dutch East Indies Co</italic> (\u201cVOC\u201d) with exclusive trading monopolies and military powers.\nSince the Spanish sack of Antwerp, Calvinists fled to Amsterdam, Cologne, Frankfurt, and other cities. Johann Bodeck moved to Frankfurt, where he reestablished his business operations, focusing on banking and wholesale trade. He created a network connecting major European cities, dealing in copper and bills of exchange. Similar violence and Anabaptist hunts of the 16th century drove Mennonites to Holland. While the Dutch were mainly Calvinist, minority Mennonites practiced adult baptism and pacifism, which barred them from public office and military roles. \nBy the early 17th century, Mennonites made up 14% of Haarlem and were influential in the textile sector. Although some Mennonites invested in VOC\u2014although many sold their shares as VOC encouraged illegal privateering\u2014and married into Calvinist regent families, most were endogamous. For example, cloth merchant Pieter Wynants married Rotterdam mayor Adriaan Verschuyren\u2019s sister, and Wynant\u2019s sister married Laurens Reael, a merchant and son of a former Secretary of the Admiralty. Likewise, Wynants related to cloth merchant Abraham Hulst, who was a cousin-in-law of Mennonite dyer Jacob Block. Similarly, the Calvinist Neufville family settled in Amsterdam, became traders and bankers, and kinterlinked with Mennonites. \nEngland\u2019s wartime crisis destabilized all classes. But even primogeniture could not save feudal lords from using their manors to secure usurious debt. They borrowed from merchants and wealthy heirs. The latter were often female spinsters and widows, as English common law entitled the latter to a third of the estate. After Queen Elizabeth died, King of Scots James VI became King of England as James I, uniting both lands. He soon leased monopolies for textiles, coal, EIC, and <italic>Virginia Co</italic>, with a northern branch in Plymouth. \n<italic>Virginia </italic>used martial law on indentured children and vagrants to fulfill term-based contracts. Regaining power in the 1620s, England\u2019s Parliament nationalized <italic>Virginia</italic><italic> </italic>(before King Charles chartered <italic>Massachusetts</italic><italic> Bay Co</italic>) and forbade the Crown\u2019s monopoly tax. Indentures paid for transport with four years labor. Like on European and Japanese manors, colonial planters exercised total law over autonomous concerns. \nLike in Japan, Polish kings had limited power. Since Christian feudal Lords supplied the monarchy\u2019s armies and oversaw fiscal administration under the decentralized political structure of the Poland, Jews had closer ties to magnates and nobility. While Lords\u2019 Jews leased the right to sell vodka and collect taxes, King Sigismund I extended privileges to Jews that his forefathers limited first to nobles and then to Christians. \nAfter Abraham Jaffe moved to Poland from Prague, Sigismund appointed him Chief Tax collector and Prefect of Polish Jews in 1512. Jaffe\u2019s family later returned home in Austria. Against the Protestant stronghold in Bohemia, Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand reinstated the Archbishop of Prague and expelled the Jews in 1561. As Katz and other refugees fled, Abraham Jaffe\u2019s descendant Mordecai moved to Poland.\nFrom 1576, Emperor Ferdinand\u2019s grandson, Rudolf II became Emperor and moved the court from Vienna to Prague in 1583 until his death in 1612. During Rudolf\u2019s reign, Prague Jews obtained trade privileges. One of three community elders, Davidic descendant Mark Meisel rose to become Parnas of Prague and Rudolf\u2019s Court Jew. As Meisel paved the Jewish ghetto and built a synagogue, his relative married into a Luria descendant and Katz cousin. Meisel also worked with Judah Lowe, a Luria descendant and nephew of Rabbi of Germany Jacob of Worms. Lowe became Chief Rabbi of Bohemia and Moravia in the 1580s.\nWhile Russia reversed colonization and captured the slave trading post of khanate of Kazan in 1552, the Ottomans took over Cyprus from Venice a year before their fleet was defeated by a League of the Habsburgs, Venice, and the Pope. As the Ottomans refocused towards Persia, King Jagiello of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth sought to access the Baltic and protect Lithuania from Russia by uniting with Livonia. \nConflict arose in 1554 when Livonia allied with Moscow, leading to war with Poland-Lithuania. As Tsar Ivan the Terrible expanded through Lithuania, he took the Belarus town of Polotsk and drowned all the Jews in 1565. Against the Radziwill family\u2019s opposition to a union, Poland and Lithuania confederated by 1569, and finished the war. But as Poland\u2019s Jagiellonian dynasty ended in 1572, the Habsburgs sought to secure the throne until French diplomacy prevailed in the election of the new Polish King.\nHaving experimented with Protestantism, Lithuanian magnate-Prince Radziwill went to repent in Venice, where he met the Chief Rabbi of Venice Katz-descendent Samuel Wahl. While Wahl\u2019s daughters soon married the sons of the Chief Rabbi of Lithuanian Posen, his son Saul became a tax farmer and Court Jew for the King of Poland. After Poland\u2019s King died in 1587, Radziwill was proclaimed the leader, despite a sitting Queen. As he declined, Radziwill proposed Saul, who became King until Parliament elected Sigismund III, nephew of the Polish Queen and son of Sweden King of House Vasa. \nBy 1592, Catholic Sigismund wed Archduchess Anna Habsburg and claimed his Lutheran cousin\u2019s Swedish throne through 1599, moving the Poland\u2019s capital from Krakau north to Warsaw. The Vasa cousins warred over the Baltic until 1660. As Sigismund wed a Habsburg, Catholic Polish lords colonized Lithuanian Ukraine. Spreading using kinterlinks, Radziwill employed Katz and other Lords\u2019 Jews across their lands.\nOriginated from regular meetings of rabbis at the Lublin fair in the 1530s, Polish autonomous Jewish communities established the Council of the Four Lands to centralize governance for for credit and other law in the late 16th century. One of the last judges of Lublin was Solomon Luria, Katz\u2019s cousin-once-removed, whose children married or became chief rabbis. \nIn Protestant lands, Antwerp\u2019s financial laws influenced Amsterdam (1595), Danzig in Poland (1597), England (1602), and Hamburg (1603), with bills circulating widely for mercantile payments by 1600, while Catholic territories increasingly monopolized public banking systems, including Genoa (1586), Venice (1587), Milan (1597), and Rome (1605). \nWithin Spain, a Habsburg King united the parliaments of Castile, Aragon, and Portugal. In Castile\u2014the largest, which housed the King and fairs\u2014Spain granted Aclara Bibaldo, who was connected to both Spanish nobility and Genoese merchants, a ten-year public bank monopoly in 1595. The bank faced challenges and soon failed, leading to its takeover by Genoese banker J\u00e1come Mortedo. In Antwerp, disputes over dry exchange led to restrictive legislation in 1600. \nFinancial instability, including problems within Genoa\u2019s credit system, contributed to the collapse of Mortedo\u2019s bank. In 1602, Genoese bankers Agust\u00edn and Julio Spinola founded a new bank but faced opposition due to its foreign ownership. Despite protests, Spinola\u2019s bank continued operations for several years. Aragon\u2014with public banks monopolies since the 15th century\u2014forbade accounts to coin exchangers in Catalonia (1602) and outlawed exchange off Valencia\u2019s public bank\u2019s books (1604). By 1603, Portugal outlawed the dry exchange to align with Castile.\nThe Portuguese loss of credit soon spread. As Castile legalized dry exchange in 1604. Despite retaining theocratic bigotry with growing calls to expel the Muslim Moriscos, Castille allowed Portuguese Jewish merchants to engage in commerce. As Iberian imports from the Baltic collapsed, merchants in Poland\u2019s Royal Prussian State\u2014housing the Baltic Ports of Danzig and Elbing\u2014failed to convince the Polish King to revalue the currency, they switched their attention to expelling Portuguese Jewish merchants. \nAs Spain expelled Moriscos in 1609, <italic>Bank of Amsterdam</italic> (\u201cAWB\u201d) formed to monopolize banking and the clearing of bills of exchange. With less silver, the King of Poland debased the circulating medium in 1616, creating a safe asset premium for silver and gold coinage. As Portuguese Jews were closely associated with this trade, Royal Prussia closed Danzig to Jews. Although Jews could continue living and operating in the rest of Poland, Danzig merchants were pushed into bankruptcy and the Baltic trade collapsed. To address urgent debt payments, Venice\u2019s wealthiest Jew, Abraham delBanco co-founded <italic>Giro Bank</italic> in 1619. The same year, descendants of Spanish Court Jew Abraham Seneor-Coronel and several other Jewish families help co-found <italic>Bank of Hamburg </italic>in the independent Imperial city.\nAfter fleeing Lisbon and Antwerp from the Inquisition, Sephardi reestablished the spice and diamond industry in Amsterdam. Since Ximines resigned from the spice-trading concession around 1600, Pinto, Tinoco, and other allied families took over. By the late 16th century, Portuguese Tinoco, Silveira, Fernandes, Seneor-Coronel, and Brandao merchant families imported indigo, which they traded for cloth and other commodities in Europe. \nLikewise, the New Christian merchants, including Simao Dias Vaaz, Antonio Paz, and Gil Lopes Pinto in Antwerp, and Bento Osorio and Manuel Dias Henriques in Amsterdam, affiliated with Diogo Mendes in Venice\u2019s diamond trade. The Pinto consolidated their economic power and expanded their trading networks to become Antwerp\u2019s major merchant bankers with strategic marriages to Jeironimo Pacheco, an Old Christian with Spanish trading networks; Affonso Peres Pacheco, an Old Christian gentry connected to the Portuguese Crown; and the Portuguese Postmaster General\u2019s nephew, Jeironimo Oliveira Coronel. \nIn Habsburg Central Europe, meanwhile, since Judah Lowe became Chief Rabbi of Poland in 1588, Mordecai Jaffe returned from Poland to become Chief Rabbi of Bohemia. Like elsewhere in Europe, Prague sought to ban pledge instruments from creating usurious credit. As Austria banned credit pledges and gave Imperial Court Jew Meisel control over gold secured debt claims by 1592. As a border conflict drew Habsburg Austria into conflict with Ottoman Turkey, Rudolf ordered Mint Jew Meisel to produce gold. Amidst the war, as the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova revolted against Turkey, Prince Michael massacred the Jews and Muslims of Bucharest. \nWhen Lowe returned to become Chief Rabbi of Bohemia, Jaffe became Chief Rabbi of Poland from 1599. But as the childless Meisel died, Rudolf voided Meisel\u2019s will and tortured his nephews for their fortune by 1601. Since Meisel\u2019s treasures collateralized circulating pledges, Rudolf forced the rabbis to excommunicate any Jew with illegal pledges, gold, or written documents and did not deposit with the royal treasury. Along with increasing Jews taxes, Prague closed Jewish establishments and arrested Rabbi Lowe and other influential Jews in 1602. Given their penchant for alchemy and mysticism, the Golem oppression myth immortalized the struggle between the Emperor and the Rabbi. \nWhile one of Rabbi Lowe\u2019s daughters married Abraham Wallerstein\u2014whose maternal great-aunt from Frankfurt married an Oppenheim cousin\u2014Wallerstein\u2019s son married Mirel Teomin Frankel, a cousin of the Katz Luria, Krakau\u2019s Court Jew Auerbach family, and a Horowitz\u2014 descended from King David and the Benveniste Court Jews of Aragon, relating him to the Benveniste Mendes family of Antwerp\u2014whose uncle, Samuel Teomin Frankel Munk, became head of the liberated Jewish community in Vienna in 1603. Another of Lowe\u2019s daughters wed Simon Brandeis, the son of a leading Prague merchant and Jewish official, by 1608. \nWhile not even the archbishops of Catholic Cologne could permit residency for his Court Jews since the 15th century, Cologne accepted Calvinist refugees following the sack of Antwerp. By 1608, popular opinion in Cologne led to the expulsion of Protestants, shifting economic activity to Frankfurt and other towns. Johan Deutz, a Cologne merchant, moved to Amsterdam and married Elisabeth Coymans, a Catholic descendant of Flemish aristocrats and an extended cousin of the Medici and Bardi families. \nHowever, after Emperor Rudolph died in 1612, his son moved the Habsburg Court to Vienna. In 1612, Frankfurt expelled its Jews, prompting Oppenheim, the Levite Goldschmidt, and other families to seek new homes. Matthias officially re-admitted Jews to Vienna in 1616.  Likewise, the Austrian P\u00e4lffy counts soon allowed Jews to resettle near Hungarian Pressburg, where they revived trade by distributing textiles from Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, restoring the city\u2019s economic importance.\n\n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>The Panics from the Thirty Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>\nStrategic marriages between the Catholic the Habsburgs of Austria and Germany, Bourbons of France, and notable Italian ducal and Papal families, centralized control of Europe. But as more nobles and descendants of converted Jews embraced Protestantism, France persecution limited such endogamous Huguenots to Cognac\u2019s port of La Rochelle, where commerce thrived.\nAfter English King James\u2019 daughter wed Protestant Frederick V, Elector of Palatinate, in 1613, French Queen Regent Marie Habsburg Medici arranged the marriage of her son King Louis XIII Bourbon to the daughter of Spanish King Phillip III Habsburg, by 1615. In 1618, as Frederick became King of Bohemia, the closure of Protestant churches and the throwing of several Protestant ministers out of the windows of Prague Castle by Catholics precipitated the <italic>Thirty Years War</italic>. \nAs England supported Bohemia, Catholic Spain funded the Huguenots of La Rochelle to revolt against co-religionist France in 1625. While France targeted Spain\u2019s Genoese bankers in Lyons, the eruption of civil war led France to address the Huguenot threat by signing a treaty with Spain, Huguenot tax privileges,<italic> </italic>and political autonomy for La Rochelle. And when King James died in 1625, his son took the crown and wed Louis XIII\u2019s sister. Four years later, Vienna forced a Protestant German banker to flee to Switzerland.\nWith the resumption of the <italic>Dutch-Spanish War</italic> collapsed Mediterranean trade and the import of gold from the Americas. Likewise, Genoa sought the opinion of the Pope on the acceptability of dry exchange under canonical law. Amid declining currency values and growing price difference, Genoa\u2019s <italic>Banco di San Giorgio</italic> created a bank money for Spanish silver coins. By 1626, the Papacy condemned dry exchange and Spain\u2019s financial crisis deepened, causing a run to silver and the inflation of Castilian currency. In 1627, Spain halted payments to creditors and converted money market instruments into long-term debts. As Spain turned more to Portuguese financiers, the golden age of Genoese finance ended. Likewise, another Spanish Habsburg default felled what remained of <italic>Fugger</italic>, pivoting European copper minting to Lutheran Sweden. \nGustav Vasa became the King of Sweden in 1611, displacing his Catholic cousin, King Sigismund III of Poland. As Jewish merchants conducted widespread interest-based lending within their community, the kahal managed credit matters, overseeing all transactions with non-Jews. To control trade and minimize competition among Jewish merchants, the kahals granted exclusive rights to deal with specific non-Jewish customers. They also appointed trade supervisors to protect guilds, including Krakau furriers from 1613. \nBut as Sigismund and his Habsburg-in-laws sought to restore Catholicism in 1617, Gustav conquered Lithuania from Poland. After Lords Radziwill and Sapieha regained control in 1621, they signed a truce in 1622. After the conflict reignited in 1625, Gustav crushed Sapieha in 1626 with minimal losses, and challenged the Habsburgs in Germany by 1630, strategically aligning with France to achieve a truce. After the war, the cruelty of some Lords led Poland\u2019s Diet to ban Christian violence against Jewish debtors in 1633. With little success, leadership of the kahal shifted from merchants to Lords\u2019 Jews connected to influential magnates.\nAlthough Court Jews had existed for centuries a new era began as warring states needed Court Jews from Germany to Turkey. Amidst violence in 1619, the Emperor protected 50 families in Frankfurt. With marriages restricted to twelve a year, other discriminations against these Protected Jews included higher tax rates than Christians, social and economic exclusion and enclosure in a ghetto, while guilds and local laws limited their career options and pushed them into riskier moneylending and commerce. \nFrankfurt resident descendants include Goldschmidt, Kann, Landa, Rothschild, Schiff, and other families. The Kanns were the wealthiest Jews of Frankfurt, later branching into Stern, Beer, and Haas families. After several generations in a house with a ship (or a vial), a Kann adopted the surname Schiff before moving to a house with a green shield, near with a red shield, where the Hahns adopted the surname Rothschild.\nProtected Jews also settled along manor to village trade routes. Since the 16th century, Jews in Eastern Europe played a pivotal role in the region\u2019s agricultural trade networks, exporting Moldavan cattle fattened in Ukraine, Hungarian wine, and Lithuanian grain to markets in Silesia, West German lands, and France. Jewish traders participated prominently in the grain trade in Galicia and Russian Poland during the 19th century, despite official attempts to restrict their activities. Primogeniture-type laws limited the ability to marry and own property to the eldest, perpetuating socio-economic marginalization within the Jewish community, and incentivizing migration. While Isaac Goldschmidt\u2019s grandson Joseph settled in Hameln to sell diamonds after expulsion, Joseph\u2019s cousin Benedict became a Court Jew of Kassel. The descendants of Benedict that returned to Frankfurt remained Goldschmidt, and those that moved to Amsterdam became Goldsmid. \nA relative of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and Krakau\u2019s Court Jews and Parnas, Luria cousin Israel Auerbach became Vienna\u2019s tax farmer and top taxpayer in 1616, followed closely by their Teomin Frankel Munk cousins. The families also kinterlinked with Prague Court Jew Jacob Bassevi, as he became Parnas of Prague in 1616. During the revolt, King Frederick of Bohemia\u2019s Protestant supporters pillaged Prague\u2019s Jewish quarter due to the Jews\u2019 loyalty to the Habsburgs. In contrast, Emperor Ferdinand chose not to expel the Jews from Vienna. Instead, in 1620, he leased Vienna\u2019s mint to the Jews as part of his efforts to raise revenue. \nAfter the Imperial forces, including Prince Gundaker Liechtenstein, defeated the Bohemian Protestant rebels in 1620, Emperor Ferdinand expelled Protestant nobles and appropriated their estates. Jacob Bassevi, who had raised funds for Imperial General Albrecht Wallenstein with Calvinist Antwerp-born banker Jan Witte by distributing debased coinage across Germany, was granted a coat of arms by Ferdinand, though he was not ennobled due to his Jewish faith. While protecting Jews from Protestant unrest, Ferdinand imposed trade and currency exchange restrictions on Jews in Silesia. \nEmperor Ferdinand granted Bohemia and Moravia to Liechtenstein, who employed Synger and other Moravian Jews to collect taxes, he married Elizabeth Lucretia\u2014a Piast heiress who descended from a second cousin of one of J\u00e1nos Ernuszt\u2019s wives\u2013who took power after he died. While Lucretia relied on Synger, her family line died with her, and the Habsburgs took over. Accused and imprisoned for coin offenses, Israel Auerbach subsequently became Vienna\u2019s Mint Jew in 1624. By 1632, Vienna had over 68 Court Jews, including the Sephardi Abraham Morpurgo and Court Jewess Leonore Gerstlin. \nAlthough Bassevi earned less than Liechtenstein and Wallenstein, a commission confiscated his assets in 1633 for coin offenses before Wallenstein intervened to protect him. After Wallenstein was assassinated in 1634, Bassevi's assets were seized, and he died insolvent later that year as his children left Prague. Since Sweden entered the war in 1630, however, Bassevi\u2019s cousin-in-law Koppel Frankel fled Franken to Vienna\u2014marrying a Katz-after his wife died\u2014and became Vienna\u2019s richest Jew as Auerbach banked the Empress. While the Jews engaged primarily in banking, Liechtenstein\u2019s niece married a Fugger in 1636.\nThe rise of international maritime commerce also fueled piracy. Between 1550 and 1730, around a million White Europeans were enslaved in the North Africa, cities such as Algiers, Morocco, Tripoli, and Tunis, challenging international trade as the Barbary pirates regularly sold captured sailors who were unable to raise the necessary ransoms. Through legal pluralism, African slavery entered English America. As English pirates captured Portuguese ships out of Ndongo in 1619, <italic>Virginia Co</italic> brought the first slaves. \nHaving treated indentures as chattels, English courts continued to do so for slaves, with little consideration for Blackness for decades. Indeed, while France and England continued the ban Jews, several Blacks found meaning between the 15th and 16th centuries. Outside of extremes, Blacks work ranged from royal trumpeting to silk-weaving. Meanwhile, Portugal and Ndongo began a trade war over slaves and land. Of royal Mbundu families, Ndongo\u2019s king battled Portugal, while his sister, Nzinga, arrived as an emissary on his behalf around 1621, and became Catholic. After her brother\u2019s death in 1624, Nzinga claimed his title with Portugal\u2019s help. \nMeanwhile, the global network of Sephardi diasporas, for a time centered in Venice, Salonica, and elsewhere in Turkey, grew from 1609. Since expulsion, Spanish Muslim Moriscos moved to Morocco. While refusing Spanish advances, discontent with the rule of the sultan of Marrakesh led Moriscos and Jews to rebel in the late 1620s, forming a self-governing pirate republic. Started in 1621 with Sephardi participation, <italic>Dutch West </italic><italic>Indies Co</italic> (\u201cGWC\u201d) colonized the region from Delaware and New York in 1624, and conquered Spain\u2019s gold, slave, and sugar cross-Atlantic trades. \nAlso that year, the \u2018New Christian\u2019 Diego Teixeira of Portugal became paymaster of the King of Spain in Antwerp and married a descendant of the converted Court Jew of Spain Abraham Seneor. In New Spain, Spanish-born converso Simon Vaez traded silk between Seville and Lisbon until settling in New Spain in 1618. \nHe joined the Mexico City merchant guild and extended credit across New Spain, including mining towns such as Zacatecas, Guadiana, Cuencam\u00e9, and Potos\u00ed. His trade involved cloth from Tlaxcala, Toledo, Sevilla, and Asia, along with goods such as saffron, sugar, cinnamon, and mules. His house in Mexico City functioned as a transit point for incoming crypto-Jews from the 1620s, establishing a family-based trade network connecting Holland, France, Goa, the Philippines, Peru, and Venezuela. \nBut when the Inquisition prosecuted gold trading Jews in 1636, Spain weakened as the Dutch attracted Mocatta, Henriques, and other Sephardi with religious autonomy. Continuing to limit Jewish settlement and employment opportunities for decades, the Dutch also marginalized Catholics politically, who were barred from public office and faced restrictions on religious practices.\nNearby, the Chinese \u2018sugar frontier\u2019 on the North Java coast was predated by massive Hokkien migrations to Taiwan from the early 17th century. Sugar growing led to a constant demand for credit from land-hungry cultivators. The settlers evolved the fund-pooling cooperative, which became the rotating credit pool of Hokkien Chinese businessmen, typical of mainland Chinese middle-class. \nSince China\u2019s Ming dynasty revived paper currency, American silver and the <italic>Panic of 1620</italic>, China abolished the depreciated banknotes and silver became dominant in China. As Sephardi acted as intermediaries in the China-Japan exchange, they likely taught Nuremberg\u2019s copper refining techniques to Ribei Tomomochi of Japan. By 1623, Tomomochi founded what became <italic>Sumitomo</italic>, allowing Japan soon challenging Sweden in copper exports to India. \nThe decline of the Ming dynasty in the early 17th century resulted from government bankruptcy, floods, droughts, and a drop in silver imports. Peasant rebellions sparked wars that ended the Ming dynasty. A \u2018little ice age\u2019 caused food shortages and led to gangs scouring the countryside for food. The Ming government increased taxes, leading to more hardships. Rebel leaders competed to establish new dynasties, causing violent looting by 1627. \nAmidst civil war, China evacuated the coasts, decreasing the import of Japanese copper. So, as silver inflated against copper, Japan produced less copper. A decline in production and a slowdown in the money supply contributed to the economic slowdown in Japan from late 1630 into the 1640s. The government\u2019s decision to remove copper coins from circulation destabilized the silver-copper exchange rate. \nIn Gujarat, India, seths\u2014hereditary merchant-bankers\u2014continued to provide credit. Like the Jewish Kohanim, the priestly Brahmin caste valued scholarly pursuits and \u2018bookishness\u2019 and have a long history in finance and government. By the early 16th century, Malik Gupi, a governing Brahmin of Surat, had significant economic influence, and his son became a considerable merchant. With strong connections with the state, Brahmin provided credit to nobles and officials through the 17th century. As Hindu and Jain families organized guilds along Jain and Hindu religions and castes, they funded the Dutch in 1630. \nSince the Dutch arrived in Japan and discredited the Spanish in 1624 and Portuguese in 1636, a new Kanto lord centralized feudalism, allowing the Dutch to monopolize Western trade. As Japan\u2019s civil wars and famine ended, banks developed and interest rates caps fell below 20%. While the Portuguese and EIC dominated the Mediterranean coral and Indian diamond trade, VOC and Amsterdam overtook the monopolies. After Portugal regained independence in 1640, the Portuguese became significant competitors by supplying the coral market of Western India. London\u2019s diamond trade suffered as the Portuguese Crown shifted shipments from Lisbon to Amsterdam along a Sephardi network spanning Amsterdam, Livorno, Lisbon, and Goa. \nWhile the Dutch VOC took control of Malacca from Portugal in 1641, GWC seized Ndongo\u2019s capital from Portugal, allaying with Nzinga to monopolize the slave trade. Increasingly, Portugal granted prazos\u2014land grants\u2014to European, Indian, and mixed-race overlords control over local Africans and slaves as Portuguese settlers moved inland from the Mozambican coast. \nIn 1631, Portugal supported King Muenemutapa. By 1644, Pedro Pereira acquired Prazo Makanga from a local chief after assisting in a revolt, consolidating his control through strategic marriages and managing slaves. Similarly, Sisnando Bayao received Prazo Cheringoma from King Berenha in 1640 for military assistance and married a local chief\u2019s daughter. Prazeros like Pereira and Bayao, through marriage and kinship, secured significant local power and autonomy.\nWhile England continued implementing a brutal bankruptcy process and ever-increasing taxation, Scotland experienced relative prosperity. Soon King Charles and the Anglican Bishop Laud sought to impose the English system of worship on the Scot clergy and sought to expropriate Scot nobility\u2019s formerly monastic estates. In addition to the threat for individual property rights, this undermined the credit system secured by the estates. The following year, the Scots revolted against England with support from Scottish royal Colonel David Barclay and, soon after, the Scot Parliament reformed estate mortgages into movable bonds. \nIn England, tax collection fell as courts filled with default proceedings<italic>.</italic> In England, goldsmiths stabilized the exchange rates by melting heavy coins and exporting them to Amsterdam when profitable. King Charles ended this process in 1627 and revived older practice of a royal monopoly on the exchange of gold and silver. While some goldsmiths accepted deposits of money and plate in trust, most used the <italic>Royal</italic> <italic>Mint</italic> as a repository. Facing insolvency by 1640, King Charles sought loans from Parliament, London, the Pope, Spain, France, and Genoa. All refused.<italic> </italic>\nTo raise his army, the King dissolved Parliament and seized the gold in the <italic>Royal</italic> <italic>Mint</italic>, precipitating the <italic>Panic of 1640</italic>. That fall, Ireland joined Scotland in revolt against the Crown as King Charles\u2019 Lord Deputy of Ireland expropriated estates that the Irish lost to English merchants through bankruptcy. With higher interest rates, usury-hating Calvinists soon led the revolt in England. Amidst the crisis, the King married his nine-year-old daughter, Mary Stuart, to the son of Dutch Stadholder Stadtholder Fredrik of Orange, and borrowed significant funds from the Rotterdam.\nThe Civil War across the British Isles curbed colonial labor in the <italic>Panic of 1640</italic> in America. Since the rich held most slaves, Virginia began taxing Black labor over indentures and land. The crisis particularly effected women. After America\u2019s first witch suspicion in 1645, Connecticut executed the first \u2018witch\u2019 in 1647. That year, Massachusetts replaced primogeniture with partible inheritance\u2014shrinking estates and servitude\u2014and allowed unrecorded chattel transfers. Caribbean sugar planters bought Black slaves instead. While slaves offered loan collateral and breeding profits, low-debt free labor allowed diversification. With different religious financing law, Arab slave traders castrated males to prevent reproduction and sold females for sex.\nFollowing years of war, Colonel Daniel Barclay of Scotland married Catherine Gordon, a fellow descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and a Calvinist cousin of the English Stuart dynasty in 1648, and the untied Parliamentary army defeated King Charles and executed him in 1649. By 1653, the Puritan <italic>Commonwealth</italic> gained power under Oliver Cromwell. Defaulting on Crown debt and seizing coal lands, <italic>Commonwealth</italic>\u2019s insolvency reform freed debt prisoners. Since the King looted the <italic>Royal Mint</italic> in 1640, <italic>Backwell</italic> and other goldsmiths supported Cromwell and multiplied<italic>.</italic><italic></italic> Despite proposals for a Dutch-type central bank, goldsmiths reposited gold and issued circulating notes. \nWhile Barclay\u2019s son Robert served in Cromwell\u2019s Parliament, Cromwell\u2019s sister married the leader of the Welsh forces, John Jones, who condemned Charles to death in 1649, in 1656. Against the Dutch and French, Parliament enacted <italic>Navigation Acts</italic> as the expedition of 1651 reduced Dutch influence and displaced royalists from Barbados, allowing the Sephardim to takeover. England\u2019s overseas trade grew with London\u2019s Sephardim as Cromwell re-admitted Jews. One of the earliest was David Brandon, a co-founder of <italic>Bank of Hamburg</italic>.\nBy 1644, nomadic Qing of Manchuria overthrew the Ming, the last Han to rule China. As they privatized land, conditional land sales helped secure credit. Since this process removed the need for land banks, remittances grew. Descended from Confucius, Hsun-chang Kung banned his heirs from government service. So, his son established a remittance service out of Shansi with correspondents in Peking, Canton, and Japan. \nAs the Dutch tariffed Indonesian trade, VOC banned slaves, mixed-race people, and their spouses from travel to Europe in 1644. Since the Governor General of the Dutch East Indies promoted marriages between Dutch settlers and baptized local women in 1612, VOC allowed time-expired employees to settle in Asia, trade freely, and marry Asian women. Likewise, Batavian authorities barred Asian clerks from employment from 1672.\nWhile Spanish domains from Sicily, Naples, and Palermo to Catalonia and Portugal revolted by 1648, uprisings followed in Austria, France, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland. Ibrahim of Turkey and Charles of England and Scotland were executed within a year. Finally, the Habsburgs ended the German <italic>Thirty Years\u2019 War</italic> and Dutch<italic> Eighty Years\u2019 War</italic>. \nUnlike the <italic>Peace of Augsburg</italic> in 1555, the <italic>Treaty of Westphalia</italic> extended Calvinist legal protections and allowed German states to form alliances. Portugal seceded from Spain, taking with her Moroccan Tangier. As Portugal\u2019s treaty with England in 1654 allowed for direct trade of English wool for Portuguese sugar from Brazil, the Dutch withdrew from Brazil and Ndongo. Without local support, Queen Nzinga made concessions to Portugal to control the land and slave trade until her death in 1663. After her successors started a war, Portugal colonized Ndongo. \nMany of Spain\u2019s enemies received financing from Court Jews. In France, the \u2018Fournisseurs du Roi\u2019 were predominantly Jews or New Christians of Jewish descent. In 1656, Louis XIV issued decrees to Bayonne and Bordeaux, ensuring protection for Portuguese merchants in these regions. Within a year, he protected the Jews of Alsace and Lorraine, which he absorbed in 1648. With encouragement from his Finance Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert, he declared Marseilles a free port, allowing Jews from Leghorn to settle there, against local merchant opposition. During this time, Jews were also authorized to establish communities in the French Caribbean colonies of Martinique and Cayenne.\nIn the Netherlands, Jews equipped Maurice of Nassau\u2019s armies. And during Portugal\u2019s revolution, Joseph DaCosta Villareal held the rank of \u2018Providetore General.\u2019 However, the intensified persecution of Portuguese New Christians by the Inquisition and decline of Spanish Antwerp caused many Sephardim to migrate to Amsterdam, including those returning from Dutch Brazil. This influx fostered advancements in industries such as sugar refining, diamond cutting, and tobacco processing. \nIn 1642, that officials had been sent from Mexico City to Veracruz and Tierra Adentro to enforce royal edicts expelling Portuguese residents and to confiscate Portuguese property. During the Inquisition, most defendants were kin-linked merchants rather than a distinct occupational group. While some relatives of converso Simon Vaez were arrested it was not until the 1649 <italic>auto de fe</italic> that Inquisition officials ordered him and his family to sail from Veracruz to Spain.\nBy 1646, the Pinto merchant banking family, the wealthiest of the European northern diaspora, fled Antwerp for Holland due to threats from the Spanish governor. While Rachel Pinto married the wealthy Isaac Pereira, his death led her to wed Antonio Lopes Suasso in 1653. Suasso\u2019s parents were the doctor Francisco Lopes and Isabel Mendes Sotto, who settled in Bordeaux. While Suasso\u2019s brothers pursued medicine, academia, and commerce and sisters wed Henriques, Sotto, and Dias heirs, Suasso traded wool with his uncle Antonio Dias Frances, connecting Spain and Amsterdam. Suasso joined the Pinto and Henriques families to engage with VOC.\nAlthough Spanish Catholics had long traded, dynamics shifted without the Sephardim. The Americas trade evolved as Basque and military knights secured noble titles, intra-marrying with native Mexican families, and establishing extensive kinship networks, which controlled mining, public funds, livestock, and plantations. Without Dutch protection, Portugal expelled Jews from Brazil. While some fled to New York, others to Jamaica or Cura\u00e7ao, where they farmed or traded slaves for Spain with <italic>Dutch West Indies Co</italic> (\u201cGWC\u201d). Still, Jews played a negligible role in the Black slave economy.\nSince the <italic>Eighty Years\u2019 War</italic> ended, Spanish Belgians could only trade within the Spanish Empire. So, the Austrian Habsburgs retained mixed Dutch bankers. Descended from Belgian aristocrats and an extended cousin of the Medici and Bardi families, Elisabeth Coymans married Amsterdam merchant Johan Deutz of Cologne in 1614. In 1638, Deutz died, leaving Elisabeth to manage their estate and children, including Jean. After Elisabeth died in 1653, Jean married the daughter of wealthy and influential Jan Bicker, who became Mayor of Amsterdam that year and as his other son-in-law, politician Johan DeWitt, prospered.\nAlso in 1614, Elisabeth Coymans\u2019 cousin married into the aristocratic Calvinist Wilhem family of Amsterdam and Hamburg. As the Dutch granted VOC<italic> </italic>a monopoly, the Wilhems gained a charter from the King of Denmark for <italic>Danish East </italic><italic>Indies</italic><italic> Co</italic><italic> </italic>in 1616, receiving a twelve-year trade monopoly. Dutch Calvinists like the Wilhems became the leading capitalist elite in Lutheran Denmark, participating in the Danish monopoly on trade with Iceland from 1619 and aborted companies for trade with Spain and France. \nIn 1625, the Wilhems received permission to establish <italic>Danish West </italic><italic>Indies </italic><italic>Co</italic>, but the venture failed. They also supplied weapons to the Danish crown during the <italic>Kalmar War</italic> and the <italic>Thirty Years\u2019 War</italic>, held licenses for whaling off Norway and Greenland, operated a lime kiln near Malm\u00f6, ran a silk manufactory from 1624 to 1627, and conducted trade in grain and fats on crown estates.\nMerchant Balthasar Spinelli Coymans\u2014Elisabeth\u2019s father\u2014had the second-largest fortune in Amsterdam in 1631, and his daughter married Joan Coymans Huydecoper in 1624. Huydecoper\u2019s sister married a Dutch merchant who traded Swedish copper\u2014whose cousin was a burgomaster and director of VOC\u2014and their son Willem Kieft traded wine. The Coymans also kinterlinked with a sister of Elias Raedt, a merchant and director of GWC.  Upon Elias\u2019 proposal, Kieft became Director of New Netherland in 1637. Kieft\u2019s brothers-in-law included Coenraet Ceulen, with whom Raedt acquired a tract of land on Manhattan in 1640.\nElisabeth Coymans\u2019 first cousin once removed, Isaac Coymans, was involved in GWC trade. He participated in Gold Coast trading operations and maintained extensive commercial networks. In 1657, Hendrick Caerloff, previously active with <italic>Swedish Africa Co</italic>, switched allegiance to lead a Danish expedition in West Africa, dislodging Swedish positions. Two years later, Caerloff established <italic>Gl\u00fcckstadt Co</italic> in Amsterdam to conduct trade under Danish licenses, with Coymans investing and playing an active role in planning and operations. \nThat year, Coymans\u2019 correspondence warning <italic>Gl\u00fcckstadt </italic>of a potential GWC attack on Danish positions was intercepted, resulting in his conviction for treason. While he was fined, sentenced to six years in prison, and exiled from the Dutch Republic and GWC territories, Caerloff avoided charges by cooperating with GWC. Jean Coymans Deutz, however, became <italic>Imperial Factor of Mercury</italic> for Spanish silver mining in 1659 As security for his loans to the Emperor.\nBack in 1648, Bogdan Chmielnicki, a noble from Ruthenian Ukraine, led the Cossacks against the Polish nobility. After defeating the Polish army, Chmielnicki joined with the peasantry to murdered over 100,000 Jews by 1656. Allying with Russia in 1654, hundreds of thousands more were slaughtered as Russia battled Sweden for control of Poland. Among the victims were Marcus Bassevi and Katz-descendant Ben Meisel \u201cWulff\u201d, who had to convert before rebuilding his shattered life in Hamburg. The Chmielnicki Massacre led Jews to flee to Turkish Wallachia, where they faced antisemitism. While Greek Orthodox churches labeled Jews as heretics, forbidding interactions and court testimony, Ottoman rule re-admitted Jews with privileges. \nDuring the siege of Lemberg, Orthodox Christians and Cossacks pillaged Catholics nobles and murdered almost half the city\u2019s Jewry. While Cossacks demanded all Jews, the Poles refused. This refusal was due to the Polish armies defending the city and their desire to maintain economic and communal ties as they had for centuries. Under Polish protection, Court Jews continued to borrow from non-Jewish Lords to intermediate credit. Among the largest was Jakubek the Wealthy in late 16th-century Krakau and Kazimierz, served as a community elder and co-authored the 1595 Krakau kahal statute. \nHis son, Izaak, signed the 1609 treaty on Jewish-Christian trade, served as a community elder, and held office in the Council of Four Lands. Izaak wed a sister of Rabbi Abraham Rapoport of Lemberg, and their son Moj\u017cesz worked with his father in securing loans from Christian nobles, owned property in Kazimierz, operated shops, and managed a lending business using family and borrowed funds. Izaak\u2019s daughter married the rector of the Krakau yeshiva a descendant of Solomon Luria\u2019s sister. Abraham Rappaport\u2019s great wealth allowed him to head the yeshiva of Lemberg and preside over the Council of Four Lands. After Abraham\u2019s death, his son wed former King Saul Katz Wahl\u2019s daughter in 1651.\nSince Poland\u2019s Diet forbade Christians from using violence against Jewish debtors in 1633, they fixed different profit rates for native Christian traders (7%), foreigners (5%), and Jews (3%) in 1643. By 1654, Russian forces defeated Radziwill and gained a firm grip on Polish Lithuania. As Charles X Vasa attacked Poland and Russia in 1655 to secure Sweden\u2019s Baltic empire. \nAmidst the war, Poland\u2019s Diet had to reissue the 1633 ban Christians from using violence against Jewish debtors in 1658. Despite some military successes, peace negotiations with Russia were challenging, until Charles died in 1660, and his successor refocused Sweden to domestic issues. While Radziwill continued warring with Lords Pac for another century, their conflict with Sapieha in 1700 weakened of their power. So did battles between did Lords Potockis and Czartoryski over the 18th century.\nMeanwhile, Austria expanded into Southeastern Europe. By the early 17th century, Turkey incorporated Hungary, Syria, Iraq, and Egypt, benefiting the state finances to pay for additional janissary expenses. However, the Ottomans faced increased competition form Safavid Persia. And ships transported more goods and gold as EIC and Dutch companies disrupted the Silk Road caravans. \nWith growing gold scarcity in Turkey through the 1620s, defeat in Poland and calls for political reform led the janissaries to assassinate the Sultan in 1621. As Safavid Persia invited EIC and VOC against Turkey, the Ottomans won Crete from Venice during the <italic>Thirty Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, Turkey invaded Transylvania in 1660 and soon Podolia in present-day Ukraine, redirecting the Habsburg\u2019s ire from the Protestants to Muslims.\nAs French King Louis XIV, the son of French King Henry IV Bourbon and Queen Marie Habsburg Medici, married the sister of Spanish King Carlos II Habsburg in 1660, Louis\u2019 cousin Charles II, the son of English King Charles and Henrietta Medici Bourbon, reclaimed the English throne with the aid of royalists, including Sephardi Augustin Coronel Chacon, a relative of the Mendes and DaCosta families. \nLikewise, Abrabanel descendants arrived and kinterlinked with the Mendes and Ximenes families. Executing John Jones and other traitors, King Charles repudiated <italic>Commonwealth</italic> debt and law, the legal changes shocked Scot credit, the Crown deflected public fury by inciting witch hunts. During this chaos, some descendants of the Huguenot Houblon family\u2014who had Anglicized their surname to Hope\u2014fled Scotland for Amsterdam. \nWhile keeping primogeniture, English law provided strict settlement for daughters and younger sons and protection of wives\u2019 property rights. He allowed the Jews to remain. David Brandon\u2019s son soon held the exclusive right of acting as tobacco broker in London. Likewise, at the suggestion of Augustin Coronel Chacon, the King married John IV of Portugal\u2019s daughter, who brought several members of the Mendes family, descendants of the Duke of Naxos. As part of the dowry, Portugal gave the Port of Bombay to England.  Also gaining Moroccan Tangier from Portugal, England kept Sephardi Pariente as the Court Jews of Morocco. \nDespite the <italic>Act of Toleration</italic> since the Restoration, English and Scottish Quakers engaged in farming, industry, trade, and banking as their refusal to take oaths barred them from politics, law, and military. In 1662, England imprisoned Charles Lloyd for a decade for refusing certain oaths. Linked to European aristocracy as Lords of the Dolobran estate in Wales, the Lloyd family descended from Emperor Charlemagne and the kings of Dyfed. \nCharles and his brother Thomas were the initial Quakers within the family. Following his release, Charles Lloyd returned to Dolobran, where he remained devoted to Quakerism. His eldest son later took over the estate and established iron furnaces. The second son moved to Birmingham and opened an iron warehouse. Thomas, however, later moved to Pennsylvania. \nFrom the British Isles to the North American colonies, endogamous Quaker entrepreneurs Macy, Cadbury, and Darby families gradually developed British commerce, ironworks and American whale oil, which was dominated by the frequently interlinked English Russell and Howland families by the 18th century after facing adversity. Fleeing English religious pressures in the 1620s, Henry Howland settled in Plymouth Colony. By 1633, he became a landowner and freeman and was among the original purchasers of Dartmouth from the Wampanoag in 1652. \nWhen he converted to Quakerism in 1657, Plymouth authorities disfranchised him and confiscated his property. Likewise, Quakers ascended in banking. Since Thomas Smyth established the private <italic>Bank of Nottingham</italic> in the 1650s, John Freame, the son of a Quaker textile merchant of Gloucestershire apprenticed to goldsmith Bolton in the 1660s. And after Colonel Daniel Barclay was imprisoned for becoming a Quaker, his son with Catherine Gordon, Robert Gordon Barclay, soon saw opportunity and became a proprietor and Governor of East New Jersey. \nFour years after becoming an <italic>Exchequer</italic> auditor in 1664, Sidney Godolphin, a Cornwall-born descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, mediated between English King Charles II and his sister Henrietta Anne, who was married to their cousin Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, brother of French King Louis XIV, negotiating for Charles II to switch alliances from the Dutch to receive financial support from France. Louis also had ambitions on the territories of his brother-in-law, the King of Spain, who grew close to the Dutch. \nIn 1671, to join his cousin Louis against the Dutch and Spanish in the <italic>Franco</italic><italic>-Dutch War</italic>, Charles set off panic by suspending <italic>Exchequer</italic> payouts, leading to the collapse of <italic>Backwell</italic> and other goldsmiths in the <italic>Panic of 1672</italic>. Replacing a failed predecessor, England chartered <italic>English</italic> <italic>African Co</italic> (\u201cEAC\u201d) to monopolize the gold and slave trade (but profits invited pirates.) Despite reclaiming New York, the Dutch ceded it to England for peace. Refocusing, King Louis seized the iron and coal rich Saarland in Germany. \nLike the French and other Europeans, the Habsburgs continued to rely on Dutch Christians for trade and Jews for war finance. For financing the anti-French coalition, including payments for Admiral Michiel Ruyter\u2019s Dutch fleet to aid Sicily, Spain granted Since Antonio Lopes Suasso a barony. \nSince Emperor Leo Habsburg appointed Jean Coymans Deutz as <italic>Imperial Factor of Mercury</italic> in Amsterdam from 1659, Deutz\u2019s cousin, Dutch banker Baltasar Coymans II, acted as agent, financier, and organizer for French Indies ventures\u2014led by Finance Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert\u2019s company from 1664 with service by <italic>Swedish Africa Co</italic>\u2019s Hendrick Caerloff\u2014and took control of the <italic>asiento</italic> in 1667 with support from GWC and Cura\u00e7ao until his death in 1686. After Jean died in 1673, his widow, continued his business and financing the Emperor. \nIn 1667, another Coymans cousin married diplomat James Boreel, who served as an ambassador to Russia in 1664 before engaging in peace treaties with France. James\u2019 father had served as an ambassador to Venice, Sweden, England, and France after representing VOC in disputes with EIC, for which he was knighted by King James I in 1619. However, the Indies ventures faced competition. In 1670, Colbert attempted to purchase the Danish post at Dansborg on the Malabar coast for France. After negotiations failed, Denmark chartered the second <italic>Danish East Indi</italic><italic>es</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Co</italic> and <italic>Danish West Indi</italic><italic>es Co </italic>by 1671.\nFrom 1665, the Emperor engaged his Court Jew Koppel Frankel to finance the deposed Voivode of Moldova, Greek Albanian George Ghica, using pledged jewels. By 1660, Ghica ruled as the Prince of Moldova and Wallachia, with his successors appointed princes of the regions by the Ottomans. However, the Vienna ghetto faced constant threats from the influential Count Kollonitz and the Empress. In 1669, the Emperor expelled the Jews. As the ghetto was liquidated, Jews collectively shouldered the debt. Frankel\u2019s sons paid debts using Ghica\u2019s jewels and paid for upkeep of the Jewish cemetery. When Vienna\u2019s Jewish community vanished in 1670, the Frankels moved to F\u00fcrth near Nuremberg with the Emperor\u2019s recommendation.\nAs war with Turkey broke out, Emperor Leo contracted new Court Jews. Since Austria gained Bohemia from the Liechtenstein family, Hirschel and Synger families supplied the Breslau Imperial Mint with silver from 1673. Similarly, the Emperor selected Wolf Schlesinger\u2014a grandson of one of Vienna\u2019s earliest Jews\u2014as Mint and Court Jew to supply to Habsburg Army in Hungary. For Imperial Court Jew, the Emperor chose Katz-cousin Samuel Oppenheim, formerly the army contractor for the Palatinate Elector and a correspondent of Frankfort\u2019s <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>. Much of Oppenheim\u2019s legion of Jewish agents and correspondents, many of whom were his relatives, spanned from London to Venice. \nSamuel\u2019s father Simon\u2019s parents\u2014Josef, a silk trader and wealthiest Jew of Frankfurt, and Frumet, a Katz-cousin and fourth cousin twice removed of Josel of Rosheim\u2014were expelled from Frankfurt in 1612. While some Oppenheims later returned to Frankfurt, Simon became Parnas of Worms. While Simon\u2019s sons Abraham married Katz-descendant Blume Wahl and later became Parnas of Worms, his extended cousin (and Josel of Rosheim\u2019s third great-granddaughter) wed Katz-cousin Michael Speyer and moved to Frankfurt. \nSamuel\u2019s cousin kinterlinked into the Kanns of Frankfurt. His most successful employee was Worms-born Samson Wertheim, who married Veronica\u2014the daughter of Samuel\u2019s aunt and Manheim Rabbi Brillin\u2014after the death of her first husband, Samuel\u2019s son Nathan. Within two years, Samuel\u2019s cousin married the granddaughter of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe. A descendant of Rabbi Loew\u2019s brother, Chief Rabbi of Moravia Gabriel Eskeles worked closely with Samuel\u2019s son, David, and around 1685, married a Katz. \nAs Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s nephew David\u2014a son of brother Abraham and Katz-descendant Blume Wahl\u2014and Moravia\u2019s Chief Rabbi married the daughter of Hannover\u2019s Lipman Cohen-Behrens by 1690, Cohen-Behrens\u2019 son wed Wertheim\u2019s daughter. While Cohen-Behrens married Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s daughter of Frankfurt, Joseph\u2019s granddaughter wed Cohen-Behrens\u2019 cousin Johann Liebman, whose brother was the Chief Rabbi of Brandenburg and kinterlinked with the Frankels in Berlin. \nLikewise, Joseph\u2019s son married Glikl Pinkerle of Altona and Glikl\u2019s sister concurrently married a Goldschmidt cousin. Glikl\u2019s father was Altona\u2019s second wealthiest Jew after Hamburg Parnas Haim F\u00fcrst, a descendant of Spanish Court Jew Abraham Seneor-Coronel through the Henriques family. (Joseph\u2019s other son married the Galician Rabbi of Lemberg\u2019s daughter and their daughter wed the son of Katz descendant Ben Meisel Wulff, who had fled Poland during the Chmielnicki Massacre.)\nSince the Sephardi New Christian Teixeira family moved from Spanish Antwerp to become Denmark\u2019s Court Jew, the Danish King captured Altona in 1640 and positioned it as a competitor to Hamburg. By 1647, Senior Teixeira returned to Judaism and became the Queen of Sweden\u2019s Hamburg agent from 1655. After Copenhagen Court Jew Gabriel Gomez convinced the King to allow Sephardi to enter Denmark from 1657, Hamburg Parnas Nathaniel F\u00fcrst\u2014Haim\u2019s son\u2014signed a compact between Hamburg and Altona Jews in 1665. \nWithin two years, Denmark King\u2019s allowed Altona\u2019s Protected Jews to enter. In 1680, Haim F\u00fcrst\u2019s son Solomon\u2014who also became Hamburg Parnas\u2014married a Katz Wulff descendant. By 1683, almost a dozen Ashkenazi families lived in Copenhagen, including a Goldschmidt who kinterlinked with the F\u00fcrst family. As Court Jews Gabriel Milan converted, he became Governor of the Island of Saint-Thomas in the Danish West Indies in 1684 (before being executed for corruption and abuse of office in 1689.)\nAlthough at lower rates than during the Medieval era, women, particularly widows, continued to be active bankers. Religion was often intertwined. For example, Brazil\u2019s sole nunnery from 1677 to 1733, <italic>Desterro Convent</italic>, catered exclusively to Bahia\u2019s Catholic elite and served a dual role. It was not just a religious retreat but also a key financial institution. \nElite families often sent their daughters to the convent as an alternative to marriage. The abbess oversaw financial operations, and some nuns engaged in financial activities, amassing considerable wealth. The convent\u2019s role in society was complex, reflecting both religious and secular functions. While its activities were specific to a select social group, they may have mirrored broader societal norms, suggesting that women from various backgrounds had multifaceted roles in colonial Brazil.\nAlong with bankruptcy procedures for debt, divorces remained expensive and limited in England, with wife sales and public auctions being a popular means of separation. Mimicking livestock sales and exchanging money, this method allowed couples to circumvent the costly legal separation procedures. Vienna specifically permitted Protestant widows to continue their husbands\u2019 business in 1653 and again in 1664. Jewish wives worked with their husbands or independently when widowed. \nLike her coral selling fore-mothers in Poland, Glikl was a merchant. Engaged at twelve, wed at fourteen, and with fourteen children, Glikl participated in her husband\u2019s business and spiritual life. As was customary, she did not attend fairs until she became a widow, and then with her fifteen-year-old son. Before and after her husband died, Glikl arranged marriages for some of her twelve children with Court Jews, including Elias Gomperz\u2019s son, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s daughter, and Wertheim\u2019s niece. As the Court Jew of the Elector of Brandenburg, Elias Gomperz served as the director of German Imperial Mints and established a bank and branching to Vienna, Rome, and Constantinople. Elias\u2019 other daughter wed Lipman Cohen-Behrens\u2019 son.\nOut of the thousands of Court Jews, several women attained prominence. The niece of a Rabbi of Bohemia and cousin-in-law of Katz-descendant Teomin\u2014whose nephew later became the son-in-law of Rabbi David Oppenheim, Chief Rabbi of Moravia, Bohemia, and Prague\u2014Esther Schulhoff moved from Prague to Berlin and married Israel Aron after Prussia readmitted Jews. While Aron took on debt to compete against the Katz descendant Moses Wulff, a nephew of the Court Jew of Berlin Bernd Meisel Wulff, he died in 1673. \nBut as Sweden invaded Berlin in 1675, Esther wed Lipman Cohen-Behrens\u2019 cousin Johann Liebman in 1676, a year after his Goldschmidt wife died. As Johann became Court Jew to Prussian King Friedrich, Esther accompanied him to fairs, unlike most wives. Securing a moratorium on debts to Aaron\u2019s family and others, Esther freed herself of debt in 1684. As the rivalry with and debts from Wulff grew in 1686, the Liebmans convinced the King to expel Wulff from Prussia, and his property was confiscated. While Wulff became a Court Jew of Dessau, the Liebmans continued to block his return.\nAgainst Swedish copper wealth, Dutch VOC demand for copper recovered Japan\u2019s economy, making Japan the world\u2019s largest copper exporter from the late 1670s. Since 1661, Ming loyalists established a base in Taiwan, expelled the Dutch in 1662, and launched attack on mainland China. By 1683, China conquered Taiwan and opened ports. As villagers from Guangdong in Chaozhou traded sugar for rice, China allowed foreign trade, and established a customs house at Canton. As trade boomed, <italic>Sumitomo</italic> became Japan\u2019s main copper trader. Instead of leaving 60% to his son and splitting the rest, <italic>Sumitomo</italic> bestowed most of the estate to one son and provided funds for siblings to start a branch or gain employment to prevent splintering. \nWhile Emperor Leo briefly imprisoned Samuel Oppenheim in early 1683 for usury, Oppenheim\u2019s loans and assistance from Poland allowed Austria to defeat Turkey in the siege of Vienna that year. As Oppenheim continued financed Leo\u2019s war the Ottomans, he made Samson Wertheim manager of the Vienna house in 1685 to invest in real estate and other Court matters. Likewise, Oppenheim married his daughter Frumet to Joseph Guggenheim, who became his agent in Tirol and Switzerland, and then they moved to Vienna.\nBy the 1680s, increasing hostility from clergy and local populations toward New Christians and Jews, influenced King Louis XIV. In 1682, the Jews of the Free Port of Marseilles were expelled. While Finance Minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert encouraged Jews earlier, he proposed limitations before dying in 1683. Since Colbert centralized tax receivers and tariffs, his successor abolished tax farms and delegalized unrecorded chattel loans to tax transactions. So, notaries replaced banks in intermediating credit. Unlike banks, the notary cartel regulated entry with unlimited liability. As Huguenots dominated commerce, debtors blamed them for high interest rates, and Louis XIV revoked religious tolerance of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. \nFleeing France, Huguenots transferred wealth to Dutch or Swiss bankers, leading France allow some to remain in Paris to finance the <italic>Royal</italic> <italic>Treasury</italic>. Even as La Rochelle\u2019s Huguenot population fell, endogamous Huguenots continued dominating that economy. Also in 1685, Toulouse executed Jews and confiscated of their goods. At the insistence of the Jesuits, France expelled Jews from her Caribbean colonies. But with the loss of Huguenots and Jews, Bordeaux allowed Jews to continue their commercial activities from 1686. After invading Germany and burning the Imperial cities of Worms, Speyer, and Oppenheim by 1689, France abolished Worms\u2019 Jewish freedoms even as Oppenheim and Wertheim rebuilt the ghettos out of Vienna.\nThe disruption and contracts of the war created new dynamics. In Frankfurt, Meier Cahn\u2019s son Moses Schiff, an extended cousin of Oppenheim and a descendant of the Parnas of Frankfurt from before the<italic> Thirty Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, became one of the wealthiest Jews of his time. Likewise, Lemle Reinganum ascended through trade, dealing in horses, grain, honey, and hides with his father, he became a Protected Jew in Mannheim by 1688. By 1698, Reinganum floated bank notes to lease the Elector of Palatinate\u2019s salt shelf for a decade with Jacob Kann of Frankfurt and his brother-in-law Aaron Oppenheim, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s cousin.\nAmid Turkish threats on the Austrian border, meanwhile, the Kohanim Lazarus Hirschel fled Moravia to join his cousin at the Imperial Mint of Breslau in 1683. Additionally, became Court Jew for Countess Maria P\u00e4lffy and his son soon married a Gomperz. Capturing Turkish Sarajevo in 1679, Hungary in 1683, and Buda in 1688, Austria slaughtered most Turks and their Jewish supporters. By 1688, Hirschel kinterlinked with Behrend Lehmann. \nA son of the wealthy Levite Rabbi of Essen, Behrend Lehmann fled persecution for Halberstadt, despite high taxes, where he became an agent of Lipman Cohen-Behrens, and their children soon married. Since becoming Court Jew of Hannover, Cohen-Behrens received Harz mountains mining rights with his cousin Johann Liebman in return for co-funding with his in-law Behrend Lehmann the rise of Ernest Augustus\u2014son-in-law of Elector of Palatinate Frederick V and England\u2019s King James\u2014to Elector of Hannover in 1692.\nWhile Oppenheim\u2019s eldest son wed Elias Gomperz\u2019s granddaughter Judith and funded Austria\u2019s expansion into the Balkans and Hungarian lands out to Wallachia, Oppenheim and his son were arrested on suspicion of plotting Wertheim\u2019s murder in 1697. As they defaulted on their debts to Glikl\u2019s son, she pawned her belongings before verifying that Oppenheim paid, shortly before he was released. As Berlin creditors pursued her son, Glikl sought Lipman Cohen-Behrens\u2019 aid for safe-conduct in Hannover. Around this time, Oppenheim\u2019s children and grand-children\u2014and their Guggenheim and Schiff spouses\u2014left Vienna for Frankfurt. In Berlin, Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s great-niece wed Koppel Frankel\u2019s third-great nephew.\nDespite the default, Austria gained Turkish Wallachia in the 1699 <italic>Peace of Karlowitz</italic> and Emperor Leo I granted a princely title to Nicolas Mavrocordato, a descendant of the Byzantine Imperial Palaiologos family and brother-in-law of the Ghicas. But Oppenheim faced a new challenge. In 1700, the death of the childless Charles II ended Spain\u2019s inbred Habsburg branch triggered the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic>. Along with his son-in-law Imperial Court Jew Guggenheim, Samuel Oppenheim covered Austrian troops before dying in 1703. Although Samuel\u2019s son Emmanuel inherited his position, Emmanuel fell into bankruptcy as creditors ran from his notes. As Glikl\u2019s son lost access to Oppenheim\u2019s credit, he turned to Christian lender Rhost. \nWhile Emmanuel soon resumed operations and settled debts, the Emperor contested Oppenheim debts as usurious and promoted Wertheim and Breslau Mint Jew Lazarus Hirschel. While Hirschel\u2019s daughter married Isaac, the son of Nathan Oppenheim and Veronica Wertheim in 1703, his request for a Hungarian bank went nowhere. By 1704, Hirschel was Imperial Mint Jew of Breslau. Lazarus\u2019 greatest achievement was floating a large loan in 1709, he soon died. His sons, became Court factors in Saxony and Poland. \nSimilarly, Hungarian noble Paul Bagossy, leading a foot regiment in 1702, sought uniforms and approached Schlesinger, who sold the uniforms on credit. As Bagossy was killed in 1703, Schlesinger approached the unit\u2019s officer to collect the debt, who offered a horse and pistols as collateral. Schlesinger then sought intervention from the Emperor, who ordered Bagossy\u2019s heirs to repay Schlesinger\u2019s debt with damages.\nDespite Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s death, his allies and descendants continued intermarrying as they served a kaleidoscope of mercurial rulers. As Lemle Reinganum became Court Jew of Elector of Palatinate, his brother Mayer wed Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s great-granddaughter. Although Reinganum\u2019s salt lease partner Jacob Kann died in 1700, his brother-in-law Aaron Oppenheim continued financing the Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth and the electors of Mainz and the Palatinate. \nBy 1705, Moses Schiff\u2019s children kinterlinked with a grandson of Lipman Cohen-Behrens and Joseph Goldschmidt, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s third cousin twice removed, and Oppenheim-in-law Mozes Gomperz. Since Elias Gomperz died, his brother became chief tax collector of the Duchies of Cleves and Mark, and another brother\u2019s sons, Mozes and Benedickt, became Court Jews of Prussian King Frederick William I. While Benedickt Gomperz married Mayer Reinganum\u2019s daughter after his brother Lemle\u2019s salt lease expired in 1708, Aaron Oppenheim died in 1712, leading his deceased brother-in-law\u2019s son to declare bankruptcy. While many lost in Frankfurt\u2019s record bankruptcy, the Kanns remained Frankfurt\u2019s most powerful family. Mayer Reinganum\u2019s daughters wed the sons of Moses Schiff in 1713 and Emmanuel Oppenheim in 1719.\nBecoming a widower in 1707, Behrend Lehmann married Hanna Gomperz Oppenheim, Emmanuel Oppenheim\u2019s second cousin twice removed and a cousin of Emmanuel\u2019s wife, Judith Gomperz. By 1710, Lehmann acquired the estates of Lissa, Reisen, Zaborowo, and Luschwitz as collateral for debt owed by Radziwill cousin Stanislaw Leszczy\u0144ski, the deposed King of Poland. (Since Jews could not own land, Lehmann placed the lands in the care of Saxon King Augustus II for whom he became Court Jew.)\nAfter Emperor Leo died in 1705, he was followed by Joseph, who took some initial steps towards a rational financial by establishing Austria\u2019s note-issuing monopoly, <italic>Bank of Vienna</italic>. Charles VI took power following his brother Joseph\u2019s death in 1711. Wertheim served all three as Imperial Court Jew with marriages in lockstep. In 1705, Samson Wertheim\u2019s daughter Tolze wed Joseph Oppenheim, a son of Chef Rabbi of Moravia and Imperial Court Jew in Hanover Lipman Cohen-Behrens\u2019 daughter. As Samson\u2019s eldest son, Wolf, wed his second cousin, a daughter of Emanuel Oppenheim and Judith Gomperz in 1709, Wolf\u2019s sister wed Darmstadt\u2019s Chief Rabbi. \nIn 1711, Charles VI appointed Wertheim the first Chief Rabbi of Hungary. Following Hungary\u2019s decision to fund an army in 1715, Emanuel Oppenheim and Wolf Schlesinger contracted to supply flour. Notably, Schlesinger held a privilege in Pest and was accompanied by his cousin Samuel in his ventures. Following another Austro-Turkish war, they expanded in Pest as Austria captured Buda in 1717. In 1719, former Emperor Joseph Habsburg\u2019s daughter married the son of Elector Augustus II, tying Austria and Saxony. \nSome Frankels wed Hirschel and Synger Mint Jews. After his grandson was appointed Chief Rabbi of Ansbach in 1693, former-Court Jew Koppel Frankel\u2019s family and other refugees from Vienna, settled near Nuremberg in the Jewish community of F\u00fcrth by 1702. Frankel\u2019s daughter Esther married a Prague banker, and their son became a Parnas of Prague. While one of Esther\u2019s brothers became a rabbi in Holleschau, Moravia, Pinsk, and Wuerzburg, another led F\u00fcrth. The son of the latter became Chief Rabbi for Schnaittach and Ansbach in 1710, and later of Brandenburg. The third brother\u2019s sons were Hirsch and Elkan. \nHirsch became Chief Rabbi of Kurpfalz around 1702 and Chief Rabbi of Schwabach in 1709. Around this time, Elkan became the Court Jew of the Markgraf of Brandenburg-Onoholzbach. By 1710, the Markgraf promoted Elkan to Ober-Parness. Although Koppel warned his descendants to avoid Kabbala, Hirsch became involved in the mystical worship, soon causing trouble for him and his brother Elkan. In 1710, two Jewish converts with criminal records, denounced Court Jew Elkan Frankel, including accusations of insulting a baptized Jew and possessing Jewish books with anti-Christian content, reached the Markgraf. \nWithout proof or due process, Elkan received a harsh sentence of corporal punishment and life imprisonment. His fortune was seized, and his wife and daughter were forced to leave the country. He endured suffering in a dungeon until his death in 1720. Likewise, Elkan\u2019s brother, Rabbi Hirsch Frankel, was accused of sorcery due to his Kabbalistic practices in 1713. Imprisoned for life, he was released twenty-four years during a flood. Hirsch lived for another three years, before dying at the age of 78 in 1740. \nFollowing the <italic>Treaty of Ryswick</italic> in 1697, Duke of Lorraine and Habsburg cousin Leo married a niece of France\u2019s Louis XIV and raised funds by attracting rich Jews from Metz to Nancy. After eleven years of refusing suitors, Glikl wed Hirsch Levy-Wimpfen, son of a Metz banker descended from Frankfurt Landas, in 1700. However, impatient creditors pushed Hirsch into bankruptcy by 1702. Glikl struggled while Hirsch settled with his creditors, but her family thrived. \nGlikl\u2019s stepson, Samuel Levy-Wimpfen, became the Chief Rabbi of Upper Alsace. He soon became Duke Leo\u2019s Court Jew, moving to Lorraine in 1709, and supplying funds, goods, and grain. Additionally, Levy took charge of <italic>Lorraine Mint</italic>, sparking a currency war with France. As Louis XIV\u2019s ordered Levy to disassociate from the mint, Samuel\u2019s father died, leaving Glikl dependent on her children. After becoming Lorraine\u2019s treasurer in 1715, Samuel was accused of not paying the troops, leading to his bankruptcy and imprisonment.\n<italic>Philosophy & Panics</italic>\nDuring the turbulent aftermath of the <italic>Panic of 1648</italic>, Russia witnessed significant religious upheaval as Orthodox reforms aimed at aligning practices with the Greek Orthodox tradition led to the emergence of the Old Believers, triggering a schism among parishioners. Despite their endogamous practices, the Old Believers found a surprising degree of social acceptance, with up to a third of the serf population rapidly adopting their beliefs. Notably, this religious discord intersected with political intrigue, as exemplified by the rise of Sophia, the sixth daughter of Tsar Aleksei, to power in 17th century Russia.\nBorn in 1657, Sophia initially seemed unlikely to ascend to a position of authority. However, a series of events unfolded that propelled her to become regent over her brothers, Peter and infant Ivan. For seven years, she navigated foreign relations and fostered a degree of reconciliation with the Old Believers. Nevertheless, her reign was cut short in 1689 when Peter, Ivan, and their supporters challenged her authority, later confining her to a convent. \nDespite this, women ruled Russia for about a century starting with Sophia reign from 1682 through the end of Catherine II\u2019s reign in 1800. Over this time, Russia\u2019s borders transformed. At the start of the 17th century, Russia found herself at the edges of European power struggles, with its borders not yet extending to the Baltic or Black Seas, and vulnerable to neighboring Swedish, Polish, and Turkish empires. \nLikewise, Spain and Portugal lost their near monopoly of global colonization and trade. In the 17th century, English King James became the first European power to challenge Spain, with <italic>Virginia Co</italic>. Since his daughter married Elector of Palatinate Frederick V, James supported Frederick\u2019s in-laws\u2014the German landowning (\u201cJunkers\u201d) Dukes of Polish Courland on the Baltic\u2014in colonize Tobago and Gambia. However, English support for Courland\u2019s colonization efforts waned after the geopolitical calculus changed following the British Civil War and competition with the Dutch and the chartered <italic>English</italic><italic> Africa Co </italic>(\u201cEAC\u201d), leading Courland to withdraw from the colonies by 1692. \nThe EAC monopoly sought to replace the gold- and slave-trading free agent pirates, like the ones that first sold Black slaves to<italic> Virginia Co</italic> in 1619. Since the Commonwealth period, England\u2019s power and overseas trade expanded rapidly, coinciding with the rise of the Sephardic community in London. \nThe parliamentary expedition of 1651 reduced Dutch influence and displaced English royalists from Barbados, allowing England and the Sephardim to establish a transatlantic network. Although England and France surpassed the Dutch as naval powers and possessed larger sugar-plantation colonies, Dutch dominance in trade with Spanish America persisted due to Spanish Habsburg\u2019s preference for <italic>Dutch West Indies Co</italic> (\u201cGWC\u201d) to supply Black slaves through Cura\u00e7ao since expulsion from Brazil. \nAs the Dutch and Spanish allied against the French and English during the <italic>Franco-Dutch War</italic> of the 1670s, Cura\u00e7ao became a pivotal port for the <italic>asiento</italic>, a slave trade monopoly for Spanish America. Descended from Portuguese New Christian refugees in Amsterdam (of unknown relation to the Seneor-Coronel family), Jacob Senior and his brother Jacob served under John Maurice, Governor of Dutch Brazil until loss to Portugal in 1654. While Brazil expelled Jews, Senior\u2019s Lopes Henriques cousins were recognized as Dutch nationals. \nAs Senior soon served as the Cura\u00e7ao factor for <italic>Portuguese</italic> <italic>Africa Co</italic> and commander of a fleet of galliots over Spanish trade routes, Mosseh Senior\u2019s family associated with the Hague circle of Stadholder William of Orange and his wife Mary Stuart. As Resident of the King of Spain in the Netherlands, Manuel Belmonte secured Dutch aid for Spain against France and became a silent partner Cura\u00e7ao <italic>asiento</italic> and formed <italic>Guinea Co</italic> in the 1680s.\nManaged from 1661, GWC subcontracted the <italic>asiento</italic> to Denmark, Sweden, Brandenburg, and England by the 1670s. Cura\u00e7ao served as a hub for exchange between Europe and the Americas. New Christian agents in Portugal benefited from ties with Sephardic relatives in Northern Europe, allowing Jacob Senior Henriques to become Cura\u00e7ao\u2019s factor for <italic>Portuguese</italic> <italic>Africa Co</italic> and command ships along Spanish trade routes. Likewise, the Jews of Rotterdam became tobacco commission agents and traders.\nSince Virginia began taxing Black labor over indentures and land as a progressive tax following the <italic>Panic of 1640</italic>, the colony adopted the Roman dictum \u2018Partus sequitur ventrem\u2019 in 1662, that a child\u2019s status followed that of the mother. Over this time, the Christian Perry family of Devon<italic> </italic>established <italic>Perry Lane</italic>, leading English trade with the Chesapeake and London\u2019s foremost tobacco importer. With headquarters in Williamsburg, Virginia, <italic>Perry Lane</italic>\u2019s influence extended to the <italic>Exchequer</italic> and the Board of Trade in London, maintaining a central role in Virginia\u2019s economy until the mid-18th century. \nIn 1635, London merchant John Evance emigrated to Virginia and traded with Barbados before fathering Stephen in 1654 in New Haven, Connecticut. Apprenticing in London with the Medieval chartered guild <italic>Goldsmith Co</italic> from 1669, Stephen rose to become Cashier of <italic>Hudson</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Bay Co</italic> by 1681, establishing the sale of American furs to Russia. Stephen Evance diversified his investments, including stocks in the EAC and EIC, and engaged in various ventures such as leasing trading ships and financing steel manufacturing. He also pursued interests in salvage operations, mining, privateering, and fisheries off Ireland. \nA member of <italic>Goldsmith Co</italic> since 1665, Francis Child married the daughter of another goldsmith, and became a large EIC stockholder as <italic>Child</italic> kept EIC\u2019s account. But as leading goldsmith banker <italic>Backwell</italic> failed to finance EIC, the latter turned to Anglo-Dutch Sephardi, including in-laws Pereira and Medina, who already unofficially intermediated American precious metals for Dutch trade with Asia. Their likely cousins, Mocatta moved to London, forming <italic>Mocatta</italic> in 1684 to broker gold and silver.\nWhile Arabs ruled East African for centuries, Indians dominated trade and finance. Although Portugal battled with Oman from the 15th century, the Omani cemented their grasp of Zanzibar and other East African territories. By 1698, under the leadership, the Omani ousted the Portuguese from Mombasa, intermarried with Swahili notables, and established nearly unbroken dynastic sovereignty into the 19th century. Centering on these territories, Indians led the Arabian slave and spice trade. \nLikewise, the Barbary pirates of North Africa continued to enslave hundreds of thousands of White Europeans, particularly in Algiers, Morocco, Tripoli, and Tunis, between 1550 and 1730. This practice posed significant challenges to international trade, as regularly sold captured sailors who were unable to raise the necessary ransoms. Instead of free trade, however, England continued to embrace monopolies.\nWhile Black slave labor fueled Caribbean investment, Dutch free religion funneled capital from Habsburg Spain and Germany to England. Originating from Lisbon, the DaCosta cousins Moses Gideon Abudiente left Lisbon in the 16th century for Amsterdam. Settling in Hamburg, he became a renowned poet, dying in 1688. His son anglicized as Rowland Gideon, migrated to Barbados. In the 17th century, the island\u2019s Jewry thrived trading sugar, gaining recognition in 1655 and establishing a synagogue by 1679. After his Rowland\u2019s death, his son Samson Gideon continued as a West Indies merchant. \nAnd in Germany, after Lipman Cohen-Behrens became Hannover\u2019s Court Jew, he received mining rights in the Harz mountains with his cousin Johann Liebman in return for co-funding, with his in-law Behrend Lehmann, the rise of Ernest Augustus\u2014son-in-law of Elector of Palatinate Frederick V and England\u2019s King James\u2014to Elector of Hannover in 1692. Branching from Hanover to Dutch free religion, Cohen-Behrens soon supported the Dutch House of Orange.\nWith such privilege came dangers. While France revoked religious tolerance against Huguenots in 1685. Fleeing France, Huguenots transferred wealth to Dutch or Swiss bankers, leading France allow some to remain in Paris to finance the <italic>Royal</italic> <italic>Treasury</italic>. Even as La Rochelle\u2019s Huguenot population fell, endogamous Huguenots continued dominating that economy. After invading Germany and burning the Imperial cities of Worms, Speyer, and Oppenheim by 1689, France abolished Worms\u2019 Jewish freedoms even as Oppenheim and Wertheim rebuilt the ghettos out of Vienna.\nMeanwhile, the French mercantile policies designed by Colbert in 1678 fostered tensions with England, which restricted French trade and fostered relations with Portugal. By this time, interlinked Huguenot financial and trade networks connected French, Portuguese, Dutch, and English commerce. Among the most prominent members of these networks were the London-born Houblons, whose forebears had fled Belgium in 1567 to escape Catholic Spanish persecution. \nJames Houblon was an elder of the French Church in London, while his sons, cousins, and in-laws became influential in EIC as well as Portuguese, Spanish, and Levantine trade. For their trade, the Houblons depended on <italic>Backwell</italic> until the <italic>Panic of 1672</italic>. After Huguenots fled France following the revocation of religious tolerance in 1685, the Houblons\u2019 power grew servicing co-religionists in London.\nSince Cornwall-born Sidney Godolphin mediated on behalf of English King Charles II in 1668, he wavered on excluding Charles\u2019 Catholic brother James from the throne. Initially aligned with Robert Spencer, Earl of Sunderland, a fellow descendant of Charlemagne, they advocated for limitations on James\u2019 powers and urged William of Orange to support James\u2019 Protestant daughter Mary Stuart\u2019s claim. While King Charles dismissed Spencer in 1681, Godolphin retained his position in the Court and <italic>Exchequer</italic>. \nWith Huguenot and Sephardic (including Suasso Pinto) funds, the Dutch funded Queen Mary II and her husband William of Orang, to replace her father in the <italic>Glorious Revolution</italic> from 1688. While Godolphin facilitated James II\u2019s flight to France, King William appointed him Lord of <italic>Exchequer</italic> in 1690 to manage funds for the war against Louis XIV. \nAs liberal religious policies legitimized Quakers, their activism waned and they reformed doctrine to assimilate. But Jews and Irish Catholics lacked civic and political equality for decades. As King, William actively borrowed from goldsmith-bankers like Stephen Evance, Francis Child, and Charles Duncombe, connected to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Court Banker Thomas Gresham. \nWhile Child became the Royal Jeweler for the duration of the war, Evance received an officership in the Excise. To manage <italic>Exchequer</italic> debts, Evance imported gold and exported silver with Dutch Sephardi Jews, including Alfonso Rodriguez and Isaac Pereira. Recognized for his contributions, Evance was knighted in 1690. King William continued to employ Court Jews directly, relying on as Medina and Pereira for supplies in armies in Ireland and Antwerp. \nAlthough carrying less Charles II type asset seizure risk, merchants worried that French victory would lead to the replacement of the Protestant William with the Catholic James II. Like the Dutch, England\u2019s <italic>Exchequer</italic> launched a lottery in 1693 with interest-paying blanks circulating for years. Within months\u2014eighty years after <italic>Bank of Amsterdam</italic>\u2014<italic>Parliament</italic> chartered <italic>Bank of England</italic> (\u201cBOE\u201d). To promote trade over note inflation, only merchant banks brokering foreign trade bills payable in London (\u201cMMBU\u201d) led BOE.\nAs English merchants had focused on Portuguese commodities amidst the <italic>Glorious Revolution</italic> and war against France, the Huguenot cousinhood dominated BOE. John Houblon was elected BOE\u2019s first Governor and his brothers James and Abraham served as directors alongside cousins and in-laws Samuel Lethieullier, James Lordell, and Theodore Janssen. Houblon\u2019s daughter soon married an in-law of a descendant of King Henry IV as well as goldsmith Thomas Vyner\u2019s great-nephew.\nThe same year, Harry Hope, an extended cousin of the Houblons, established <italic>Hope</italic> banking house in Amsterdam. Other early BOE investors were Anglo-Dutch Sephardi, included Pereira, Medina, Mendes DaCosta, and Teixeira. While Evance and most goldsmiths opposed BOE for crowding them out of the <italic>Exchequer</italic> business, <italic>Freame</italic> and others opened accounts with BOE.\nWith the death of Queen Mary, William became the sole monarch. By then unchartered joint-stock trusts\u2014<italic>bubbles</italic>\u2014grew fivefold since the <italic>Glorious Revolution</italic>. These <italic>bubbles</italic> included financials., the largest of which were the Mendes\u2019 <italic>Million Bank</italic>, which converted <italic>Exchequer</italic> blank lottery tickets into perpetual bonds, and an <italic>Orphans Bank</italic>.<italic> </italic>While BOE refused to service these unchartered <italic>bubbles</italic>, the Scot Parliament chartered <italic>Bank of Scotland </italic>and <italic>Scottish</italic> <italic>Trading</italic><italic> Co</italic>, to compete with the English BOE, EIC, EAC, and <italic>Hudson</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Bay</italic>. \nAs the debased <italic>pound</italic>\u2019s FX deteriorated sharply, BOE suspended cash payouts facing attacks on its reserves by goldsmiths. Riots erupted with <italic>Exchequer</italic> bills falling to a 40% discount and over 70% of <italic>bubbles</italic> failing. Attempts to stabilize the situation, including an interest rate on <italic>Exchequer</italic> bills, reformation of the debased currency, and a proposal for a national land bank failed to restore confidence. As BOE sought a provider  of gold and silver, she soon turned to pepper merchant <italic>Mocatta</italic>. \nAfter years of struggling with credit, Lord of <italic>Exchequer</italic> Godolphin resigned due to <italic>Panic of 1696</italic>. After Robert Spencer\u2019s son became Earl of Sunderland, he married the Duke of Marlborough John Churchill\u2019s daughter in 1695, and her sister married Godolphin\u2019s son in 1698. Anticipating another war with France, King William returned Godolphin as Lord of <italic>Exchequer</italic> in 1700.\nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1695</italic>, Parliament restricted brokers and delegalized lotteries. After Parliament warned him against impairing the <italic>Exchequer</italic>\u2019s financial difficulties in 1696, Evance succeeded Francis Child as Royal Jeweler the following year. By 1700, he resumed the governorship of <italic>Hudson</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Bay</italic>. While Child served as an EIC Director as <italic>Child</italic> kept EIC\u2019s account, Francis\u2019 brother married a son of goldsmith William Backwell, who had been ruined by King Charles II in the <italic>Panic of 1672</italic>, and expanding his client base.\nAlso in 1696, EIC convinced Parliament to block English capital to <italic>Scottish</italic> <italic>Trading</italic>, which failed and destabilized Scottish credit. As poor laws enslaved coalers in 1701, continuing unrest forced <italic>Bank of Scotland</italic> to suspend payment on in late 1704, and squeezed BOE, which avoided crisis by issuing interest-bearing bills. As the <italic>Act of Union of 1707</italic> fused Scotland and England into Britain, Scottish merchants came under the <italic>Navigation Acts</italic> opening American tobacco and other English overseas possessions to the Scots. With the legalization of Quakers since 1689 and continuing kinterlinking between the Huguenots with the Dutch, the Jews remained the last discriminated minority middlemen. But Jews and Irish Catholics lacked civic and political equality for decades.\nMeanwhile, dynastic changes destabilized Europe. As King John Sobieski of Poland died that year, Frederick Augustus II of Saxony secured loans from Lipman Cohen-Behrens and Behrend Lehmann, Court Jew of Brandenburg and Saxony. While Lehmann\u2019s daughter married a Hirschel, the son of Johann and Esther Liebman wed Merle Schiff. (Likewise, their Cohen-Behrens and Schiff cousins in Frankfurt also participated in the kinterlink.) When Prussia\u2019s Court Jew Johann Liebman died in 1701, his widow Esther continued his trade, becoming one of the wealthiest women in the world. \nFollowing the death of his brother and co-Tsar Ivan V of Russia in 1696, Peter became the sole Tsar. By 1699, Peter captured Azov, breaking the Ottoman-kinterlinked Giray Khanate\u2014which had allied with Poland against Russia\u2014in half. The same year, Charles XI of Sweden died, giving rise to his son. Power dynamics shifted with the new leaders, Russia joined Saxony-Poland and Denmark-Norway in a coalition against Sweden, leading to the <italic>Northern War</italic> from 1700.\nLikewise, since French fleets competed with England in the Americas at the end of the 17th century. While the import of slaves into Virginia accelerated after the <italic>Treaty of Ryswick</italic> in 1697, the death of the childless Charles II end of Spain\u2019s inbred Habsburgs triggered the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic> in 1700 over European access to Spanish colonies. Among the first acts of the new King Philip V was to transfer the slave trade <italic>asiento</italic>, then held by GWC, to the French<italic> </italic>King in 1701, who soon leased it. \nEarlier in 1698, Huguenot Samuel Bernard, Receiver-General at Bordeaux Antoine Crozat, military contractor and former tax-farmer Vincent Chambon, and Treasurer-General of the Galley Corps Pierre Thom\u00e9 formed a company to lease the tobacco monopoly. As Bernard became Court banker in 1701, <italic>Guinea </italic><italic>Co</italic> was reorganized by Bernard, Crozat, Mayon, Thom\u00e9, Crozat\u2019s brother-in-law tax-farmer Legendre d\u2019Arminy, Marine funds manager Jacques Vanolles, and Artillery finance overseer Etienne Landais. Soon after, these seven, along with Louis XIV, Philip V, and several others, established <italic>Asiento Co</italic>. The same group also founded <italic>Senegal Co</italic><italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic><italic>Saint-Domingue Co</italic>.\nSince Emperor Leo Habsburg secured his loans from Jean Coymans Deutz of Amsterdam by appointing him <italic>Imperial Factor of Mercury</italic> in 1659 and Deutz\u2019s cousin, Dutch banker Baltasar Coymans, took control of the <italic>asiento</italic> in 1667 with support from GWC and Cura\u00e7ao. Although Coymans obtained another <italic>asiento</italic> in 1685, he died the follow year, and the Inquisition annulled his contract in 1689.\nBy then, Jeans\u2019s widow inherited the business and financed Emperor Leo, including a large loan in 1695 for war finance. While their son married a daughter of a Coymans cousin and James Boreel\u2014who had served as an ambassador to Russia in 1664 and engaged in the <italic>Treaty of Ryswick</italic>\u2014James\u2019 son married the daughter of Andries Pels. By 1707, Pels founded Amsterdam bank <italic>Pels</italic>, which soon became a large merchant bank and discounter of acceptances.\nWhile the Houblons and their Huguenot cousins and in-laws continued to dominate BOE, John Houblon\u2019s niece married Sidney Godolphin\u2019s second cousin-in-law\u2014a son of Speaker of the Irish House of Commons and an English general\u2019s grandson\u2014in 1703. The same year, England\u2019s treaty with Portugal allowed English merchants preferential access to Portuguese markets. \nAs Solomon Medina supported the Duke of Marlborough\u2019s campaigns and became England\u2019s first knighted Jew, other Jews also funded the government. The son of a Rabbi of Breslau and, Aaron Hart left Breslau amidst talk of expulsion, and married the Rabbi of F\u00fcrth\u2019s daughter. Likewise, Aaron\u2019s brother Moses moved to London to set up a business with their Hamburg uncle, funded Godolphin\u2019s <italic>Exchequer</italic>, and became one of London\u2019s twelve Jewish brokers. From 1705, Aaron headed England\u2019s main Synagogue. \nMeanwhile, France inaugurated a lottery, but defaulted and debased her currency in a year. For financing the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic>, France mostly relied on <italic>asiento</italic> stakeholder Samuel Bernard, <italic>Lullin</italic>, and other Swiss Huguenots. A prominent exception was his Genoa contact, <italic>Sacerdote</italic>. Among the few Jews in northern Italy, the Kohanim Sacerdote family had served as military contractors through for Genoa, remitting funds and supplying grain for Bourbon troops stationed in Italy. Bernard\u2019s London agent was the Huguenot banker John Lamb, a naturalized Englishman since fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. \nAlong with FX contracting, Lamb banked King William\u2019s successor, Queen Anne, along with Solomon Medina and other Sephardi Court Jews as well as Royal Court Jeweler Stephan Evance. Using <italic>Sword Blade</italic>, which Parliament had charter for his earlier venture with funding from <italic>Child</italic> to manufacture swords, Evance joined with Child\u2019s friend John Blunt\u2014a <italic>scrivener</italic> who drew legal money contracts in competition with goldsmiths for banking services\u2014and advised Parliament to subdue Ireland and reducing public debt. As Parliament forced partible inheritance, <italic>Sword Blade</italic> swapped public debt for foreclosed Irish estates. One of these dispossessed Irish gentry families were the Cantillons of Kerry. While some moved to London to become bankers, Richard Cantillon moved to Spain for employment. \nAmidst fears of French invasion in 1708, <italic>Sword Blade</italic> aided runs from BOE. So, Parliament granted BOE an English banknote monopoly. While only BOE over demand-deposit banking with over six partners but permitted small banks and longer duration debt. But creditors ran from <italic>Exchequer bills</italic>, bankrupting banks. Amidst the crisis, Quaker goldsmith <italic>Freame</italic> of London married the son of East New Jersey proprietor descended from Scot Quaker Robert Barclay and Catherine Gordon. While the American branch of the Barclay family kinterlinked with the Dutch in New York, <italic>Freame</italic> closed her account with BOE.\nSo, the money famines that followed the <italic>Panic of 1708</italic> stimulated a boom in insurers\u2014primarily marriage, birth, and christening\u2014that were structured to limit shareholder liability from involuntary bankruptcy. By 1711, a new Chancellor developed equitable doctrine to hold trustees liable for profits. While Parliament allowed the law of 1697 banning stock brokerage to expire, they limited the spread that securities brokers could charge, delegalized private lotteries and insurers to monopolize lotteries, and repealed old bankruptcy descriptions and banker punishment. \nWhile Tories gained power, they could not control BOE, EIC, or African slave, agricultural, and gold trader, EAC. After a profitable period, EAC grew insolvent as Portuguese cartels and Anglo-Dutch free trade dominated gold and slave trade. As British merchants disallowed American colonies\u2019 debt stays and anti-slavery taxes, Virginia protected plantations with unrecorded mortgage transfers. But she exempted slaves and tightened primogeniture. \nSince the early 17th century, the iron industry in England began experimenting with coal as an alternative to wood for smelting iron, marking the initial stages of a significant shift. The rising cost of timber and fuel scarcity influenced industries prompted Quaker iron works shift from oak-rich Wales northward to coal fields closer to Scotland. Despite the <italic>Navigation Acts</italic>, American wood and lard imports played a significant role in keeping British fuel prices low, comprising over half of the total tons entering English ports from abroad around 1700. As unregulated collieries in northern England expanded supplies, attempts at organization cartels led Parliament to enact an anti-combination law in 1711. Soon after Abraham Darby innovated coal-based coke for iron smelting in 1713, less than a quarter of the country\u2019s iron output relied on charcoal. Still, England continued to depend on American timber imports for ships and other uses.\nAs Russia and her allies battled Sweden and Poland in the <italic>Northern War</italic>, tax revenues fell in Moscow and other municipalities, Tsar Peter centralized administration of Moscow and provincial cities with self-government to the townsmen. Founding Saint-Petersburg as Russia\u2019s capital, he welcomed German settlers, but restricted Jews by 1703, and wed a Polish peasant, Catherine. Halting a pogrom later, Peter allowed Jews into his city in 1708. While Radziwill cousin King of Poland Stanislaw Leszczy\u0144ski had pledged his estates of Lissa, Reisen, Zaborowo, and Luschwitz for a loan from Behrend Lehmann, his losses in 1709, forced him to relinquish his crown and collateral. Since Jews could not own land, Lehmann placed the lands in the care of Saxon King Augustus II and became his Court Jew. \nSoon, Esther Liebman of Prussia, Behrend Lehmann\u2019s in-law, supported her son, Isaac, to arm Denmark-Norway in 1710 with his father\u2019s cousin Lipman Cohen-Behrens of Hanover in joining Russia against Sweden. As Peter orchestrated the marriage between his niece Anna and Frederick William, Duke of Courland, in 1710, he sought to negotiate with England over Tobago. By early 1711, Frederick died, and Anna assumed control of Courland and retained Isaac\u2019s cousin Isay Liebman as Court Jew. However, Isaac Liebman died several months later  and King Friedrick I of Prussia passed away by 1713. Without her patron and protector, Esther was arrested on fraud charges. After settling her debts, she died within a year. \nAmong the most powerful Christian merchant bankers to arise at this time also served German kings. As outsider could not engage in Berlin\u2019s guild-monopolized trades, Christians David Splitgerber of newly annexed Pomerania and Gottfried Daum of Saxony became commission agents in 1712. Trading wines, tapestries, and colonial goods, Daum married a prosperous tailor\u2019s daughter in 1713. Along with securing contracts with Saxon King Augustus II to supply armaments, <italic>Splitgerber Daum</italic> took over the Neustadt-Eberswalde copperworks and gained a monopoly in the Brandenburg region from 1719. Along with developing an agency in Saint-Petersburg to sell cloth, <italic>Splitgerber Daum</italic> made payments to recruit soldiers from London.\nWith the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession </italic>ending and debts growing, Evance unwound <italic>Sword Blade</italic>\u2019s Irish operations, and convinced Parliament to charter <italic>South Sea Co</italic> (\u201cSSC\u201d) as a competitor EAC in 1711<italic>.</italic> SSC soon won a contract to handle<italic> Exchequer</italic>\u2019s lottery alongside BOE.<italic> </italic>While Evance remained Head of <italic>Hudson Bay</italic> and promoted SSC, he was overwhelmed by financial distress and committed suicide in 1712.  \nAmong several Dutch directors was Amsterdam-born Matthew Decker, a descendant of Flemish Protestants, who moved to London in 1702 and acted as London correspondent for <italic>Pels</italic>. A year after marrying a daughter of an Anglican Rector in 1710, he was appointed an SSC director, but resigned in 1712 to direct EIC. Amsterdam-born Huguenot Theodore Janssen, a co-founder of BOE, was involved. So was BOE co-founder James Bateman, a Flemish descendant who was involved in the Portuguese trade with the Houblons.\nHaving advised on the lottery, <italic>Sword Blade</italic> Secretary John Blunt married the daughter of a former EAC director, and became the leading SSC promoter. At the end of the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic>, financially strained France ceded Spanish <italic>asiento</italic><italic> </italic>to Britain, and Britain signed a slave trade monopoly with Span in 1713, ending Spain\u2019s arrangement with GWC and the Sephardim of Cura\u00e7ao, and allowing SSC to open a trading post in Argentina. Before reopening her account with BOE in 1716, goldsmith<italic> Freame</italic> invested in SSC in 1714.\nSince funding Queen Anne, naturalized Huguenot merchant John Lamb became an SSC Director. Lamb was also the London agent for French exporter Antoine Crozat. SSC shareholders also included Crozat\u2019s fellow French investors from the 1701 <italic>Asiento Co</italic> and related enterprises. As the war and blockade with Barcelona crippled Marseille, France relied on Crozat for trade and to managing the Church\u2019s revenues. After Crozat banked the French royal family, oversaw taxes for southwest France, and financed the armies in Spain, he received a charter for <italic>Louisiana</italic> in 1712. \nWhile the French chartered monopoly <italic>Louisiana</italic> battled the newly illegal free trade between French settlers and the Natchez natives, the trade continued. After Crozat built a storehouse at Natchez to buy deerskins in 1714, a Natchez party assassinated traders in 1715. As <italic>Louisiana </italic>led a small army to negotiate, the Natchez agreed to build a new fortified post for the French garrison and trade, resulting in the establishment of Fort Rosalie in 1716 to monopolize trade and keep out Britain. \nLike SSC, BOE slave ties grew. Humphry Morice, born in 1679 in Lincolnshire to a London merchant. He started his independent trade by 1702, expanding into the Baltic, Mediterranean, and transatlantic slave trades. His first venture in 1704 failed when their ship was captured by French privateers. Undeterred, Morice invested in at least 109 voyages, transporting over 30,000 enslaved Africans to the Americas. His business innovations included strategic ship relays and pre-planned rendezvous points to maximize trade efficiency. Opposing EAC\u2019s monopoly, he lobbied Parliament by 1709. After his political career began in 1710 with a parliamentary seat in Newport, Cornwall, he became a BOE director from 1716.\nBy then, the childless British Queen Anne died. As the Protestant descendant of Sophia of Hanover, a granddaughter of James I, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg George Louis became King George I in 1714. Since a duke in Hanover, George used the services of Sephardi Aaron Franks. After Aaron\u2019s son Naphtali moved to London in 1697, and became the \u2018<italic>Jew Broker of London</italic>,\u2019 Aaron lent jewels for the Duke\u2019s coronation. While two of Naphtali\u2019s sons banked in London, a third, Jacob, moved to America, where he became the King\u2019s exclusive agent for the Northern Colonies in Philadelphia. When Naphtali\u2019s son wed Moses Hart\u2019s daughter in 1720, Moses Hart built the <italic>Great Synagogue</italic> by 1722, which his brother Rabbi Aaron Hart led.\nIn France, however, the death of the indebted Louis XIV in 1715 spurred bankruptcies and the country to the brink of economic collapse. The country soon turned to Scot John Law. While Law\u2019s father was Baron William Law and Laird of Lauriston, his mother was a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and of the House of Argyll. His extended cousin, Receiver General of Excise John Campbell\u20142nd Duke of Argyll and husband of Mary Duncombe\u2014may have promoted Law\u2019s ideas around when he negotiated the <italic>Union of 1705</italic> before commanding under the Duke of Marlborough. \nThe Campbells were also related to <italic>Drummond </italic>by blood and marriage through the Murrays. Since Andrew Drummond, a descendant of Charlemagne and the 1st Earl of Argyll, founded <italic>Drummond</italic> in London by 1712 and competed with <italic>Child</italic> and <italic>Hoare</italic>, his brother William Drummond participated in rebellion against the English in 1715. Another clansman, George Campbell partnered with goldsmith George Middleton in 1692. \nWhile John Law\u2019s brother William acted as his representative in financial dealings in London, the Law brothers engaged <italic>Middleton Campbell</italic> to facilitate international gold for stock trades settled with <italic>Mocatta</italic> involving EIC and SSC shares. From 1708, John Law lived in Genoa, held accounts with <italic>Banco di San Giorgio</italic>, which inspired his business dealing. Law continued to work with the Genoese after leaving for Milan and then Paris. Kinterlinking with Levy-Ximenes in 1712, <italic>Mocatta</italic> acted as bullion broker for BOE, EIC, and <italic>Royal Mint</italic>. Like his father, Francis Child\u2019s son Robert served as EIC Director around 1710, became Deputy Chair in 1714, and Chair in 1715. For Deputy Cashier, SSC retained Robert Surman, a clerk of goldsmith banker <italic>Martin</italic>, connected to Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Court Banker Thomas Gresham and the Duncombes.  \nUnder Law, France chartered <italic>Indes </italic>like a fusion of most British chartered companies combined in 1717, replacing <italic>Senegal Co</italic> and <italic>Guinea Co</italic>. As the sole tax collector, minter, and colonial trader, <italic>Indes </italic>swapped her equity for state debts. As France ceded <italic>Louisiana</italic> to <italic>Indes</italic>, commercial activity and investment in the Mississippi Valley grew. Fort Saint-Pierre was established in 1719 up the Yazoo River to expand trade with neighboring native tribes, and a French garrison was stationed among the Caddo to promote trade alliances. To grow <italic>Louisiana</italic> from 1717, France banished vagabonds to Louisiana and<italic> Indes </italic>sent a flood of settlers and slaves. Following French lead, Britain deported convicts in 14-year terms. As Parliament outlawed in-kind salaries, she began applying capital punishment to labor unions by trade. \nSince 1711, Turkish Janissaries fled to Tripoli and elsewhere in North Africa, inter-marrying with the locals and establishing dynasties of their own. Although Tripoli was a base of the Barbary pirates, the Janissaries soon concluded trade agreements with Britain and France. Also in 1711, Austrian Emperor Leo\u2019s second son and successor, Charles VI, opened a free port in Trieste to promote trade in his dominions. After the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic>, the <italic>Treaty of Utrecht</italic> in 1713 transferred control of Belgium, Naples, Milan, and Sardinia from the extinct Spanish branch to the Austrian Habsburgs. That year, Austria founded <italic>Vienna Municipal Bank</italic> to manage the central government\u2019s debts and received revenue sources such as agricultural estates and monopolies in salt, mercury, and copper.\nBefore 1713, the treaty that ended <italic>Eighty Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic> in 1648 limited Belgian trade to Spain and her colonies, leading Belgian firms to establish in Seville and Cadiz, which became hubs for the American fleet and smuggling. After 1713, liberal Viennese views on trade prompted Belgian and Irish entrepreneurs to launch private expeditions from the Port of Ostend beginning in 1715. While these investors formed partnerships to share risk, the partnerships did not trade in consultation with each other, ruinous competition grew. \nAmsterdam merchant Paulo Cloots\u2019 family ties in Antwerp drew him to Belgium in 1717 to participate in the East Indies trade. There he formed a consortium with his brother-in-law, Jacomo Pret, who belonged to Antwerp\u2019s leading mercantile circle. Other participants were <italic>Bruyn</italic> and <italic>Geelhand</italic> of Amsterdam, <italic>Trehee</italic> and Duncombe in-law <italic>Hambly</italic> of London, and the French banker Antoine Crozat. Smaller than Cloots, similar partnerships JVs to explore the East Indies started in Ghent (Jacomo Maelcamp), Ostend (Thomas Ray), and Antwerp (<italic>Moretus</italic>). \nIrish-born Ray arrived in Ostend in 1698. A privateer during the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic>, he captured 20 prizes. From 1710, Ray managed Ostend\u2019s Royal Warehouse, overseeing goods distribution and English ships\u2019 passports until 1713. After promoting a two-year voyage to Surat in 1714, he married the daughter of an Ostend burgomaster. Although the expedition led Ray to seek permission for a joint-stock company, the Antwerp financial lobby thwarted him. The lobby also rejected proposals from John Law\u2019s extended cousin John Ker and Jacomo Maelcamp.\nWhile there were 34 expeditions to Asia between 1715 and 1723, several focused on the Gulf of Guinea. The expeditions focused on trading gold, ivory, and wax, avoiding direct involvement in the slave trade.  Threatening the GWC monopoly, Jan Schonamille and Pieter Woelaerts received official approval to outfit two ships and organized the first Guinea expeditions from Ostend in 1718, with backers including Adriaan Teerling of Zealand, Paulo Cloots and Jacomo Pret of Antwerp, Thomas Ray of Ostend, and SSC Director John Lamb of London. While Cloots advised Woelaerts to equip a new ship after Crozat of France joined, Jacomo Maelcamp of Ghent joined. In 1720, Hermanus Putte founded <italic>Middelburgse Commercie Co</italic>, a major player in the Guinea and West Indies trade.\nEarlier, following the 1699 <italic>P</italic><italic>eace of Karlowitz</italic>, Austria gained Wallachia from Turkey and Emperor Leo granted a princely title to Nicolas Mavrocordato, a descendant of Byzantine Imperial Palaiologos family and brother-in-law of the Ghicas. However, war reignited. In 1716, Court Jew of the Grand Vizier of Constantinople, Chelebi Bally, brought Mavrocordato to Bucharest, where he ascended the Wallachian throne. With a new treaty with the Sultan, Austrian merchants gained reciprocal trading privileges. \nIn 1718, Austria captured Buda and established free trade with Turkey, allowing Turkish Greek and Armenian traders outside of guilds to engage in caravan commerce and corruption across the Balkans. Imperial acts in 1719 and 1725 opened the Austrian Free Port of Trieste to all, increasing competition with Livorno and Venice. In 1719, Emperor Charles VI\u2019s niece married the son of Saxon Elector Augustus II.  To prevent another succession struggle, the Emperor changed succession laws to allow females if no male heirs existed.\nThe political changes combined with mortality to force Austria\u2019s Imperial Court Jewry to re-link. The grandson of Samson Wertheim and the noted Galician Rabbi Gabriel Eskeles, Bernhard was born in 1692 to Baruch, soon the Chief Rabbi of Moravia. After Bernhard married Wertheim\u2019s daughter, he became a Vienna Court Jew. He inherited the Chief Rabbinate of Moravia after Baruch died in 1718. \nAfter his wife Veronica died in 1715, Wertheim married Merle Schiff, widow of Isaac, the son of Johann and Esther Liebman. Working for <italic>Wertheim</italic> until 1709, Isaac Arnstein obtained his own privilege in 1717, and soon became Court Jew to Charles VI\u2019s wife, Amalia. By 1719, Wertheim\u2019s son L\u00f6b married Saxon Court Jew Behrend Lehmann\u2019s daughter. Likewise, Judith Gomperz\u2014a first cousin of Wertheim\u2019s Oppenheim daughter-in-law by way of Judith Gomperz Oppenheim\u2014wed a Dutch Goldsmid in 1720. \nIn 1718, Britain\u2019s new Chancellor supported trustee risk taking, shifting manorial custodianship to capitalism. Increasingly, promoters sold shares for fisheries, funeral furnishes, finance, and trade   unchartered <italic>bubble</italic>. Two of these were large maritime insurers. While Lord Chetwynd\u2019s venture included five SSC directors, Lord Onslow\u2019s board included three EAC directors and Matthew Decker, formerly of SSC and a director of EIC and EAC. Given limited credit of the times, shares had call options, which inflated<italic> Indes</italic>, SSC, and EAC shares through option-like payoffs.\nMoreover, BOE and SSC interlocked directors. In 1719, Huguenot Theodore Janssen resigned from BOE to become a director of SSC. Soon after, a grandson of James Bateman, the deceased Governor of BOE and co-founder of SSC, married Betty Churchill-Spencer, a daughter of the Earl of Sunderland. As Parliament chose SSC over BOE to swap debt, the <italic>Bubbles Act of 1720 </italic>limited judicial aid to charters against<italic> bubbles</italic> competing with the chartered SSC and insurer monopolies for <italic>Royal Assurance</italic> and <italic>Lloyd</italic> against free trade and the Dutch. \nWhile Amsterdam\u2019s financial center opposed <italic>bubbles</italic>, the chartering of joint-stock insurance corporations in Britain in 1720 influenced the Netherlands and Germany. In July 1720, Rotterdam saw the founding of <italic>Stad Rotterdam</italic>, the first Dutch limited liability insurance company, with a Scottish director and over 10% of investors from Britain, including SSC Director John Lamb, EIC director and former SSC Governor Matthew Decker. <italic>Stad </italic>inspired similar ventures in cities like Gouda and Schiedam, with investors including <italic>Hope</italic>. Within six months, 30 towns in Holland granted permission for the floatation of some 40 companies focused on commerce and trade as magistrates pushed the interests of their communities. The expansion spurred Hamburg to regulate the emerging market.\nAlong with <italic>Hope</italic>, many of the Dutch investors were Huguenot and Jewish correspondents for investors in Britain and elsewhere. Stock trading, meanwhile, was rampant. Although <italic>Amsterdam Stock Exchange</italic> had 378 Christian brokers, 33 Jewish brokers\u2014including Mendes, Pereira, Belmonte, Teixeira, Henriques, and DaCosta\u2014there were over a thousand unauthorized brokers. With enforcement of the <italic>Bubbles </italic><italic>Act</italic>, insurer <italic>bubbles</italic> deflated, dragging along SSC. As investors across Europe sold SSC shares, the English <italic>pound</italic> depreciated as investors flocked to the safety of gold and the reserve currency of AWB. \nLaw\u2019s monopoly over French finance alienated Huguenot bankers, including Isaac Thellusson of Geneva\u2014married to a niece of the Dutch Mennonite banker in Paris Theodore Hulst\u2014who bought SSC and shorted <italic>Indes </italic>out of Amsterdam. Since British Huguenot and SSC Director John Lamb exported French gold to Britain, Law had him expelled for trying to break the FX in 1719. While initially supporting Law\u2019s Louisiana ventures the Swiss and leaving Spain, disposed Irishman Richard Cantillon intermediate among shorts with his relatives across Paris, Amsterdam, and London. \nWhen Parisian bankers accused him of usury and fraud, Cantillon was arrested and imprisoned in the Ch\u00e2telet in 1719 for a day. After another brief imprisonment, Cantillon sold his bank, Cantillon left Paris for Italy. Within months, Cantillon to Paris and made a fortune. While his descendants include British and French aristocracy, John Law abjured his Protestant faith. As his ban on speculation failed, Law raised interest rates, deflating <italic>Indes</italic>. As Thellusson advised the Regent, and received financial privileges from the Controller General of Finances in supplying gold to the French treasury.\nAmidst the currency swings, Huguenots developed Irish banking. While Houblon cousin John Lordell was a BOE director, he was related to the co-religionist Huguenot Touche family. While some of his family converted to Catholicism following the revocation of the <italic>Edict of Nantes</italic>, David Touche joined his uncle in Amsterdam and traveled to England in the service of Stadtholder William of Orange and Mary Stuart. He later settled in Dublin and began trading linen and joined the Weavers\u2019 Guild in 1701. After becoming the Guild\u2019s Master in 1708, he joined the Guild of Merchants by 1717. He established a banking house by 1719 and discounted bills linked to the linen trade in Cork, Limerick, and Lisburn, but did not issue notes like his competitors.\nBOE subscribed to support SSC\u2019s share price, but before this settled, the goldsmiths and private bankers who advanced on SSC stock ran on SSC\u2019s bank, <italic>Sword Blade</italic>, which suspended. The run subsequently spread to BOE, which used its capital to support SSC through purchases of subscriptions and bonds. Since SSC shares were backed by the government liabilities that they sought to reply, a bankruptcy of SSC would be akin to national bankruptcy and so, in late 1720, <italic>Parliament</italic> issued a general pardon for crimes committed before July 24 and allowed landowners to reorg. \nAlthough the law was modified to make SSC\u2019s Caswell the first member of the House of Commons to be declared bankrupt, <italic>Sword Blade</italic> operated for decades. While SSC\u2019s Treasurer Knight unsuccessfully absconded, he was imprisoned along with John Blunt, John Lamb, and other SSC directors, but they were soon released. While John Lamb left for France, he died soon after, and his son founded <italic>Lamb</italic> bank in Paris. \nThe President of SSC\u2019s South American trading post pawned his belongings to avoid bankruptcy and became a renowned physician. Deputy Cashier Robert Surman was arrested but later returned to future-<italic>Martin</italic> and became a Partner. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1720</italic>, Robert Walpole, who had served as Chancellor of the <italic>Exchequer</italic> from 1715 to 1717, conferred with Abraham Wagg of London, a Katz, Goldschmidt, and Hart cousin. Fostering strong relationships within Parliament and leveraging the political instability, Walpole returned to the chancellorship in 1721 and consolidated power to become the first PM of Britain.\nWhile West Indies-born Sephardi Samson Gideon was among the most successful investors in London, his warnings did not stop Suasso-in-law Anthony Mendes DaCosta from realizing losses. Continental co-religionists faced tribulations. Amidst the crisis in Amsterdam, an antisemitic riot erupted on a French coffeehouse. By October 1720, Amsterdam prohibited non-sworn brokers to limit the hundreds of unauthorized brokers. \nThe depressed credit also drive the <italic>Northern War </italic>to end in 1721, and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s son Emmanuel died within days. The uncertainty over the new debts and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s old debts drove Lipman Cohen-Behrens and his sons in Hannover, Behrend Lehmann in Dresden, and Nathan Goldschmidt of Frankfurt to default. Implication in fraud led two of Cohen-Behrens\u2019 sons to endure five years of torture before being banished from Hanover. While German courts also persecuted Lehmann\u2019s son-in-law L\u00f6b Wertheim as if combating a family conspiracy, he had strong support from Joseph Oppenheim and the Austrian authorities. \nWhile Behrend Lehmann sought to sell his Polish estates from 1722, Stanislaw Leszczy\u0144ski regained control soon after. In Vienna, however, Emmanuel\u2019s widow Judith Gomperz Oppenheim took over and became one of Austria\u2019s five dominant Court Jews. Judith\u2019s brother, meanwhile, became Rabbi of <italic>Hambros Synagogue</italic>\u2014founded by Glikl Goldschmidt\u2019s son-in-law Mordecai Hamburger in London\u2014from 1725, in competition with the <italic>Great Synagogue</italic> with dispute of Aaron as the first Chief Rabbi of Britain. Still, Britain struggled with the reverberations from the <italic>Panic of 1720</italic> and continuing antisemitism. \nIn Britain, Parliament exempted English manors from bankruptcy in 1723. After forcing out the Chancellor in 1725, the new Chancellor reversed the law and held trustees liable for the trust. This fostered a shift into <italic>Exchequer </italic>securities and, in disrupting credit, bankruptcies and famine returned. As SSC was separate from BOE, scandal did not ensnare BOE. In 1727, Anthony Mendes, BOE director and descendant of the Duke of Naxos, sued British Baltic trade monopoly <italic>Russia Co</italic> for refusing him membership due to his Jewish identity. The Attorney General ruled in his favor, leading the company to petition Parliament to change its charter. \nMendes, Mocatta, DaCosta, and Teixeira in-laws continued to drive BOE\u2019s silver bullion trade. Not limiting themselves to the Anglo-Dutch, the families kinterlinked with international Sephardi. Since Abraham Mocatta married the daughter of Abraham Levy-Ximenes in 1712, their daughter Sarah married Isaac Levy-Ximenes and, after his death, Moses Lumbroso-Mattos, an immigrant from the Medici stronghold of Tuscan Port of Livorno, in 1730. While another daughter married an Abrabanel descendant in 1735, Levy-Ximenes and Teixeira kinterlinked by 1748. After Abraham Mocatta died, his son-in-law Moses ran <italic>Mocatta</italic>. While Moses\u2019 son followed, he later adopted the Mocatta surname.\nSince British slave trader Humphry Morice became a BOE director in 1716, he rose to Deputy Governor in 1725, and Governor from 1727 until 1729. Facing financial difficulties, he resorted to issuing promissory notes instead of cash to his captains. His death in 1731 was followed by revelations of financial fraud involving fictitious bills. Despite Parliament\u2019s 1711 anti-combination law, English coal cartels controlled 67% in 1729. So, Parliament passed more anti-combination laws. As taxes eliminated savings, the <italic>Bubble Act</italic> remained in force\u2014requiring Parliamentary approval for negotiable joint-stock endeavors\u2014most other enterprises were forced to be partnerships. From 1734, <italic>Parliament</italic> limited stock jobbing and short selling. Although the practices continued, the act added risk by being unenforceable in court. \nWhile London financed Irish coal ventures,<italic> </italic><italic>Burton</italic> discounted their bills in Dublin until failing in 1733. Instead, the Huguenot Guild Master David Touche expanded from linen discounting to issuing notes and becoming the dominant Irish private banker. Although continuing to face limitations imposed by stock exchanges and other male-only guilds, British and Dutch women, especially widows, had greater involvement in retail and high-quality manufacturing, and played an active role in financial and mortgage markets. After inheriting an iron business in South Yorkshire by the 1730s, Parkin\u2019s circulating credit fueled industry as she reinvested to restore and manage estates, turnpikes, and other shipping improvement. \nSince <italic>Indes </italic>controlled France\u2019s central bank, her collapse enveloped France\u2019s financial system in fraud, limiting innovation. Bordeaux<italic> </italic>thrived with the fall of the<italic> Indes</italic>\u2019<italic> </italic>transatlantic slave trade monopoly. Out of 500 large business houses in Bordeaux, only 30 were Jewish, with 4 trading with colonies. Only <italic>Gradis</italic> and <italic>Mendez</italic> outfitted more than one slave ship. Since Bordeaux allowed Jews to continue their commercial activities after Louis XIV revoked religious tolerance of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the King extended royal decrees specifically to the Sephardim of Bordeaux in 1723, officially securing their status in the region.\nBordeaux-born Sephardi David Gradis formed <italic>Gradis</italic> in 1696 to trade wine, sugar, armaments, and, to a small extent, slaves. His son Abraham took over <italic>Gradis</italic> management in 1722, he branched to Saint-Domingue and Martinique in 1724. Like Huguenots, <italic>Gradis</italic> traded with anyone, collaborating with Jewish shipping bankers Joseph Peixotto of Amsterdam and Samuel Alexandre of Bayonne, French Huguenot merchants <italic>Ergas</italic> and <italic>Silvera</italic>, and trading Jesuit fathers Jean-Baptiste LaBrosse and Charles Chavigny in Canada.\nAlthough French industry lacked financing technology, nobles still invested. In 1744, the Duke of Croy and the Marquess of Cernay acquired major shares in France\u2019s largest mine was <italic>Anzin</italic>, and the Castries and Solages families controlled <italic>Grand Combe</italic> and <italic>Carmaux</italic> mining operations. The Count of Artois and the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans engaged in <italic>Javel </italic>acid production in 1777, glassmaking at <italic>Villers-Cotteret</italic>, and cotton spinning at <italic>Orl\u00e9ans</italic>. Noble families like the Lameths and Gouy d\u2019Arsys had extensive plantations in the colonies. Courtiers obtained shares in <italic>Ferme G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, with Talleyrand known for speculative ventures. <italic>Saint-Gobain</italic> included board members like the Duke of Montmorency and of S\u00e9gur and LaVieuville family members.\nAmidst ruinous competition in the Ostend trade, Emperor Charles VI of Austria chartered <italic>Ostend</italic><italic> Co</italic><italic> </italic>in 1722, joining a consortium of Belgian and Irish merchants. Among them were Irish privateer Thomas Ray and Belgian Receiver General Adrien Walckiers, with expeditions to Bengal and China from 1724. Since John Law\u2019s extended cousin John Ker pursued an Ostend trading venture, he faced challenges in securing financial and pollical backing, culminating in the venture\u2019s failure and his imprisonment in London\u2019s debtor\u2019s prison. \nWhile the death of Antwerpian Paulo Cloots within a year drained Ostend venture interest, mounting diplomatic pressures from Britain and France culminated in the revocation of the company\u2019s charter for seven years under the <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> in 1727. Despite efforts to resume operations, the company faced a permanent ban with the <italic>Second Treaty of Vienna</italic> in 1731 as Austria yielded to European powers\u2019 interests in maintaining the status quo of colonial trade dominance.\nHowever, mounting diplomatic pressures from Britain and France culminated in the revocation of the company\u2019s charter for seven years under the <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> in 1727. Despite efforts to resume operations, the company faced a permanent ban with the <italic>Second Treaty of Vienna</italic> in 1731 as Austria yielded to European powers\u2019 interests in maintaining the status quo of colonial trade dominance. While Catholic nobility was generally disinterested in industrial investment, the Emperor continued to invest, including in a venture industrializing Bohemia that managed the Linz woolen fabrics company as well as the Schwechat cotton factory.\nIn China Port of Canton, EIC trade concerned VOC since 1715, who feared losing their monopoly on copper trade from Japan to India. From 1724, Japan developed a banking system with regulated interest rates, protecting borrowers from excessive charges. That same year, Kung, the 60th descendant of Confucius, assumed an administrative position in Canton and implemented protectionist reforms. By 1728, he recommended trading only with reputable merchants and required Dutch supervision. While VOC reaffirmed the 1644 ban of slaves, mixed-race people, and their spouses from travel to Europe in 1713, Batavian authorities extended the 1672 ban on Asian clerks to European descendants in 1718. \nSince the 17th century, Sephardi international networks across Livorno, Lisbon, Goa, and Amsterdam dominated the trade of coral and diamonds against EIC until to the 1740s. In Portuguese South India, Sephardi David Rahabi became a wealthy merchant in Cochin after leaving Turkish Syria in 1646. His son Ezekiel became a merchant, diplomat, and trusted agent for VOC as Rajah of Cochin, securing commercial treaties and pepper contracts, the primary focus of VOC in Malabar. He engaged with native rulers, including the King of Travancore and the Zamorin of Calicut from 1723 to 1771. \nFrom the mid-18th century, Jewish diamond merchants shifted their operations from Amsterdam to London under British control, establishing a silver-coral-diamond trade network that routed silver through Leghorn, and supplied Europe\u2019s royal courts through Antwerp-based cutting factories and expert Court Jews. Glikl Goldschmidt\u2019s grandson Marcus Hamburger and other Ashkenazi merchants from Hamburg began buying Indian diamonds in London before relocating to British India. But after diamonds were discovered in Brazil, he died destitute in Madras around 1735.\nAcross in the East Indies, local diaspora bankers worked with EIC and VOC. The Marwaris, originating from Rajasthan, engaged in long-range trade and finance in North India. During From the 16th century, semi-permanent migrant communities began to form outside their homeland. Since the 1680s, Marwari Jain Manik Chand funded the Muslim Prince Farrukhsiyar to become the Central Asian Turkic Mughal Emperor in Northeast India in 1707. While EIC hoped to mint coinage in India, Emperor Farrukhsiyar gave a monopoly over the Murshidabad and Dhaka mints to Fatehchand of the Chand family, who received the hereditary title of <italic>Jagat Seth</italic> or \u2018Banker of the World\u2019 in 1722. Like other court bankers, Jagat Seths facilitated tax remittance from eastern India to Delhi and Lahore.\nUnder the Muslim regime, however, high-caste Hindus shunned banking and business. Since the Brahmin landlord Tagore family settled in Bengal in the late 18th century, they collected taxes for the Muslim rulers. For this impurity, the Tagore fell from grace and were ostracized. Brahmin played a greater role in the mostly Hindu Maratha Empire. By the late 17th century, EIC\u2019s first official bankers at Surat\u2014the house of Arjunji Nathji Travedi\u2014became notable for employing Nagar Brahmins as its first bankers, establishing a foundation for financial activities in the region. The economic landscape shifted significantly in 1713 when the Maratha king Shahu appointed Balaji Vishwanath Bhat as Peshwa (PM). This led to the rise of savakars (moneylenders) and traders, particularly from the Chitpavan and Deshastha Brahmin communities, who financed the Maratha Empire and contributed to Pune\u2019s emergence as a financial metropolis by 1740, housing over 150 savakars.\nKhwaja Minas, a prominent Armenian merchant from Persian Isfahan traded had contacts from Russia to Bombay, and across the South China Seas to Manila traded with local merchants and EIC during the 17th century. His influence was evident from his position as the \u2018President of the Armenians\u2019 in Surat and corresponding with the Russian Tsar. Upon his death in 1700, he left his fortune to his sons. \nArmenians engaged extensively in financial dealings with foreigners in Northwest India, preferring transactions over trading partnerships with non-Armenians. They relied on Hindu bankers known for financial expertise. The Armenians operated a flexible credit system, securing loans beyond actual capital based on reputation and association with prominent firms. Women played an active role in borrowing and lending, with some taking substantial loans and participating in family business. Foreigners, including Dutch agents and European consuls, married into Armenian families, showing integration between communities. \nAmerican colonies, including Rhode Island, also issued land bank-backed paper from 1710. But as Abraham Redwood\u2014a Quaker heir to a Caribbean sugar plantation and in-law of a Howland cousin descended from Rhode Island\u2019s first Governor\u2014and other merchants protested to London in 1730, no action was taken as the banks continued helping landowners monetize their wealth. After Virginia declared annual interest rates over 6% usurious in 1730, she declared that lands, houses, and slaves were not assets and hence not liable for the payment of debts. \nSo British merchant creditors\u2014themselves liable for involuntary bankruptcy\u2014lobbied for the <italic>Act of 1732</italic>, which had the effect of institutionalizing slave auctions and monetizing slaves to protect loan collateral. While the <italic>Marriage Act of 1753</italic> aimed to regulate marriage, wife sales persisted into the 19th century, partly due to the decline of ecclesiastical courts. Unlike bankruptcy, divorces remained expensive and limited in Britain, with wife sales and public auctions being a popular means of separation.\nAnd as EIC began competing with the Dutch trade of Japanese copper in India by 1731, France reorganized <italic>Indies</italic> and legalized Black slave trade, but trailed Britain and Portugal. Since the early 17th century, Portuguese prazos\u2014land grants to Europeans, Indians, and mixed race overlords control over local Africans and slaves\u2014institutionalized using inter-racial family networks. Although American Quakers were actively involved in importing small lots of slaves from the West Indies for personal use until the 1730s, the trade shifted to larger cargoes afterward, which ultimately fueled Quaker abolitionist sentiment. While Rhode Island\u2019s Redwood attempted to trade slaves but found it unprofitable.\nWhile both White and Black slave traders gained wealth, the latter also acquired land. However, Black slave traders faced the additional risk of enslavement. Ayuba Diallo was born in Bundu, near Sierra Leone, to a Fulbe Islamic leader. In 1730, while selling slaves, he was captured by the Manlinke and sold to a British slaver. Enslaved in Maryland, his literacy helped gain his freedom in 1733 after EAC Deputy Governor James Oglethorpe purchased his freedom for \u00a345. After a brief stay in Britain, he returned to Bundu in 1735 with \u00a3500 in gifts.\nBefore significant European trade in the 16th century, the Akan of the Gold Coast in modern Ghana traded gold, kola nuts, and salt with the Sudanese states. The Akan exchanged forest goods for Mande and Hausa manufactures. Unlike in Dahomey, in present-day Benin, Akan chiefs did not monopolize resources. Lacking standing armies, the Asante, Denkyira, and Akyem encouraged trade for firearms. Chiefs handled war captives and ivory from warfare and tribute, but gold mining was open to all, though chiefs taxed output. \nControlling trade routes along the eastern coast of the Gold Coast, the Akwamu engaged in the trade of gold, ivory, and slaves with European traders. Founded around the 16th century by migrants from Adanse, the Akwamu expanded under King Ansa Sasraku, capturing and annexing Accra. However, internal disputes and external pressures from the Asante and European powers led to its decline. During this period, the slave fort of Anomabu became pivotal in the transatlantic slave trade, coveted by both French and British companies.\nIn the early 18th century, conflicts between Denkyira and Assin, Akwamu and Akyem, and later Asante and the Fante states aimed to control trade routes. Chiefs placed agents at coastal towns to secure access, with trade conducted by both rulers and commoners, mainly through family groups, and traders moved unarmed under peace agreements.\nInitially monopolized by EAC, Anomabu became a site of resistance. There, Fante Chief Enobaisie Kurentsi played significant roles in local governance, military affairs, and trade by the 1730s. Kurentsi governed in consultation with other heads of families, forming a council akin to a senate or regency. His mastery of trade in commodities like gold and slaves ensured his significance in regional commerce. To enhance alliances with coastal elites, he married the daughter of Akwamu King Sasraku. Their daughter married British fort officer Richard Brew, and their mixed-race family facilitated African and British trade by kinterlinking with the Chief of Asante and serving as clerks.\nTo build relations with Europe, Kurentsi sent one son to France and another, William Ansah Sessarakoo, to Britain in the 1740s. On its way to Britain, the ship carrying William put in at Barbados with a cargo of slaves, where its duplicitous captain sold William into slavery. Kurentsi refused further commerce with the British until his son was rescued. Redeemed by merchants backed by the British government, William and his companion were baptized, educated, and entertained in elite social circles in London under the protection of the Earl of Halifax before he returned to Africa in 1750. Amidst British and French competition for control, Kurentsi granted EAC permission to build a fort in 1753 while securing a degree of autonomy for Anomabu. \nMeanwhile, Court Jews married per European politics. Since Samson Wertheim married Merle Schiff, widow of Isaac, the son of Johann and Esther Liebman in 1715, he died in 1724. Merle\u2019s daughter with Isaac, Judith, married Mayer Hirschel, who continued being Mint Jews of Breslau, the thriving trade capital of feudal Catholic Silesia. After the deaths of Isaac Arnstein\u2019s wife in 1723 and Samson Wertheim a year later, Arnstein\u2019s daughter married Emmanuel and Judith Oppenheim\u2019s son in 1725. Arnstein later married the daughter of Merle and Isaac Liebman. \nEmmanuel\u2019s nephew Moses Oppenheim married Lea Hirschel of Breslau. As successor to Wertheim as Chief Rabbi of Hungary, the Emperor appointed Bernhard Eskeles. Samson Wertheim\u2019s son Wolf became Court Jew of Bavaria and moved to the Imperial City of Augsburg. As Wolf\u2019s sister had wed Lipman Cohen-Behrens\u2019 son, her cousin-in-law was Glikl Goldschmidt\u2019s son had married a daughter of the Court Jew of the Margrave of Bayreuth around northern Bavaria, himself becoming a Court Jew and Land Rabbi of Bayreuth by 1728. And in 1729, Arnstein became Habsburg\u2019s Imperial Court Jew. Over the following decades, his children married his niece-in-law Veronika Pressburger, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s grandson Emanuel Oppenheim, Benedikt Gomperz\u2019s daughter, and Frankfurt banking heirs Moses Beyfus, Lema Hahn, and Moses Scheuer.\nWinning the <italic>Northern War </italic>by 1721, Russian Tsar Peter Romanov monopolized the authority to designate successors. As Isay Liebman moved to Saint-Petersburg, Peter\u2019s niece Anna of Courland retained Court Junker Ernst Biron and coupled with Maurice of Saxony, an illegitimate son of Augustus II of Poland, who claimed Tobago. However, Saint-Petersburg intervened and voided the election, leading Russia\u2019s expedition to shift from the Caribbean to Alaska. After Peter death, his widow Catherine ruled for two years until her death in 1725. As Anna seized the throne, she expelled Jews in 1727 to deflect attention from the growth of Lutherans. \nSince Liebman gained exemption, silver supplier Zundel Girsh petitioned to stay to honor his contract with Old Believer merchant Andrei Simonov. The Court allowed Girsh to stay until the contract ended. While legalizing a Russian form of bills of exchange, <italic>veksels</italic>, for merchants in 1729, specifically prohibiting serfs. Blaming Poland for dumping copper coins, the government stopped accepting it as tax payment as early as 1730. But like serfs continued to use <italic>veksels</italic>, so did low quality coin inflation.  \nAnna\u2019s ascension to the throne in 1730 also redirected focus towards naval power and expansion. Collaborative efforts with Britain in America challenged Spain\u2019s empire, resulting in Russian advances in Alaska, British exploration in the Caribbean and Rio de la Plata in Portuguese Brazil. Despite Anna expulsion of Jews in 1727, Isay Liebman remained Court Jew, facilitating the acquisition of diamonds and jewelry for them, managing the finances of Courland under Biron\u2019s trust, transferring diplomatic funds to Poland in 1733 following the death of Augustus II and the <italic>War of the Polish Succession</italic> against the former King of Poland Stanislaw Leszczy\u0144ski and his son-in-law, Louis XV of France.\nWhen some Jews built a synagogue and converted to Christianity, Tsarina Anna had them executed. However, Isaac petitioned on behalf of the Jewish community to and obtained permission for Jews to live in Saint-Petersburg and Moscow, despite the general prohibition on Jewish residency. In 1734, he became the official supplier to the court and engaged in various financial activities. The same year, she overturned Peter\u2019s primogeniture law of 1714 into partible inheritance, shrinking estates over time.\nTo gain access to the Black Sea, Russia joined with Austria against Turkey from 1735 and put the order of 1727 banishing Jews went into abeyance. In 1738, when the burning at the stake in Saint-Petersburg of a Jew convicted of heresy placed his fellow Jews in jeopardy, Lipman Cohen-Behrens cousin Isay Liebman imported commodities and negotiated with the Austrian treasury to upkeep Russian auxiliary forces. However, with the end of the Turkish war, reactivating the order banishing the Jews. Following Anna\u2019s death, Biron was banished to Siberia. Isaac was not targeted, and he continued his business under regency of the infant Ivan VI. \nAs former Tsar Peter Romanov\u2019s cousin Elizabeth overthrew Ivan and declared herself Tsarina of Russia in 1741, she expelled Isay Liebman and other Jews by 1744, ending the term of Russia\u2019s first and last unbaptized Court Jew. He died shortly after. But Russia\u2019s growing entrepreneurship boosted trade and eased inflation. While Elizabeth removed internal tariffs with Russian Ukraine, trade remained slow due to rapids and a lack of Black Sea ports. Along with turning over state-owned metal works and alcohol monopolies to the gentry, Elizabeth chartered <italic>Commercial Bank</italic> to fund enterprise and <italic>Noble</italic><italic> Bank</italic> to monetize estates in 1754. However, there were few laws to secure mortgages.\nWhile Russia could not access Dutch capital, the British <italic>Russia Co</italic><italic> </italic>reorganized to take advantage. John Cayley,  an Anglican descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, joined <italic>Russia Co</italic> in 1754 after apprenticing with <italic>Napier Hassenfeller</italic>. Two years later, he married a daughter of Richard Cozens\u2014Tsar Peter shipbuilder\u2014related to the Raike and Gomm families. Through the Wrangham sisters, the Raikes were related to <italic>Russia Co</italic>\u2019s Wilberforce and Thornton cousins, who also kinterlinked with <italic>Smyth</italic>  in 1756. \nIn Poland, meanwhile, since Radziwill warred with Lords Pac and Lords Potockis and Czartoryski into the 18th century, a largely marriage-based confederation coalesced. Following centuries of civil war, the Radziwills, Sapiehas, and Czartoryskis families inter-married to control plantations and towns. As Maria Radziwill Czartoryski amassed landholdings, she leveraged Court Jews to shape the political and economic landscape. Likewise, the indebted Mikolaj and Barbara Radziwill controlled Berdichev in Polish Ukraine. One of the most prosperous Radziwill cousins inherited the Neswisch estate in Belarus. \nWhile excluded from the Baltic grain trade, Jews traded for the benefit of magnates. Across Poland, plantation-owning lords restricted Jewish activities, controlling taxes, settlement rights, economic activities, synagogue organization. While some royal commissioners defended Jewish rights complaints from Christian burghers about Jewish trade practices, the prevailing trend was a growing intrusion of non-Jewish authorities into Jewish communal affairs. Magnate interests prioritized law and order, commerce, and revenue generation, instead of traditional Jewish rights or autonomy. Like the Radziwills and their agents enforced debt collection among Jews, they intervened on the behalf of Jewish merchants against mistreatment from nobles.\nIn-laws of the Radziwill and Katz families aligned across Poland. Since Tatar attacks nearly destroyed the Church-owned town of Opatow of Little Poland in the 16th century, Bishop Teodoryk sold the town in 1514 to a lord. Divided upon the lord\u2019s death in 1532, Opatow was consolidated by Janusz Ostrogski by 1595, becoming second in size and prestige only to the capital, Krakau. \nAs the Lords allowed Jews to settle, 200 wealthy Jewish families soon populated the town, almost all were violently murdered during the Chmielnicki massacres of the 1650s. By the 1700s, ownership of the town passed along his family to Pawel Sanguszko, whose sister wed Karol Radziwill. As Jews resettled, Opatow became one of a dozen cities with over 2,000 Jews by the 1750s. During fairs in Leipzig, Breslau, and Oder, merchants traded German goods with the local small traders on credit. \nBy the 17th century, the Luria cousin Landau family attained prominence in the Council of Four Lands and rabbinates and kahal across at least 20 other communities. Through strategic marital alliances with Katz Wahl, Halpern, Horowitz, and other families, Landau expanded their reach beyond Opatow to Tykocin, Hamburg, and Prague. Through the late 18th century, Katz-Landau descendants dominated Jewish life in Opatow. The life-long kahal member, Judah Landau was also a deputy of the Council of Four Lands.\nBy the 1720s, Jewish merchants dissented against the Landaus\u2019 control over communal life. While Pawel Sanguszko\u2019s comptroller accused Judah Landau of not being accountable for negotiating loans and mismanaging kahal funds, Judah\u2019s brother Isaac violated the rule against consecutive terms and controlled kahal elections, leading to tensions and violence in 1726. As the rabbi, Landau enjoyed a tax exemption, and expanded commercial activities after resigning, prompting the kahal to demand tax payment or cease trade. \nIn the kahal election of 1728, critics attempted to curb Landau\u2019s influence, leading Pawel Sanguszko to order a rerun of election, mandate Isaac pay taxes, and restrict Judah\u2019s participation in the regional council. Judah\u2019s death in 1738 triggered a conflict over his son-in-law, whom Sanguszko banished. However, after another violent conflict erupted stemming from Landau\u2019s control of kahal offices and tax distribution in 1744, Sanguszko supported the Landau power monopoly and punished several of their critics. While Landaus remained in power, Judah\u2019s son Ezekiel left to become Rabbi of Yampol.\nWhen Karol Radziwill died in 1719, his bequeathed most of his estates to his son Michal and several to his widow, Pawel\u2019s sister Anna Sanguszko Radziwill. Many of Anna\u2019s estates were around Belarus, including Mir, Biala Podlaska, and Sluzk. While Lithuania\u2019s Jewish council separated from Poland in 1623, a council formed with three main communities: Brest, Grodno, and Pinsk. Wilna became the fourth in 1670, and Sluzk joined as the fifth main community in 1691. By then, Katz Wahl-in-law Naftali Gunzburg died after over a decade of service and was replaced by Yitzchak Teomin Frankel, a Katz Wahl descendant and relative of Court Jew Koppel Frankel, who had served as Rabbi of \u017bolkow before leaving for Pinsk. \nTeomin Frankel was followed by a Luria cousin of the Benveniste-Mendes and a succession of short terms until Yehuda Enzel, whose mother descended from Lemberg\u2019s Rabbi Abraham Rappaport\u2019s cousin. Marrying a Katz-Rappaport, Yehuda served for over a decade until 1722. Following two more short term rabbis, Haim Rappaport, Yehuda\u2019s uncle-once removed and a husband of Luria, became Sluzk\u2019s Rabbi from 1730. While Haim\u2019s sons became Rabbi of Glogau and Head of Lemberg\u2019s yeshiva, his daughters married into the Katz and Gunzburg families. As Haim departed Sluzk to be Rabbi of Lemberg in 1740, Yitzhak Teomin Frankel\u2019s grandnephew Isaak took over with the aid of his father-in-law, Shmuel Ickowicz. \nAt the time, Landau and other elite rabbinical families faced competition from Hasidism, started by Katz descendant Rabbi Israel Eliezer (\u201cBaal Shem Tov\u201d), a charismatic miracle worker. Following the destruction of the <italic>Northern War</italic>, Anna sought to rebuild by leasing Mir and Biala Podlaska in 1726 to brothers Shmuel and Gdal Ickowicz, who left their father\u2019s leasehold in the Radziwill estates of Volhynia. After expanding leases, Shmuel is said to have been inspired by Baal Shem Tov to relocate to Sluzk in 1733, where he became the Cashier in 1736 and his brother a factor and distillation and mill manager. For trade with Saint-Petersburg, the brothers corresponded directly with Isay Liebman, the Court Jew of Russia.\nLike Anna, Jewish women played an important role. For example, Michal\u2019s wife had a female agent Malka who sourced kitchen and other supplies for her. During business trips, Shmuel\u2019s entrusted his wife Henia with full authority to negotiate and disburse funds. While Gdal\u2019s wife negotiated and contracted with Jewish merchants of eastern Belarus, his daughter commercially corresponded from Valozhyn.\nUpon Anna\u2019s retirement in 1740, the brothers worked for her son, Hieronim, eventually leasing all his estates. Along with funding Hieronim\u2019s army training school in Sluzk, the brothers secured rabbinic roles for their family. While Shmuel\u2019s new son-in-law Isaak Teomin Frankel became Rabbi of Sluzk in 1740, a more prestigious post opened in 1741. Upon the baptism of his brother in 1741, prominent Jews called for the resignation of the Rabbi of Krakau, including Chaskiel Landau of Tarnow, Ezekiel Landau of Opatow, and three of the four Jewish leaders of Krakau. \nWhile the Landaus claimed the post based on their historical contributions to the leadership of the Jewish community in the region and the lineage of rabbis within their family, Shmuel Ickowicz acquired the post for Teomin Frankel. By 1743, Gdal bought the Wilna rabbinate for his son-in-law Nahman Katz (of unknown lineage). By then, Gdal became Court Jew of K\u00f6nigsberg, Shmuel with Prussian Court Jew Ephraim, and betrothed his daughter to one of Ephraim\u2019s sons. However, Russia\u2019s expulsion of Court Jew Isay Liebman cut off ties with Saint-Petersburg in 1744.\nFacing mounting debts, Hieronim Radziwill accused the Ickowicz family of embezzlement and seized their Ephraim dowery and Polish and Prussian assets with support from the Landaus. With backing from the King of Prussia, Ephraim paralyzed trade between Hieronim\u2019s estates and the Port of K\u00f6nigsberg with a lien. From Vienna, Isay Liebman called for the release of the Ickowiczs. Despite compromising, Shmuel and his father died after a year in prison. Rabbi Nahman Katz was dismissed from Wilna. \nIsaak Teomin Frankel, having lost the Sluzk and Krakau rabbinates\u2014the former to a Katz-descendant who wed Haim Rappaport\u2019s niece and the latter to Ezekiel Landau\u2019s cousin\u2014settled in Breslau and later became the Chief Rabbi of Silesia. However, Sluzk\u2019s revenues plummeted. Hieronim\u2019s debts pressed on until he inherited the assets of a cousin who had been declared insane. As Hieronim died by 1760, his brother Michal inherited his land. Since Michal died two years later, his son inherited over a thousand cities and villages. Moreover, the power of the Landaus over cities like Opatow faded with the rise of Hasidism. Among the key promoters of Hasidism in Poland was Uzziel Meisel, a Luria descendant of the Meisel family.\nAcross the continent, bankers and tyrants fell as well. As the Persian Empire extended from Azerbaijan to Afghanistan, Armenian <italic>Minas</italic> flourished. After the Shia Safavid Shah lost control as Sunni Afghans invaded in 1722, he rewarded tribal chieftain Thamas Khan of Turkmen for clearing the invaders by making him governor of Khurasan, Kirman, Sistan, and Mazandaran. Minting his own coins, Khan drove the Ottomans out of Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, and penetrated through the Caucasus to Daghistan. Assuming the Persian throne in 1737, Tahmas Khan adopted the name of Nadir Shah. Within two years, he forced the Mughals to pay tribute and cede provinces in the north and west. \nWhile Nadir exempted Persians from taxes for three years, his character deteriorated after suspecting his son of an assassination attempt in 1741. The thriving trade hub of Isfahan began declining in 1745, as Nadir\u2019s taxes devastated the economy. Facing rebellion in Sistan, and elsewhere, Nadir returning to Isfahan in 1747, and extracted vast sums of money cruelly. He ordered the torture, eye gouging, and public burning alive of Minas and another Armenian, four Jews, and two Zoroastrian Parsee over a horsecloth dispute. As Nadir slaughtered his way to Mashhad and, a group of his bodyguards assassinated him to end his tyranny. Still, Armenians continued to flee, and the Persian government remained unstable.\n\n\n<italic>Politics & Panics</italic>\nMeanwhile, Emperor Charles VI continued exploiting Jews. In Bohemia, he imposed restrictions on Jewish marriages. Since the 17th century, Wolf Popper served as the Lords\u2019 Jew for Count Kollowrat of Bresnitz, collecting the Jewish Leibmaut, or body tax, from rural Bohemian Jews. By the late 1720s, he had become Primator of Bohemian rural Jews, granting him residency privileges in Prague\u2019s ghetto. Likewise, Sephardi Diego Aguilar leased Austria\u2019s tobacco monopoly for decades from 1725. \nAfter severing as Court Jew for various German states, Wolf Schlesinger\u2019s son took over the Spanish crown debt in 1726. But he died in a year. His brother Marx, meanwhile, parlayed lead, copper, tin, and gunpowder from Poland to Austria via Polish Jewish merchants. As a Court Jew of many princes simultaneously, Samson Wertheim\u2019s son Wolf became the first Court Jew of Bavaria, but faced challenges as the Emperor forced him to lend money and threatened to confiscate Wertheim\u2019s house in 1726. While the loan drove him into insolvency, Wolf continued banking until Bavaria defaulted in 1733 and liquidated loans for two decades. \nIn 1733, the Catholic Duke Karl Alexander took control of W\u00fcrttemberg and hired Court Jew Joseph-S\u00fcss Oppenheim\u2014Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s great-nephew and Samson Wertheim\u2019s cousin\u2014who was at that time Chief Minister of Finance & War for the Palatinate and Treasury Agent for spiritual princes of Cologne. To furnish material and grain during <italic>Polish-French War</italic>, Joseph-S\u00fcss ran the Mint of Stuttgart. Likewise, his half-brother converted to Christianity and worked as a Hessian Court factor in Darmstadt. By 1736, W\u00fcrttemberg granted rights for Jewish residents in Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg in 1736 under Joseph-S\u00fcss\u2019 authority.\nHowever, when Duke Alexander suffered a stroke in 1737, Joseph-S\u00fcss\u2019 debtors accused him of embezzlement and fraud. Through four months of arrest and daily interrogations, he refused to convert, and so was hung on the gallows in front of 12,000 onlookers. The same year, Genoa expelled her Jews. Months later, in Vienna, Joseph-S\u00fcss\u2019 cousin-in-law Emmanuel Oppenheim\u2019s widow Judith Gomperz died in relative poverty. \nSo did Isaac Oppenheim and his Hirschel wife by 1741. As Isaac Liebman and Merle Schiff Wertheim\u2019s daughter Judith died in 1737, her husband Mayer Hirschel fled Vienna. Hirschel disappeared from Vienna finances. Despite marrying the Court Jew of Saxony Behrend Lehmann\u2019s daughter, another Hirschel left Vienna for Moravia across the Danube River. Likewise, Schlesinger shifted to Berlin as their Vienna lease expired. \nSince the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic>, Charles VI\u2019s sister, Archduchess Maria led Belgium and Protestant bankers replaced Court Jews. Viennese Court bankers depended on Jean-Baptiste Cogels and Pietro Proli. After their deaths, their widows took over their banks. While the bankers worked with Mathias Nettine, treasurer of Duke Francis of Lorraine, soon surpassed them. \nDuke Francis sought to marry Charles VI\u2019s daughter, Maria-Theresa, France feared Habsburg proximity. So, following the loss of<italic> War of the Polish Succession</italic>, Francis traded Lorraine to French King Louis XV\u2019s father-in-law Stanislaw Leszczy\u0144ski in exchange for Tuscany in 1736 and married the heiress. However, after Charles VI died in 1740, Bavaria challenged Maria-Theresa\u2019s claim to the German throne in the <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic>. Joining Bavaria, Prussia annexed Silesia, referring to Breslau as the \u2018Pearl in the Prussian Crown.\u2019\nMeanwhile, Christian bankers grew their networks. In 1729, Leendert-Pieter Neufville a linen merchant descended from Calvinists and Mennonites and related to the Coymans family like <italic>Pels</italic>, started <italic>Neufville</italic> bank in Amsterdam. Likewise, Swiss Huguenot merchants established trade links across Europe. As <italic>Gontard</italic> established in Frankfurt, <italic>Bagueret</italic> started in Warsaw by 1735, merchants like Ami Dumont and Fran\u00e7ois Leclerc conducted trade in Leipzig. In the <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic>, the British soon called on Johann Fries, the Huguenot son of a M\u00fchlhausen mayor, to supply the troops of Austrian, Dutch, British, and Hanoverian troops in the Netherlands and Belgium. Amidst the global war, Britain called upon her trans-national Jewish bankers. \nIn America, Jacob Franks of New York and his son David of Philadelphia served as contractor agents, supplying British forces in Jamaica in 1740. As his sister wed the American-born James Schuyler DeLancey of Huguenot and Dutch heritage, who was New York\u2019s Chief Justice and soon became Lieutenant-Governor, David Franks married Margaret Evans, the Christian daughter of Pennsylvania\u2019s land deed recorder and sheriff. Since his Hart aunt had died in 1736, another of David\u2019s uncles wed another of Moses Hart\u2019s daughters (a niece of the Chief Rabbi of Britain) in 1743. When France conquered Madras in 1746, Franks\u2019 nephew joined Mordecai Hamburger in loans to EIC.\nAgainst the occupiers in 1742, Primator of Bohemian rural Jews Wolf Popper safeguarded the treasury Austria. But as Maria-Theresa ceded most of Silesia, she declared herself Queen of Bohemia and expelled Jews from there in 1745, suspecting some had abetted Prussia. That year, Chief Rabbi of Hungary Bernhard Eskeles married Samson Wertheim\u2019s daughter and retired from Moravia to advocate for Jews. \nBecause Maria-Theresa banned Jews from her Court, Bavarian Court Jew Wolf Wertheim connected Court Jews in other countries to seek diplomatic intervention. As Jacob Frankel of F\u00fcrth gained support from the Bishop of Bamberg, Britain\u2019s Moses Hart and Aaron Franks convinced King George II to mobilize his ministers, Christian VI of Denmark wrote personally to the Empress, and representatives of Holland, Turkey\u2019s Sultan, the Chief Bishop of Madrid, and the Elector of Mainz appealed to the Vienna. \nDelaying until 1746, Vienna, Prague, Buda, and other cities expelled Jews, often using violence and plunder. As war ended two years later, Austria readmitted the Jews to restore public finances. Instead, the Empress Maria-Theresa extended her father\u2019s Free Port of Trieste with legislation specifically attracting Jews from 1746. David Luzzatto and Grassin Levi led the Morpurgo, Parente, Porto, Treves, and Stella families to incorporate with governing statutes and tax collection authority. \nWhile Austria collected the Jewish Trieste tax, Sephardi Diego Aguilar saw his Austrian tobacco monopoly from 1725 end before he abruptly left Vienna in 1749 due to Spanish extradition demands, finding refuge in London. In 1751, the central government, municipalities, and officials under the Empress supported Count Bl\u00fcmegen and Baron Neffzern in founding <italic>Moravian Loan Bank</italic> in Br\u00fcnn, the first joint-stock private bank in the Habsburg monarchy.\nThe <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic> ended soon after the Austro-French alliance cemented in 1747 with the marriage of the Crown Prince of France and the daughter of Empress Maria-Theresa\u2019s cousin and Saxon Elector Augustus III, who had married in 1719. Instead of Jews, Protestants banked Austria. After Mathias died in 1749, his widow, Barbe Nettine, took over as Belgium\u2019s dominant banker. Within a year, Empress Maria-Theresa summoned <italic>Fries </italic>to Vienna. Although Fries was Protestant in Catholic Vienna, <italic>Fries</italic> shifted Austrian finance from Jews. By 1752, <italic>Fries</italic> marketed a significant portion of the state\u2019s silver <italic>thalers</italic>. Prohibiting importation of foreign goods, the Empress promoted industrialization of Bohemia. Like her father, she sought to break tradition by promoting Austrian Catholic nobility to invest in industry.\nInstead of relying on public debt, Britain financed the war by borrowing from BOE, SSC, and EIC. While <italic>Smyth</italic> subscribed to these issues cautiously, John Smyth served as a director of both SSC and EIC around this time. To participate in this market, West Indies-born Sephardi Samson Gideon married a British Christian in 1745 to secure his position in British society and financial markets. \nAround the same time, Charles Edward Stuart, grandson of the deposed King James II, gained support from French forces and Jacobite Scottish bankers like <italic>Drummond</italic>. He landed in Scotland in mid-1745, launching the Jacobite Rebellion. After an initial success, Stuart advanced as far as Derby before retreating to Scotland. He was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746, which resulted in panic in London and a run from BOE notes in the <italic>Panic of 1745</italic>.\nIn response, <italic>Mocatta</italic>, Gideon, and Dutch financier Theodore Janssen and British banker John Barnard, worked to stabilize the British credit system by securing Dutch and German capital. Surpassing Continental Court Jews in wealth and influence, providing \u00a31 million to a loan and proposing a subscription for circulating BOE notes in 1747, as Theodore Janssen\u2019s Christian cousin-in-law married Gideon-allied DaCosta Villareal cousin of the Suassos. \nSimilarly, having linked London\u2019s Dutch and Huguenot communities since marrying the widow of Huguenot financier, Dutch Protestant Gerard Neck banked the East Indies trade until his death in 1750. That year, Gerard\u2019s brother Joshua took over the banking house and refocused on <italic>Exchequer</italic> debt. As his daughter married Thomas Walpole, a nephew of Robert Walpole, Britain\u2019s first PM, Joshua earned a knighthood in 1751.  \nSince marrying a Christian in 1745, Gideon had his children baptized and continued to manage British loans through the ongoing wars. In 1757, his daughter married politician Viscount William Gage. However, King George II denied Gideon\u2019s request for a peerage due to his Jewish background. Instead, in 1759, Gideon\u2019s thirteen-year-old son was made a baronet, allowing the family to join the British aristocracy.\nSimilarly, mixed religion firms linked merchants and nobles within France and to Europe. Descended from Sephardi refugees of the Portuguese Inquisition, Jean-Baptiste Silva was born in Bordeaux, and pursued a medical career like his father but converted to Catholicism. Becoming attached to the court, he wed a daughter of the <italic>P</italic><italic>rocureur au Ch\u00e2telet</italic><italic> </italic>in 1710. Their daughter later wed the main financier in Limoges. Silva\u2019s brother Gabriel Silva used the royal court connections for his bank, <italic>Silva</italic>. Originally relying on family in Tonneins and Bayonne, <italic>Silva</italic>\u2019s Christian correspondents included <italic>Pels</italic> in Amsterdam and, in Paris, <italic>Heusch</italic>\u2014a Huguenot who converted to Catholicism\u2014and then the Huguenot <italic>Chabbert</italic>, which became <italic>Mallet</italic>. <italic>Silva</italic> later retained cousin <italic>Mendes </italic><italic>D</italic><italic>aCosta</italic> in London and fellow Sephardi <italic>Pereire</italic> in La Rochelle.\nMeanwhile, British and Russian forces attempted to gain control of regions in South America, particularly Brazil around 1737. However, due to opposition, conflicts, and lack of support, these plans ultimately failed, leaving Spain\u2019s Indies empire intact. With the end of the <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic>, Britain lost the slave trade <italic>asiento</italic>, but contra banding made the privilege less of a bargaining chip. \nThe Dutch, allies of the British and Habsburgs, centralized control over their colonies with the aid of Amsterdam-born Isa\u00e4c Pinto. Since marrying the daughter of the wealthy Benjamin Nunes Henriques and becoming a Parnas, Pinto assisted the Dutch treasury by advancing funds at low rates during the war with France from 1748. With his efforts, Stadtholder William IV was appointed Governor of VOC in 1748 and, the following year, Governor of GWC. Likewise, Pinto became a VOC shareholder and, in 1750, was appointed to her board alongside Emanuel Lopes Suasso. While Pinto promoted emigration to Suriname and Cura\u00e7ao as a solution for the economic difficulties faced by Dutch Jews, few did. \nConnected with the Pintos, <italic>Gradis</italic> of Bordeaux expanded in French Canada. During the 1740s, the family shipped war supplies to Canada, incurring costs that were partially reimbursed after the war. In 1748, Abraham Gradis founded <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Canada</italic> to promote trade between France and her Canadian territories. Although laws continued to restrict Jewish land ownership in the Caribbean, Gradis was soon granted permission. \nAs Catholic Frenchman Antoine Crozat helped form a new <italic>Angola Co</italic> monopoly in 1748 and challenged the old <italic>Senegal Co</italic>, Nantes investors to organize <italic>Guinea Co</italic>. By 1750, both <italic>Guinea</italic> and <italic>Angola</italic> reached a compromise, as Crozat\u2019s granddaughter married Etienne Choiseul, the son of a chamberlain of Empress Maria-Theresa\u2019s husband. By then Britain and EIC reclaimed Madras from France with the aid of David Franks\u2019 nephew and Mordecai Hamburger. Since Franks\u2019 uncle wed Moses Hart\u2019s daughter (a niece of the Chief Rabbi of Britain) in 1743, Moses Hart\u2019s cousin-in-law married Dutch merchant David Prager in 1750. As Prager\u2019s brother branched to London, he expanded into the East Indies diamond trade.\nUnlike Jews, Protestants were ingratiated into commerce as aldermen with less need to fund risky political wars. Since Catholic Cologne expelled Jews and Protestants, the Catholic Meinertzhagen family ruled Cologne for centuries. While Gerhard Meinertzhagen was honored with the title of \u2018Eeichsritter\u2019 by Habsburg Emperor Francis I, Abraham held various esteemed positions under Emperor Charles VII, Isaac served as Canonicus at Cologne, and a daughter wed a Count. While his Catholic cousins inherited large copper mines near Cologne, Daniel, whose mother descended from Emperor Charlemagne, migrated to Protestant Bremen by the late 17th century, where he started <italic>Meinertzhagen</italic> and became a senator. His descendants continued this tradition for generations.\nSimilarly, Lutheran Joachim Kleinwort secured a royal license, operated a brewery in Altona by 1700, and expanded into a distillery. Around 1713, Johann Baring and Anthon Schr\u00f6der apprenticed textile in Bremen. However, their journeys diverged. In 1717, Johann and his Lutheran pastor father left for Britain, where he apprenticed for a wool merchant. He eventually married the merchant\u2019s daughter in Exeter. Meanwhile, Anthon Schr\u00f6der moved to Lower Saxony, where he wed a merchant\u2019s daughter and founded a trading firm in 1730. Upon John Baring\u2019s death in 1743, his son Francis took over. After a bad harvest, Francis started <italic>Baring</italic> to expand to commodities and discount commercial paper (\u201cCP\u201d). \nFrom a line of Lutheran pastors around Saxony and Bohemia, Benjamin Metzler moved to Frankfurt in 1671. Since the <italic>Thirty Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, Frankfurt\u2019s population was mostly comprised of immigrants, with only a small indigenous population. Non-Lutheran denominations, such as Reformed, Catholic, or Jewish, had limited civil rights and political representation in the city during that time. After marrying the daughter of a deceased converted Weil cloth merchant in 1674, Metzler founded his own cloth business, which he transformed into <italic>Metzler</italic> private bank from 1744. Throughout the 18th century, the city\u2019s population slowly increased, and Frankfurt\u2019s social structure was dominated by the patriciate, an independent group of urban bourgeoisies involved in real estate and military positions.\nSince Frankfurt\u2019s Jewish ghetto was restricted in size and had few rights, marriages had to connect across Europe. In 1681, Jakob Glogau, a linen and lace merchant from Silesia, immigrated to Frankfurt. By 1712, his son Marx wed Merle Schiff Wertheim\u2019s extended cousin. In Holland, Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s second grandnephew Tobias Boas followed his father as a jeweler in the Hague. Born to a Rabbi in Posen, Tobias\u2019 second grandaunt married Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s son, becoming Glikl\u2019s sister-in-law. \nSince Tobias\u2019 mother died soon after the family moved to the Hague, his father married Benedict Gomperz\u2019s cousin-once-removed. While Tobias wed Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s second great niece, another second cousin married a Cohen-Barent (and gave birth to Levi Cohen-Barent) in Amsterdam. By 1741, Tobias managed claims for the creditors of the King of Prussia\u2019s government councilor.  Several of Boas\u2019 children kinterlinked with Samuel Symons of Amsterdam and one wed Samson Wertheim\u2019s Kann grandson, from a Frankfurt family serving in banking and religious roles in Frankfurt since the 16th century.  While active only in Frankfurt, the Kanns branched to the Hague around 1760, forming what became <italic>Lissa Kann</italic>. \nFor connected Jews, Frankfurt offered respite on the one hand. When Saxon G\u00f6ttingen expelled her Jews in 1750, Aaron Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen fled to Frankfurt to serve as a rabbi assessor. On the other hand, the crowded ghetto was dangerous. After a smallpox epidemic in the Frankfurt ghetto orphaned Mayer Rothschild in 1755, he apprenticed with a relative, the Hanover Court Jew, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s grandson Wolf Oppenheim. Learning the collectibles trade during this time, Rothschild began selling coins to Prince Wilhelm of Hesse.\nUnlike G\u00f6ttingen, Prussian King Frederick II eased barriers on <italic>Court & Protected Jew Act of 1750</italic> to promote Prussian industry, like his father did before him. Frederick\u2019s father, King William I, had hired Daniel Jaffe of Poland, a descendant of Rabbi Jaffe, to supply army horses with the right to live in Berlin around 1714. After his son was born in 1722 in Berlin\u2014before adopting the name Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2014he became a Protected Jew in 1727. From 1736, Prussia banned foreign silk imports, forcing Court Jews to reinvest minting profits into local industry. \nAs King William demanded more silver from 1733, Gomperz, Frankel, and Ephraim families competed fiercely, as they did elsewhere in Germany. Third cousins with Gomperz from F\u00fcrth, two Frankels\u2014second great-nephews of Koppel Frankel and Joseph Goldschmidt\u2014mined, one sister married the Katz-descendant Rabbi Teomin of Breslau and Wilna, and another sister wed her third cousin Veitel Ephraim of Hamburg (whose grandmother was Frankel). By 1742, the Ephraims surpassed competitors. \nBetween Poland and Prussia, Leipzig funneled silver from Polish Lords through bustling fairs in Oder and Breslau to Berlin and Frankfurt. Since the Wulff family was interlinked with the F\u00fcrsts of Hamburg, Jeremias F\u00fcrst\u2019s son-in-law Gerd Levis gained the favor of Elector of Saxony, becoming Mint Jew of Saxony in 1710 and gaining the rare privilege of residence in Leipzig. \nFor decades, Levis faced opposition from the merchants and nobility of the city council and Saxon Landtag, resulting in multiple expulsions, but each time he was reinstated by the Elector. After Levis\u2019 daughter married a Frankel in 1735, the Ephraims began coining in Leipzig in 1737. When Levis died in 1739, his son Levis Gerd succeeded him, facing opposition from merchants and goldsmiths, but the royal council upheld his position while restricting trade to fairs.\nBack in 1731, a Teomin Frankel of Berlin descended from Katz, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, Joseph Goldschmidt, and Lipman Cohen-Behrens, married Simon Bondi, who descended from the Kings of Judah and the delBanco family\u2014thus a cousin to the Warburgs\u2014of Prague. Following Empress Maria-Theresa\u2019s expulsion of the Jews of Prague in 1745, the Bondis fled to the Dresden with Salomon Duschenes. While he descended from the Brandeis brother-in-law of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe\u2019s daughter, Duschenes\u2019 cousin Lobl Duschenes, a descendant of Rabbi Lowe, had married Joachim Popper\u2019s sister. As  Duschenes obtained a permit to supply Dresden\u2019s mint with Bondi, the soon rivaled Gerd Levis.\nMeanwhile, the partners\u2019 brother, Katz-in-law Rabbi of Dessau David Frankel, taught his cousin, Katz-descendant Moses Mendelssohn. Born in Dessau in 1729, the short and misshapen Mendelssohn was a prodigy. After David Frankel became Rabbi of Berlin in 1742, a Berlin silk merchant hired Mendelssohn as a tutor and partner 1750. Over this time, Mendelssohn proselytized non-Torah law acceptance to modernize. As one of the Ephraim partners died in 1748 and Frankel left minting, Marianne, third granddaughter of Joseph Goldschmidt, and a descendant of Katz Wulff Court Jews banished from Berlin to Dessau by the Liebmans, married Daniel Itzig-Jaffe. \nWhile the war forced Oppenheim and Schiff-in-law Mozes Gomperz to flee creditors in 1750 to Amsterdam, his nephew\u2014an in-law of Ephraim\u2014remained in Prussia. After the <italic>Court & Protected Jew Act of 1750</italic>, Prussia\u2019s coin contract expired in 1751. So, King Frederick hired Itzig-Jaffe and Ephraim in-laws to supply the stables and act as Breslau\u2019s Mint Jews to connect to Dutch credit. However, relationships with his Gomperz-in-laws resulted in lawsuits and split families in 1755. By then, King Frederick expanded ironworks and mining of Silesia\u2019s coal with reduced taxation and welfare benefits to attract skilled workers.\nHolding Austria\u2019s tobacco monopoly from 1725, Sephardi Diego Aguilar met Empress Maria-Theresa. Her prejudice was so intense that she communicated with him from behind a screen rather than meeting him face-to-face. After Aguilar\u2019s monopoly ended in 1747, he abruptly left Vienna in 1749 due to Spanish extradition demands, finding refuge in London. In 1751, the central government, municipalities, and officials under the Empress supported Count Bl\u00fcmegen and Baron Neffzern in founding <italic>Moravian Loan Bank</italic> in Br\u00fcnn, the first joint-stock private bank in the Habsburg monarchy.\nIn Austrian Bohemia, meanwhile, Israel Popper H\u00f6nig, a Sephardi grandson of Wolf Popper, the Primator of Bohemian rural Jews, innovated a tobacco dying process that German traders had kept secret. Having become wealthy during the <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic>, H\u00f6nig earned the right to lease the tobacco monopoly in Prague for ten years from 1752. \nBy 1754, the Empress allowed limited Jewish return to Prague. As Prague invited Katz-descendant Rabbi Ezekiel Landau of Opatow from Yampol to be their Rabbi. The Bohemian Jews also financed Austria\u2019s ally, Saxony, out of Dresden. Since Simon Bondi began supplying silver to the Mint independently, he established <italic>Bondi</italic> in 1755 to focus on FX. While his former manager and Popper\u2019s cousin-in-law Salomon Duschenes died, Duschenes\u2019 widow continued the business as her son became the Mint Jew.\nLikewise, Jews gained some rights in the Italian peninsula. Austrian Sardinia allowed Jewish textile manufacturers to open establishments outside the Ghettos while not residing there. Like in Venice, the Jewish badge fell into disuse, Sardinian Nice abolished the obligation to wear the badge in 1750. In 1752, Genoa readmitted the Jews without imposing the Ghetto system., and in 1767 the Jewish loan-banks were suppressed on the foundation of a nonprofit <italic>Monte di Pieta</italic>. While Genoa bank<italic> Sacerdote</italic> remained among the most powerful private banks in Sardinian Turin, the Avigdor family, having settled in Nice in the early 17th century, founded a bank in 1768.\nWith the rise of Prussia following the <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic>, European alliances shifted. It began with Britain disrupting existing alliances by concluding a subsidy treaty with Russia in 1755. In response, Frederick II of Prussia signed a treaty with Britain in early 1756, attempting to neutralize Germany. This treaty infuriated France, leading to a treaty between France and Austria months later. Following this, Frederick invaded Saxony in late 1756, initiating the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>. Amidst the Prussian siege of Prague in 1757, Rabbi of Prague Ezekiel Landau resisted appeals to flee and, instead, called on Jews to defend Austria. Likewise, Israel Popper H\u00f6nig and his uncle Joachim Popper, son of the Primator of Bohemian rural Jews, supplied Austria\u2019s army.\nWhile Christian merchants and nobles of Saxon fought Jewish monopoly of mints, Christian Johann G\u00f6dieke of Hanover, a former Ansbach mint official leased the Leipzig mint for a year in 1752\u00a0before passing to merchant banker Christian Frege, the son of a Protestant minister from a Saxon village. Frege expanded into the Polish market against the Frankels. During the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War</italic>, the Prussian King Frederick seized the mint and transferred control to Prussian Jewish financiers. After resisting but ultimately losing control, Frege fled and became a war contractor supplying Prussia\u2019s enemies.\nIn 1755, the King of Prussia Frederick began transferring control of the mints in Konigsberg, Breslau, Berlin, Magdeburg, Cleve, and Aurich to private enterprise, spurring competing Mint Jews alliances. A faction led by Frankel and Ephraim vied with the group of Gompertz and Itzig-Jaffe. As an early wartime measure, the Prussian state assumed control of the Leipzig mint, where Ephraim began coining alongside Saxon Court Jew Levis Gerd, his in-law through the Frankels, in January 1757. Following the Battle of Kolin\u2014which destabilized Prussian forces in Saxony\u2014Ephraim fled Leipzig.\nAlong with Berlin, <italic>Ephraim </italic>branched to Amsterdam. After joining that bank as a bookkeeper in 1755, Naphtali Wessely became a manager. Born in Hamburg, Wessely was a grandson of Issachar Rindskopf of Frankfurt and a cousin of the Oppenheim family. In 1760, he established a bank in Copenhagen. Around then, his Rindskopf cousins of Frankfurt\u2014Simon and Beer Nehm Rindskopf\u2014founded <italic>Rindskopf</italic> bank that quickly gained prominence through partnerships with <italic>Frankel </italic>of F\u00fcrth, <italic>Wertheim</italic> in Vienna, <italic>Halle</italic> in Hamburg, <italic>Gomperz</italic> and <italic>Mendes</italic> in Amsterdam, and the Symons and Glogau families.\nAmidst the war, Prussia\u2019s <italic>Court & Protected Jew Act of 1750</italic> and Silesian development fostered German collaborations with neutral Amsterdam and Poland, under the rule of Saxon King Augustus III. In 1758, <italic>Boas</italic> nephew-in-law Simon Symons of Amsterdam married a daughter of Silesian linen merchant Marx Glogau of Oder. Likewise, Samuel Zbytkower, born near Silesian Czestochowa, moved from Oder to Praga outside of Warsaw by 1757, where he married heiresses from Poland and then Breslau. He initially traded thread, ribbons, and yard goods, later expanding into cattle, grain, and other commodities and becoming Warsaw\u2019s only merchant to serve as the King\u2019s Commissaire in 1766. \nThe Catholic Habsburgs of Austrian depended on Vienna\u2019s Huguenot Court Banker Fries during the <italic>Seven Years War</italic>, who managed French subsidies and loans totaling amounts unknown since Samuel Oppenheim, soon taking charge of commercializing state mines. <italic>Fries</italic>\u2019 dominance in government finance was attributed to strong foreign connections, particularly with bank houses in the Austrian Netherlands, Dutch, and Italian correspondents. His relationship with the banking house of <italic>Widow</italic> <italic>Nettine</italic> of Brussels played a crucial role in Austrian foreign borrowing from 1756. \nAround 1757, Nettine\u2019s eldest daughter married General Receiver Adrien Walckiers, who was then promoted to Councilor of State and Robe and Grand Bailiff of Termonde. Although both were \u2018working\u2019 overtime during this inflationary period, Barbe Nettine maintained her near monopoly of Belgian lotteries and coin mints by thwarting plans for a public note-issuing Belgian bank. \nMeanwhile, Nettine saw the rise of another female dealmaker, Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson. Following the <italic>War for the Spanish Succession</italic> in 1715, Poisson\u2019s father Francois bought the office of Secretary to the King, becoming a first degree noble. His marriage in 1718 to the daughter of the meat supplier to the Parisian H\u00f4tel des Invalides in Paris was witnessed by the P\u00e2ris brothers, prominent financiers, and Claude Blanc, Minister of War under the Regency of Philippe d\u2019Orleans. In 1727, he left France for an extended period in Germany, during which General Receiver Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Normant took on a protective role for his family. While Normant arranged Jeanne-Antoinette to marry his nephew in 1741, she became King Louis XV\u2019s mistress in 1745 with Normant\u2019s encouragement.\nMore than a financial instrument, Poisson herself became actively involved in domestic and international finance. Along with dealing behind the scenes, she was a patron of Pierre DuPont, whose essay on landed capitalism she financed. Born to Anne Monchanin, of a formerly wealthy French family impoverished by their commitment to the Huguenot faith, and Samuel DuPont, a Rouen watchmaker and one of eleven children from a modest home, DuPont later became involved in French finances. She also favored Etienne Choiseul. Since marrying French banker Crozat\u2019s granddaughter in 1750, Choiseul, the son of a chamberlain of Empress Maria-Theresa\u2019s husband, became Ambassador to Rome by 1753.\nAs Court Banker, Jean-Paris Montmartel retired, France contracted Jean-Joseph Laborde to supply and finance the military. A Bayonne General Receiver and son of the Marine Treasurer, Laborde was born in Jaca, Spain, to a daughter of the noble d\u2019Aleman family of B\u00e9arn. The Labordes had extensive connections, particularly in Canada and Spain. In the French colonial fortress of Louisbourg, on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Laborde\u2019s sisters married the Keeper of the Royal Warehouses in 1750 and a schooner owner. \nLaborde also lent money to various agencies, including <italic>Beaujon Goossens</italic>, to support military and governmental operations during the period. Since the 1740s, the Huguenot Beaujon family linked France with her Canadian colony. In the 1680s, two Beaujon brothers owned vineyards in Bordeaux. After Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, one brother converted to Catholicism to avoid land confiscation, while the other moved to Holland. Born in 1708, Jean, the Catholic brother\u2019s grandson, married a daughter of Louis XV\u2019s chamberlain.\nHaving expanded into the grain trade and the family\u2019s wealth, Jean Beaujon left his estate to his son Nicolas after his death in 1745. Moving to Paris by 1751, Nicolas invested heavily in shipping. In 1756, Nicolas became the La Rochelle Receiver General of Finance, managing naval finances. He partnered with the Dutch Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Goossens, a Dutchman naturalized as French in Bilbao, to supply the French navy. In 1758, they formed <italic>Beaujon</italic> <italic>Goossens</italic>, securing Dutch loans for naval frigates and managing Dutch investments in French debt and tax farms during the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>. Along with naval operations, <italic>Beaujon Goossens</italic> financed <italic>Gradis</italic>\u2019 services. Sephardi <italic>Gradis</italic> of Bordeaux advanced large sums to the royal administration and supplied French forces in Canada, securing state contracts for military garrisons. The firm also sent 17 shiploads of supplies to the colonies during a famine.\nWhile Choiseul became ambassador to the Habsburg court in Vienna from 1757, Laborde soon became Collector General and purchased paper rescriptions for money advanced in the royal service. However, the <italic>Panic of 1759</italic> struck late in the year, particularly affecting Laborde. <italic>Beaujon Goossens</italic> encountered issues when their funds from Holland and London fell short. In October 1759, payments on bills of exchange from French colonies like Quebec were suspended, worsening the financial situation. \n<italic>Beaujon Goossens</italic> declared bankruptcy in November, causing disruptions across European banking networks, including <italic>Pels</italic> in Amsterdam and <italic>Hope</italic> in London. While <italic>Gradis</italic> managed to survive through the war despite ship losses and the delay in payments until 1762, <italic>Pinto</italic> in Amsterdam went bankrupt during the financial strain in 1761. As Avignon expelled Jews in 1762, Isa\u00e4c Pinto petitioned Duke Louis Richelieu to secure privileges for Sephardi.  \nLaborde soon replaced Choiseul as Court Banker, and so managed payments to diplomats and subsidies to allies. To cement the alliance between King Louis XV and Empress Maria-Theresa for France to subsidize Austria, Court Banker Laborde and the Montmartel, Nettine, and Choiseul families kinterlinkwed. Although her daughter Marie-Antoinette was still in the cradle, the Empress promised her in marriage to the French Crown Prince. \nIn April 1760, Laborde married Barbe Nettine\u2019s daughter. In early 1762, another daughter wed Joseph Harvelay, Keeper of the Royal Treasury and Jean-Paris Montmartel\u2019s great-nephew and successor. By July, a third daughter married Ange-Laurent Jully, Introducer of Ambassadors and Poisson\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Also in 1762, the Empress chartered Austria\u2019s first public note issuing bank in Vienna based on Venice\u2019s <italic>Giro Bank</italic>. After the death of Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson in 1764, Choisul was forced to retire by his enemies.\nAs Austria and France solidified their military alliance from 1757, Russia joined shortly after. Despite several tactical victories, Frederick faced mounting pressure. By February 1759, <italic>Ephraim</italic> allied with Itzig-Jaffe to lease the Prussian mints as well as those in Leipzig and Dresden. From August, Prussia suffered more defeats, with King Frederick having to flee Berlin and, the following month, Austrian forces occupied Dresden. \nSince Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s niece Sprinz married Salomon Levy of Posen, Sprinz\u2019s sister married a son of one of the Goldschmidt-descended Frankels who had left mining in 1761. That year, Levy received a Berlin settlement permit from Frederick to mint coins. After Ephraim and Itzig-Jaffe concluded contracts in 1762, Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s nephew married a F\u00fcrst, connecting to the Saxon Court Jews. The same year, the Austrian Habsburgs finally settled debts to the Oppenheim family, and Moses Mendelssohn married Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s great-granddaughter, Fromet Guggenheim, and became a Protected Jew of Berlin. As Fromet\u2019s sisters wed Leon Hirschel and Moses F\u00fcrst, Moses\u2019 network in-law network expanded, and gained acclaim on his philosophy of morality.\nSince resources and credit grew scarce during the war, the mints decreased quality and local hoarding of high-quality coins led to inflation. Growing coin exchange and credit stimulated bankers. Johann Gotzkowsky, an orphaned son of a minor noble from the Polish Danzig area, apprenticed at a Berlin merchant house before establishing a silk and porcelain business and becoming a merchant to Frederick. While Frederick bailed out Gotzkowsky several times, Gotzkowsky later intervened when Russian forces occupied Berlin and took Itzig-Jaffe hostage, successfully reducing the ransom. But while Prussian law required him to accept devalued currency, Dutch creditors demanded payment in sound coin. Still, Itzig-Jaffe and Ephraim confiscated Gotzkowsky\u2019s coinage imported in violation of exchange regulations. \nFrom 1761, Gotzkowsky worked with co-religionist <italic>Splitgerber Daum</italic>. After Daum died in 1743, David Splitgerber took control and brought in Johan Schickler of Alsace, who married his daughter and became a partner. Along with owning ships, the firm traded goods such as tropical products, grain, timber, pig-iron, linen, and copper, and dealt in bills of exchange, coins, and British annuities. King Frederick consulted Splitgerber on commercial matters, and the firm supplied arms and munitions from the <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic>.\nIn the American theater of the war, David Franks\u2019 sister-in-law married the fellow-widowed nephew of David Barclay, head of <italic>Barclay</italic> London, and extended credit to <italic>Willing</italic> of Philadelphia. As the war reached a stalemate, French attempt to involve Spain resulting in heavy losses. However, the death of Tsarina Elizabeth in 1762 saved Frederick, leading to a shift in alliances under her nephew Peter. Peace negotiations began with Europe\u2019s terms restoring the pre-war status quo.\nHowever, Itzig-Jaffe out of Prussia was perhaps the wealthiest man in Europe. But like other Court Jews, he had limited free agency. Under pressure from Frederick to invest his profits into Prussian manufacturing, he purchased iron works in the Harz Mountains. But the general post-war deflation also set off a crisis among international traders of bills of exchange. After the small Jewish trader Arend\u00a0Joseph allegedly absconded Amsterdam in January 1763 to the sanctuary city of Culemborg, unsubstantiated antisemitic rumors blamed him for starting a panic, although sanctuary cities accepted only debtors, not thieves, homosexuals, or others judged to be criminal.\nWhen illiquidity drove the larger Christian <italic>Neufville </italic>of Amsterdam into insolvency, <italic>Hope</italic> and other creditors supported a composition, but a holdout by <italic>Pels</italic> forced bankruptcy on July 25. On August 4, a group of Jewish merchants of Hamburg and Amsterdam petitioned Amsterdam for bankruptcy preference. Two days later, the bank money premium collapsed as 17 Amsterdam houses ceased payments. \nThe <italic>Panic of 1763</italic> erupted after a group of Hamburg creditors threatened to shut down trading on Amsterdam unless they were granted preferences. Although <italic>Neufville </italic>eventually paid out over 60% in 36 years, the Hamburg banks could not stand a protracted bankruptcy process. Where endorsement formerly offered security, now Hamburg banks were asked to pay twice for the same bill\u2014once to failed Amsterdam bankers, and once to the bill owner\u2014distressing selling to meet obligations from the accommodation bills. \nIn Prussia, Gotzkowsky and other Berlin firms warned King Frederick that local manufacturers might fail if the panic spread to Prussia and asked for a moratorium. While Frederick refused a general moratorium, he requested Itzig-Jaffe grant credit to Gotzkowsky on August 10th. Arguing that Gotzkowsky was insolvent, Itzig-Jaffe refused. Nor did <italic>Splitgerber Daum</italic> aid him. As Frederick\u2019s loan proposal failed, the situation worsened. \nOn August 13th, the Berlin City Council reported Gotzkowsky's inability to redeem bills of exchange and suggested an emergency fund. Despite the request, King Frederick established a targeted moratorium for Gotzkowsky and a special bankruptcy court. By 1764, Frederick shuttered the mints and began a deflationary program to improve coin quality.\nAustro-French bankers, meanwhile, consolidated. While in Paris in 1764, Johann Fries married Anne Escherny, the daughter of a notable Neuch\u00e1tel burgess who also served as consul in Lyons for the King of Poland. Fries\u2019 influence grew notably after 1763 when he began overseeing most of Poland\u2019s external loans. By 1766, Fries brought fellow Huguenot Johann Gontard of Frankfurt\u2019s <italic>Gontard</italic> into <italic>Fries</italic>. \nSo did the Court Jews. During the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, Israel Popper H\u00f6nig supplied the Austrian army, leading Maria-Theresa to grant him privileges to settle in Bohemian Jewish communities, engage in trade, and secure the tobacco monopoly leases for various regions. Since the Empress expelled Jews and formed the Habsburg Empire\u2019s first joint-stock private bank <italic>Moravian Loan Bank</italic> in 1751, shareholders dismissed the first director for neglecting lending in 1765, and transferred control of the bank to the Jewish tobacco monopoly, likely under government pressure. \nThat year, the Empress allowed H\u00f6nig to create the first decade-long Jewish tobacco tax farming syndicate including H\u00f6nig\u2019s uncle Joachim Popper (the son of the Primator of Bohemian rural Jews), a Gunzburg cousin Primator of Prague, and the K\u00f6nigswarters of Bohemia, who kinterlinked with two Oppenheim Hirschels and the son of the Primator of Prague, who descended from Koppel Frankel. In 1767, H\u00f6nig\u2019s sister married a Frankel descendant two years later. \nFor supplying the Mint of the Elector of Saxony during through the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, Simon Bondi became Saxon Court Jew in 1765, and his nephew married Joachim Popper\u2019s niece, the daughter of L\u00f6bl Duschenes, a decade later. Bohemia also forged ties with Austria\u2019s Port Jews. Since incorporating Trieste\u2019s Jewish tax in the 1740s, Menasse Morpurgo, Grassin Levi and his cousin Gioachimo Vivante Hierschel, Isacco Alpron, and the Luzzattos incorporated Trieste\u2019s first insurer in 1764. From 1775, the Hierschels boosted exports of Bohemian textile through Trieste, where Marco Levi established a monopoly on tobacco sales, and Morpurgo grew the insurer. \nChartering Prussia\u2019s <italic>Royal Bank</italic> to monetize plantations for his knights, the Junkers, in June 1765, Frederick monopolized credit by requiring all payments be made via <italic>Royal Bank</italic> and channeled all trusts and public funds therein. By August, the run from coins and domestic credit forced to institute a general three-year moratorium. As <italic>Royal Bank</italic> bailed out insiders, she suspended payouts by October. Like Gotzkowsky had to liquidate his silk factories that year, many bankers who had averted bankruptcy in 1763, collapsed by 1766. \nPrivate credit further disappeared after Frederick threatened Jews against charging usurious interest. As Gotzkowsky filed for bankruptcy, Daniel Itzig-Jaffe found it difficult to fuel his Harz iron forges and sold them to the Prussian government by 1767 and took over a government owned leather plant. Also from that year, Salomon Levy joined his uncle-in-law Itzig-Jaffe to coin silver. While creditors foreclosed on estates as the moratorium ended in 1768, Prussia\u2019s economy began growing, and the special bankruptcy shuttered in 1769.\nLikewise, Court Jews connected central banks to their client states. Earlier, following Amsterdam, the independent Imperial city of Hamburg solved the problem of diverse coinage with the central <italic>Bank of Hamburg </italic>in 1619. Amidst chaos in Prussia, the Sephardi Marcus Beit of Hamburg obtained approval to establish a silver separating and melting furnace by 1770. Beit\u2019s precious metal works became important for Hamburg\u2019s economy as metal processing became vital for money changing and banking due to numerous coin types. Beit\u2019s strong ties with <italic>Bank of Hamburg </italic>gave them an advantage over competitors. \nParallelly, the Venetian delBanco family who led the organization of <italic>Giro Bank</italic> in 1619, became Protected Jews of the Prince-Bishop of Paderborn using the Warburg surname, and kintrlinked with a Henriques around 1767, likely extended cousin of the Sephardi Teixeiras of London and Amsterdam. Another Henriques kinterlinked with London Katz-descendants related to Hirschel Levin, Gunzburg, Frankel, and Yitzhak Teomin Frankel. Following the death of Aaron Hart in 1756, Hirschel Levin\u2014a cousin of the Goldschmidt Hamburgers through his ancestor Zevi Ashkenasy and a son of a Katz-descendant Chief Rabbi of Resha of Galicia, Glogau of Posen, and Amsterdam\u2014led the <italic>Great Synagogue</italic> with acceptance from<italic> Hambros </italic>as the Chief Rabbi of British Ashkenazi.\nSince colonizing the Philippines in 1570, Spanish authorities initially welcomed the Chinese immigrants for their skills, energy, and capital resources, recognizing their vital contributions to commerce. However, as the Chinese community grew in economic influence, the Spanish grew suspicious of their power. In 1581, the Spanish enforced segregation, confining the Chinese to a ghetto outside Manila with a strict curfew. Subsequent repression included deportation of 12,000 Chinese in 1596, the killing of 23,000 during the revolt of 1603, and another 23,000 during the revolt of 1639. In 1755, all non-Christian Chinese faced expulsion, prompting many to convert to avoid deportation. Further tension arose in 1764 when 6,000 Chinese were killed for supporting the English. Still, the Chinese remained integral to the economy of the Philippines. \nAs China limited foreign trade to designated \u2018security merchants\u2019 after 1745, the thirteen leading hong merchants in Canton evolved into merchant-bureaucrats in 1755. While the <italic>Puankhequa</italic> hong dynasty continued, there were only eight hongs by 1780 due to failures and fierce competition. Like merchant bankers, hongs extended credit (\u201c<italic>qianzhuang</italic>\u201d) to buyers. To ensure viable trading partners and prevent panics,<italic> Howqua</italic>\u2019s Wu Guoying joined the other merchant-bureaucrat aldermen to regulate trade and handle relations with foreigners. \n<italic>Puankhequa</italic>\u2019s one-time cashier, Wu Guoying traded since 1768. The Wu family long resided in the principal Fujian black tea district. Guoying\u2019s forefather from before China closed ports had been a hong merchant of the Port of Amoy. Guoying began trading with foreigners as <italic>Howqua</italic> out of Canton after 1777. Guoying\u2019s son Bingjian followed the tradition. Working with Thomas-Handasyd Perkins, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne,<italic> </italic>and other Anglo-American shippers, Bingjian became among the wealthiest men of his time.\nBack in the 1750s, Russian Tsarina Elizabeth turned over state-owned metal works and alcohol monopolies to the gentry, Elizabeth chartered <italic>Commercial Bank</italic> to fund enterprise and <italic>Noble Bank</italic> to monetize estates. While Russia could not access Dutch capital, the British <italic>Russia Co </italic>rushed in. John Cayley, an Anglican descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, joined <italic>Russia Co</italic> in 1754. Two years later, he wed a daughter of Richard Cozens\u2014Tsar Peter\u2019s shipbuilder\u2014related to the Raikes and Gomms. Through the Wrangham sisters, the Raikes were related to <italic>Russia Co</italic>\u2019s Wilberforce and Thornton cousins, who kinterlinked with <italic>Smyth</italic>  in 1756. \nFollowing the death of Tsarina Elizabeth in 1762, her nephew Peter III ascended the throne. By Peter\u2019s wife, Catherine II, was related to the Kings of Denmark-Norway and Sweden. As Catherine overthrew Peter in 1762, she helped her lover Stanislaw Poniatowski become the King of Poland. While Catherine dissolved some of Elizabeth\u2019s monopolies for revenue, she established a protectorate over Poland and sought to expand into Turkish Ukraine in 1768. \nAs she encouraged Greek and Slav rebellions in the Balkans and seized the coal-rich Donetsk, many Poles took up arms against her. To fund the two-fronted war effort, Tsarina Catherine II used foreign private Court Bankers to serve as bankers to the Court and commission agents for foreign trade, starting with British <italic>Russia Co</italic>\u2019s William Gomm in 1765. Quickly amassing debts, he was denied credit by <italic>Hope</italic> and other Amsterdam bankers in 1767, leading to his collapse. At that point, <italic>Friedrichs</italic> raised Russia\u2019s first foreign loan through Dutch <italic>DeSmeth</italic> and Genovese Marquis Maurucius. Likewise, Catherine organized note issuing banks in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg and borrowed from Scot merchant Robert Rutherford.\nWhile Dutch Christian bankers mostly exited the trade of bills of exchange and refocused on government loans after the <italic>Panic of 1763</italic>, Jewish money traders, excluded from the government loan market, continued to operate in the narrow-margin bills market. Since the failure of <italic>Pinto</italic> in 1761, <italic>Boas</italic> of the Hague and his nephew-in-law Simon Symons of Amsterdam were the sole exception. \nSince Symons married a daughter of Silesian linen merchant Marx Glogau of Oder and Frankfurt in 1758, his brother-in-law Levin Glogau married a daughter of Elias Nijmegen of Amsterdam\u2014a descendant of Michael Speyer, Elias\u2019 wife was a Goldsmid sister-in-law\u2014in 1763, and, after the death of his Glogau wife, Symons married another of Elias\u2019 daughters in 1765. That year, son Glogau and Symons became Court Jews of Polish King Stanislaw Poniatowski and <italic>Boas</italic> funded Prince William V of Orange in Amsterdam. By 1770, <italic>Boas</italic> represented the heirs of the aristocratic Dutch Navy Vice Admiral Fran\u00e7ois Aerssen in the sale of a third of colonial Surinam to Amsterdam. \nLikewise, Samuel Zbytkower became a supplier to the Polish royal court and Polish army with his brother. Since becoming a Commissaire of Warsaw in 1766, Zbytkower gained that honor from Prussian King Frederick in 1771. In 1773, he was appointed Elder of the Jews and expanded into sawmills, distilleries, and real estate. By 1775, Russia appointed him as General Purveyor for her troops in Poland. As Poland appointed Zbytkower the Court Commissaire in 1776, his daughter married Karol Laski, of a family of Polish rabbis, who started <italic>Laski</italic> bank in Warsaw. \nAfter his failed marriages to heiresses from Poland and Breslau, Zbytkower married Judith Bucko, the daughter of an Oder communal elder. Her brother moved to Grodno around the same time and traded with the family. Possibly related to the Glogau family, Judith closely cooperated in business with Zbytkower, unlike his former wives. Around the same time, King Stanislaw established a fair in Radziwill\u2019s Berdichev. Before railroads, Berdichev was Eastern Europe\u2019s largest trade hub, with Jews trading iron, textiles, leather, flock, and wood goods. And so Berdichev became a key location for Russian army purveyors. \nWhile Central Europe increasingly allowed the inheritance of rabbinical posts, Western Europe largely upheld the prohibition. Indeed, Rabbi of Prague Ezekiel Landau supported the appointment of a rabbi\u2019s son to succeed his father, despite community opposition. While the disbanding of the Council of the Four Lands in 1764 diminished central authority over communal decisions, Polish nobles increasingly influenced rabbinical appointments. For example, since they were forbidden to settle in Bialystok, Jewish merchants developed Orla into a center of trade with cities like K\u00f6nigsberg, Wroclaw, and Bialystok.  \nHowever, Orla\u2019s Jewish community divided into factions led by Binyomin Kielmanowicz and Lejzer Hirszowicz. While Kielmanowicz secured a ten-year ban on Hirszowicz from the kahal in 1775, Hirszowicz secured the rabbinate for his son. The disputes reached Orla\u2019s owner Izabela Branicka\u2014sister of King Poniatowski and an in-law and extended cousin of the Radziwills\u2014who resolved the conflict with a law defining the roles of rabbis and kahal leaders.\nUnlike Constantinople other court factors, the Bazargan Basi provided the Janissaries with animals, weapons, food, and other goods on credit. Many of these posts were dangerous. While Bazargan David Zonana established strong connections with Janissary Commander Pasha Seyyid Hasan, he was executed after a rival faction replaced Seyyid in 1746. Within months, however, the new Pasha hired David\u2019s son, Jacob, to continue his legacy. The Zonana held the position until 1768, when their likely in-laws, Aciman, relieved them.\nAround Syrian Palestine, roaming Bedouins prevented farming and travel for centuries. In the 1720s, Bedouin Zaydans established control. As Dahir Omar became head of the family and leased tax and development rights. As he appointed his sons as rulers of sub-provinces, he waged multiple wars against Ottoman authorities and the ruler of Damascus, Suleyman Azm. When he sought to increase the population and approached the Jews, lowering taxes and supporting the resettlement of Tiberias. Haim Farhi and other Sephardi moved to Damascus to vend via their Gubbay in-laws in Constantinople. Still, Jews would later remember Dahir and his sons as cruel tyrants. (Of Davidic descent, the Gubbay family\u2014which translates to treasurer\u2014served for generations as Baghdad\u2019s Nasi.) \nIn 1737, Suleyman Azm tried to capture Tiberias from Dahir Omar but failed and was deposed. Reappointed in 1741, he renewed his efforts. In 1742, Suleyman\u2019s Jewish bankers, Farhi and Joseph Lutzati, warned Chief Rabbi of Tiberias Haim Abulafia of another siege, but Abulafia decided to stay. The siege ended when Suleyman was ordered to manage the Mecca pilgrim caravans. In 1743, Suleyman besieged Tiberias again. Abulafia wrote to Constantinople officials in support of Dahir, prompting many Jews to flee, but he remained. The siege ended with Suleyman\u2019s death. From 1750, Turkish Court Jews, Armenians, and other factors shifted from being purveyors of commodities to bankers. Armenians also monopolized the banking of Constantinople, and therefore the financing of provincial governors and tax collection. The last Jewish banker of a Grand Vizier was Jesova Soncino in 1747 and the last Greek banker was Scanavi Capsaloni in 1771.\nMeanwhile, Austrian merchants complained that Turk Balkan traders brought in \u2018bad\u2019 or no money while exporting gold. The low demand for Austrian goods in the Balkans led Austria to restrict remittances and promote native traders. Starting as muleteers where the Danube and Sava rivers met in Belgrade, ambitious merchants became forwarders, import-exporters, or moneylenders. Successful forwarding agents and merchants from these towns often progressed to Vienna. The Darvar family established their business near Belgrade around 1750, accumulating wealth, and shifted to banking in Vienna by the 1770s. The number of Turk merchants in Vienna multiplied. Likewise, the Armenian Greek Orthodox Sina moved from to Sarajevo in 1750, but as Pasha Ali and other Albanians looted his hometown in 1769, left for Vienna. \nRussian expansion into the Balkans unnerved Austrian Empress Maria-Theresa. As contracted in the Court Banker marriage treaty with France during the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, the Empress wed her daughter Marie-Antoinette to the French Crown prince (the future Louis XVI, and Prussia\u2019s King Frederick refocused Russian attention to Poland. So, Austria, Prussia, and Russia partitioned Polish Galicia, Danzig, and Latvia-Belarus in 1772, cleaving off a third of Poland\u2019s land and half of her population. \nVictorious over Turkey with funding from Dutch <italic>DeSmeth</italic> and Genoa\u2019s Marquis Maurucius in 1773, Russia\u2019s Catherine II elevated <italic>DeSmeth</italic> and Robert Rutherford to barons. Along with forcing the Sultan to promise to protect Orthodox worshippers, Catherine received a large indemnity, which she used to partially repay her loans. While Austria received Turkish Bukovina, which she later fused into Galicia, Russia turned to trade, colonizing Donetsk by promoting German, Bulgarian, and Greek immigration. \nWhile <italic>Noble</italic><italic> Bank</italic> financed Russian colonialism, Russia also turned to her new Jewry. At the time, Jews in Polish Belarus experienced lenient conditions. While constituting approximately 10% of the population in Podole, Volhynia, and Minsk, most resided in villages and small towns. With a prominent presence in leasing alcoholic beverage businesses from local gentry, Jews accounted for 54% of the merchant estate. After centuries of relying on the protection of the Polish crown, they encountered challenges from the declining influence of the crown and local nobility, clergy, and bourgeoisie. Nonetheless, they maintained self-government through legal pluralism via the kahal, which oversaw administrative, judiciary, and fiscal matters.\nInterested mainly in profits, Catherine II granted limited autonomy to Belarussian Jews. This included the right to collect and manage their own tax collection, but they remained subject to Polish legal jurisdiction, continuing to lack citizenship, and restricted from travel or urban business. Two Belarussian provinces did receive discrete rights for operating in cities. Meanwhile, Prussia granted Salomon Levy and his family general protection privileges to conduct business in 1774, Itzig-Jaffe joined with cousin Levy to import silver coinage with Vienna via Silesia along the Oder River. Within a year, Levy\u2019s daughter married a Berlin banker Joel Halle, a second great-nephew of Glikl Pinkerle Goldschmidt\u2019s sister, linking to the Hamburg trade. And as Salomon passed away, his widow Sprinz took over.\nBefore 1750, non-Spanish European expansion sought to expand capitalist agriculture. The wars between Britain and France from 1741 to 1763 in North America prompted a shift in British colonialism, necessitating coordination between forces and colonies. Despite the colonies rejecting federal authority in 1754, British management during the war and post-victory unity were acknowledged. After 1750, changes in the British colonial system saw the retention of forts on the Gold Coast, while EAC faced challenges, leading to financial difficulties. The company gave up its charter in 1750, and bases were administered by <italic>Co of Merchants Trading to Africa</italic>. Despite minimal coast administration, financial troubles persisted.\nWhile <italic>Freame</italic> and other goldsmith bankers continued growing, the greater trade during the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic> across the British empire spurred merchant-bankers to generate trade credit by employing Dutch-style chains of bills across London, Paris, and Amsterdam. Contemporaries\u2014including Adam Smith, a distant Smyth cousin\u2014suspected that this process was fraudulent and supported fictious, rather than real bills. \nSince marrying and joining Quaker goldsmith <italic>Freame </italic>as partners, a Barclay married co-religionist Bevan in the 1730s, who joined the bank. As Welsh Bevan was involved in copper refining, <italic>Freame</italic> banked the Quaker <italic>Welsh Mines Royal Copper</italic> and <italic>London Lead Co</italic>. Notably, between 50 to 75% of ironworks in England and Wales during the first half of the 18th century were either owned or managed by Quakers. From 1760s, the Quaker banking partnerships multiplied. While Barclay kinterlinked with the Gurneys of Norwich and Samuel Gurney joined the bank, the descendants of <italic>Bank of Nottingham</italic>\u2019s Smyth family branched to other cities. \nAfter forming the first bank around Birmingham, <italic>Smyth</italic> partnered with Bevan and encouraged iron forging Barclay in-law Lloyd to start a bank after James Barclay died. Eventually, other Barclays bought Smyth out, reinstating the Quaker heritage. Since Abel Smyth married Jane Beaumont in 1745, Quaker linen-draper John Arthington co-founded a textile bank in Leeds with woolen merchant Thomas Lodge, a descendant of the Beaumonts, in the \u201850s. After Lodge\u2019s in-laws kinterlinked with the Anglican Beckett family of merchants related to the Duncombes, the latter gained control of the bank, which they renamed <italic>Beckett</italic>.\nOther goldsmith bankers connected to Scotts. Since apprenticing at Lombard Street\u2019s <italic>Grassho</italic><italic>p</italic><italic>per</italic>\u2014a family of goldsmith bankers tracing bank to Thomas Gresham before developing into a bank, <italic>Martin</italic>\u2014in 1713, Joseph Vere formed his own bank and became Prime Warden of <italic>Goldsmith Co </italic>in 1753. He partnered with Thomas Hallifax, chief clerk at <italic>Martin</italic>, and Richard Glyn, a dye trader and City Sheriff, to found <italic>Vere Glyn Hallifax</italic> in 1754. The same year, Glyn married a daughter of silk mercer Robert Carr, whose niece wed a Drummond. After Vere\u2019s death in 1766, <italic>Glyn Hallifax</italic> became involved in the Scottish Carron ironworks.\nSince <italic>Scottish Trading</italic> failed to amalgamate with <italic>Bank of Scotland</italic>, Archibald Campbell, brother of the Second Duke of Argyll, gained a Charter for <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic>, the second of Scotland\u2019s joint stock banks, in 1727. His second cousin, John Campbell, shared the name of his grandfather, the first Earl of Breadalbane. As a goldsmith, the younger John Campbell joined <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic> part-time, became Secretary in 1737, Second Cashier in 1739, and First Cashier in 1745 until his death in 1777. \nUnlike the private banks, the chartered banks <italic>Bank of Scotland</italic> and <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic> used the clause that gave them the option to suspend convertibility of notes into specie\u2014which saved the banks during the Jacobite rebellion in Scotland and the <italic>Panic of 1745</italic>. Following the uprising, normalcy resumed, and <italic>British Linen Co</italic> received a charter in 1746 to develop Scottish industry, soon issuing circulating notes to do so.\nBefore the Earl of Breadalbane\u2019s first cousin once removed married the daughter of Colonel David Barclay in 1756, his niece wed James Coutts in 1755, forming<italic> Campbell</italic> <italic>Coutts</italic> London.<italic> </italic>Coutts\u2019 father, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne was a merchant who founded <italic>Coutts</italic> in Edinburgh in 1723, later becoming the provost of Montrose and Edinburgh. After William Coutts\u2019 death, his sons became partners of <italic>Campbell</italic> <italic>Coutts</italic>, which was renamed <italic>Coutts</italic> following Campbell\u2019s death. His extended cousin, William Forbes of Monymusk, joined <italic>Coutts</italic> in 1754. For Ireland, Coutts retained Huguenot <italic>Touche</italic> as her agent.\nFrom another family of Scottish clergy and bankers, merchant Robert Arbuthnot married a Forbes and Campbell cousin before moving to Edinburgh in 1762. He partnered with James Guthrie in banking as <italic>Arbuthnot Guthrie</italic> and served as a <italic>British Linen Co</italic> director.\nThe Campbells were also related to <italic>Drummond </italic>by blood and marriage via the Murrays. Henry Murray Drummond partnered with Richard Cox through the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>. Cox, who began as a clerk to Field Marshal John Ligonier, became an agent for the Grenadier Guards and paymaster to the Royal Artillery. With Scottish noble origins and Stewart cousins, Henry married his cousin, Elizabeth Compton, sister of two earls of Northampton, in 1761 and worked with his uncle\u2019s <italic>Drummond</italic> in London, which started by 1712 and competed with <italic>Child</italic> and <italic>Hoare</italic>.\nHenry was part of a social club of financiers and politicians that included Paymaster to the Forces Richard Rigby, Lord of the Admiralty Thomas Bradshaw, diplomat Sir Robert Murray Keith, financier and Under-Secretary of State Anthony Chamier, and brother of the Duke of Argyll Lord Frederick Campbell. By 1768, <italic>Drummond </italic>obtained a contract for paying forces in North America with Thomas Harley, son of the 3rd Earl of Oxford and Mortimer.  \nThe Glasgow-West Indies elites often inter-married between Scottish colonial merchant bankers and farming Tobacco Lords. Born in Scotland in 1739, Alex Campbell began his Caribbean career in 1754. He worked under family members in Barbados, Saint-Christopher, and Dutch Saint-Eustatius. Between 1753 and 1759, he traded tobacco in Virginia and North Carolina under his uncles\u2019 supervision. Campbell was a partner in an Antiguan trading firm from 1759 and conducted business with British-occupied Martinique. In a related set of strategic marriages, four of West Indies trader John Campbell\u2019s sons married into other West Indies families.\nScotland-born Richard Oswald ventured into trade across North America and the Caribbean during the 1730s. By 1741, he became a partner in his cousins\u2019 firm, and later, with substantial profits from the <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic>, he relocated to London in 1746 to trade tobacco, horses, slaves, and sugar. Co-founding<italic> Oswald</italic> in London in 1748, he bought the slave trading outpost Bance Island off Sierra Leone. Two years later, Oswald married the daughter of a wealthy Jamaica merchant, while his cousin married a Campbell of unknown lineage. He partnered with family and other correspondents from North Carolina to Grenada, Calcutta, and Europe, including <italic>Hope</italic> in Amsterdam, <italic>Lamb</italic> in Paris, and Robert Herries. \nHerries was born in Dumfriesshire, Scotland father faced financial difficulties, his uncle saved the family\u2019s fortune by securing  apprenticeship  in 1747. With the assistance of <italic>Hope</italic>, he moved to Barcelona, starting a wine trade business by 1754 and soon expanding to Montpellier, Valencia, and the Mediterranean. After he met John Coutts in Rotterdam, Herries became Managing Partner of <italic>Coutts </italic>as the older partners aged out, alongside William in 1762. Following a dispute over control with the Coutts family, Herries withdrew from his other ventures, settled in London, and renamed the London firm <italic>Herries</italic> in 1766, while Forbes oversaw business in Edinburgh. \nLikewise, Scots entered Georgia, and, by the mid-1760s, controlled commerce in Savannah, Augusta, and Sunbury\u2019s rice trade. In Savannah the leading export houses included <italic>Graham</italic>, <italic>Gordon</italic>, and <italic>Baillie</italic>. <italic>Oswald</italic>\u2019s correspondent John Graham was identified by the governor to the Board of Trade as personally known to London officials. Operating <italic>Gordon</italic> in Savannah and Charleston, John Gordon was related to the Drummond, Forbes, and Barclay families and connected to Lord Adam Gordon, who directed capital into East Florida. Robert Baillie\u2019s father and uncle were Edinburgh businessmen. \nSamuel McCall\u2019s family linked Virginia to Glasgow as his sons engaged in merchant banking and founded the aristocratic <italic>Thistle Bank</italic> in 1761. His granddaughter married Glasgow banker George Thomson in 1749, whose daughter married Edinburgh banker Alexander Bonar\u2014son of a minister of Perth\u2014in 1786, and together they established <italic>Thomson Bonar</italic> in London, focusing on the Russian trade.\nHowever, as American colonies issued commodity- and land-backed banknotes, Rhode Island\u2019s Redwood and other merchants again complained about inflated banknotes in 1750. While Parliament began regulating and restricting notes in 1751, she allowed bank notes to continue depreciating and legalized payment in British specie over<italic> </italic>the<italic> Seven Years\u2019 War</italic>. Following the war, Parliament delegalized the notes in 1763. As the <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> ended the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War </italic>in 1763 returned Guadeloupe to France, it transferred <italic>Indes</italic> territories to establish British rule in Canada and commercial domination of India by EIC. \nWith the <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic>, Britain acquired Grenada, Tobago, Saint-Vincent, and Dominica from France, Britain\u2019s first major Caribbean acquisition in a century. Over the next decade, Grenada planters converted French cocoa and coffee estates into sugar cane, building aqueducts, dams, and mills, which made Grenada Britain\u2019s second largest sugar producer. Unlike in the established colonies, planters took on broader roles, including politics and trades, while relying on Scottish financing.\nA descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, Alexander Campbell did not descend from the Argylls. While his Gordon fifth great aunt married into the family, his descendants kinterlinked with <italic>Middleton Campbell</italic>. In the 1750s, he worked in Barbados, Saint-Christopher, and Saint-Eustatius in the Virginia and North Carolina tobacco trade to 1759, as a partner in a firm in Antigua to 1762, and in commerce with British-occupied Martinique after 1762. He later engaged in politics and managed estates in Grenada, Tobago, and Saint-Vincent. His nephew established <italic>Bartlet</italic> <italic>Campbell</italic> with offices in London, Grenada, Tobago, and the Grenadines.\nBut as Britain passed temporary acts to assist insolvent debtors in 1755, 1761, and in 1765, merchant councils continued to disallow insolvency and bankruptcy statutes passed in colonial Americas. Since the war drastically increased demand for slaves, America switched from importing out of the West Indies to increase direct voyages to the west coast of Africa in search of slaves. After Rhode Island Quakers outlawed the import of slaves after decades of debate in 1761, slavery remained legal for another decade. While <italic>Oswald</italic> expanded into government contracting during the war, they partnered with <italic>Lamb</italic> to buy land after, accumulating extensive properties in the Caribbean and North America from 1762.\nWhile a cousin-in-law of the first Earl of Breadalbane started <italic>Finlay</italic> in 1745 and soon traded cotton with Asia and South America, another Campbell cousin-in-law married the son of Irish Catholic banker George Colebrooke.  Colebrooke had married the daughter of an Irish planter in the West Indies and partnered with Irish and Scottish financiers, including <italic>Nesbitt</italic> in London, <italic>Cantillon</italic> in Paris, and <italic>Hope</italic> in Amsterdam. \nBanking increasingly invested not only in trade finance, but also fixed capital for industry. In Scotland, increased labor competition led collieries to enserf coalers using annual non-competition contracts in 1765. Strikes increased London coal prices by a third, but the system remained. Unlike merchant capitalized banks, Scot landowners founded <italic>Ayr</italic> started in 1769 to fund coal canals for James Watt\u2019s forge. And while <italic>British Linen Co</italic> helped Scotland\u2019s linen industry blossom, <italic>British Linen Co</italic>\u2019s lack of linen sales success led her to pivot solely to banking and investing in coal. \nBritish presence in India had grown since 1707 as a series of short-lived Mughal rulers out of Delhi oversaw the loss of outlying provinces to the Marathas, Jats, Sikhs, and Rohilla Afghans. Invasions by Nadir Shah in 1738 and Ahmad Shah Abdali in the subsequent years severely weakened the Empire. While Jain seth and Hindu bankers collected taxes to fund Muslim Mughals and Christian EIC, the Hindi Marathas and other competitors gradually eroded seths\u2019 traditional business and clientele over decades. As the Marathas launched raids into the Malwa plateau from the mid, Mughal towns decayed as they supported new capitals like Indore and Gwalior. Likewise, invasions by rulers like Nadir Shah and Ahmed Shah Durrani caused financial panic and agrarian disruption. Along with these changes, the Jagat Seth was at the mercy of Bengal\u2019s ruler.\nIn 1733, Jagat Seth Fatehchand supported Alivardi Khan\u2019s ascent to power as Nawab of Bengal. At Fatehchand\u2019s death in 1744, the Jagat Seth title passed to his grandson, Mahatabchand, who secured financing during Khan\u2019s negotiations with the Marathas in 1751. However, as the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic> started the same year that Alivardi died in 1756, a rift developed between Jagat Seth and the new Nawab, Alivardi\u2019s grandson, Sirajuddaulah. So, Jagat Seth funded EIC and overthrew Sirajuddaulah in the Battle of Plassey in 1757. \nFollowing Sirajuddaulah\u2019s defeat, the British installed Jafar as the Nawab. Jagat Seth regained influence in 1760 under Jafar, but it was short-lived as Qasim rose to power in 1763 with the end of the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, leading to Jagat Seth\u2019s downfall. Despite Jafar\u2019s subsequent return to the governorship, Bengal fell under British control after the Battle of Buxar in 1764, replacing local authority with British dominance and Jagat Seths with EIC. While French Bengal taxed rural credit during the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, EIC codified the tax to force EIC credit after defeating the French. Without rural credit, famine struck Bengal by 1770.\nWhile the previously dominant Gujaratis of Surat in the west declined, and Agarwal and Khattri traders became important financiers. In particular, the Hindu merchants of Benares in the north intermediated between local rulers and the trade networks. The Das family, for example, helped Benares settle a forced loan to the Nawab of Oudh. With EIC\u2019s territorial consolidation in Bengal from 1764 after the Buxar victory, the Benares bankers collected and transferred revenues, supporting EIC\u2019s expanding influence. In 1769, Gopal Das became a key financier for EIC after the British acquired the revenue rights to Benares from the Nawab of Oudh. Moving funds from Benares to Lucknow and Calcutta, the Das facilitated the collection and remittance of state revenues from Benares and other regions to EIC\u2019s treasury in Calcutta.\nWith war having depleted resources in Britain, the Navy created a timber reserve and restricted cartels and EIC. Growing insolvent, EIC borrowed from BOE to pay dividends. However, as Scot Alex Fordyce shorted EIC\u2019s stock with credit from Dutch Jews, EIC\u2019s sustained share price and BOE\u2019s refusal to fund Fordyce (possibly because of his engagement with Jews), led Fordyce to fraud. \nAfter Fordyce absconded and precipitated the <italic>Panic of 1772</italic>, <italic>Ayr</italic> and many other Scottish and Dutch houses collapsed, including <italic>Pels</italic> in Amsterdam and <italic>Arbuthnot Guthrie</italic> in Edinburgh. While gold from London quelled the crisis, the Arbuthnot family relied on<italic> Coutts</italic>. Among <italic>Ay</italic>r\u2019s correspondents, <italic>Glyn Hallifax</italic> of London stopped payment. With the death of Richard Glyn, his doctor issued a statement to dispel rumors of suicide. To avoid bankruptcy, Indies linen trader William Mills advanced funds to <italic>Glyn Hallifax</italic> on the condition that he and his nephew Charles joined the partnership, which soon became <italic>Glyn </italic><italic>Mills</italic><italic> </italic>(\u201c<italic>Glyn</italic>\u201d). Charles\u2019 brother William Mills soon became a director of EIC.\nAmidst the crisis, BOE made a loan to a third party to enable them to meet their indebtedness to <italic>Glyn </italic>and allow for the payment bills which were discounted and held by BOE. Likewise, temporary insolvency laws helped British debtors, but British merchants disallowed American debt stays. Moreover, unsold EIC tea accumulated due to high taxes. While EIC cut dividends as BOE withdrew support, Parliament lowered EIC taxes for her to compete with smuggled Dutch tea. As EIC monopolized tea, Bostonian protest led to punitive law, and soon the <italic>American</italic> <italic>Revolution</italic>. \nWith the Scottish and American markets disrupted, Tobacco Lord Robert Herries planned a new monetary service. Rebuffed by the Coutts family, Herries established <italic>London Exchange Banking Co</italic> by 1772 with William Forbes and <italic>Hope</italic>. The bank introduced \u201ccircular notes\u201d, a precursor to travelers\u2019 cheques, from Lisbon to Moscow. After Herries secured the tobacco monopoly for Scotland in 1771, the <italic>Panic of 1773</italic> brought down <italic>Alexander</italic> of Edinburgh, and Herries took over their contracts, securing the tobacco monopolies for London and France by 1774. \nWhile his rivals accused him of undercutting, he failed to renew the French contract in 1775. As Forbes proposed new by-laws to tamper speculation, Herries ended the partnership, separating the London and Edinburgh houses. While Forbes focused <italic>Coutts</italic> on traditional banking, Herries expanded overseas, helping modernize Barcelona\u2019s banking system in 1777. Also in 1777, he married into a family connected with Britain\u2019s first PM Robert Walpole.\nAlthough <italic>Wesse</italic><italic>l</italic><italic>y</italic> of Copenhagen failed in the <italic>Panic of 1773</italic>, Hartwig Wessely rejoined <italic>Ephraim</italic> in Berlin, and recovered as his former correspondents Goldschmidt, Cohen-Barent, and Symons cousin<italic> Boas</italic> floated loans in the Hague to finance Spain\u2019s trading and canal ventures. As Barbe Nettine\u2019s sons died, her eldest daughter took over and became Court Banker following Barbe\u2019s death in 1775. But without Barbe\u2019s power, the bank soon faded and splintered as Austria guaranteed rights to foreigners. Within a year, a Boas wed Cerf Berr\u2019s son, connecting to the most powerful French Jew.\nIn 1774, Samson Wertheim\u2019s grandson Bernhard Eskeles and his cousin, Adam Arnstein\u2014son of Isaac\u2014started Vienna bank<italic> </italic><italic>Arnstein Eskele</italic><italic>s</italic>. After his son Nathan married Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s daughter in 1776, Adam\u2019s brother converted to Catholicism. <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic> soon competed with the Christian <italic>Fries</italic>, <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic>, and <italic>Schwarzenberg</italic> to finance mechanization of Austria\u2019s cloth industry. An aristocratic <italic>Fugger</italic> descendant, Prince Joseph Schwarzenberg received an Austrian charter to start Vienna private bank <italic>Schwarzenberg</italic> in 1788 to promote commerce and provide loans to landowners along with other aristocrats.\nAnother of Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s daughter married K\u00f6nigsberg-born Mendel Oppenheim, of unknown lineage, whose activities included servicing international payments for Ottoman diplomats traveling to Prussia around the turn of the century. While Ephraim and Frankels wed in 1777, several of Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s children married those of his wife\u2019s Wulff and Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s Katz branches. \nAs Itzig-Jaffe became a Parnas of Berlin, he funded his son and Mendelssohn in silk businesses. Although <italic>Ephraim</italic> Berlin closed in 1776, the Ephraims joined Itzig-Jaffe and Mendelssohn in funding the first modern Jewish school in Europe in 1778. Likewise, Itzig-Jaffe funded Mendelssohn\u2019s translation of the Talmud into German with assistance from <italic>Ephraim</italic>\u2019s Hartwig Wessely.  \nDespite endorsements from Berlin rabbis and Britain\u2019s Hirschel Levin, Orthodox Katz-descendants like rabbis Ezekiel Landau and Raphael Kohen opposed publication in 1780. Since the 1740s, Kohen held rabbinates in Polish Rakov, Vilkomir, Minsk, and Pinsk before becoming Chief Rabbi of the united communities of Altona-Hamburg-Wandsbeck in 1777. While Kohen considered excommunication, the King of Denmark\u2019s subscription prevented such action. \nWhile Mendelssohn\u2019s Haskalah aimed for modernization and integration through education and reason, Hasidism, led by charismatic mystics like the Baal Shem Tov, focused on spiritual leadership and emotional devotion. Katz descendant Elijah Solomon\u2014the Wilna Gaon, or the Supreme Authority on Jewish law\u2014condemned Hasidism as heretical and excommunicated its followers in Wilna in 1772. This opposition extended from Brody in Austrian Galicia to Mogilev in Russian Belarus. Instead, the Wilna Gaon . \nSimilarly, Rabbi of Prague Ezekiel Landau\u2019s children married into rabbinical families. His son Samuel married the daughter of Rabbi of Lissa, and led the Rabbinical Board in Prague. Landau\u2019s first daughter married Joseph Hatzaddik, a fellow Katz-descendant, who served as rabbi of Vitkow, Sokol, Jaworow, and, ultimately, Posen. Another daughter married a son of Meir Pressburger of Vienna and his wife, a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim and the Mandl Prefects of Hungarian Jews. \nSince Rabbi Landau sided against the Frankfurt Rabbis in a divorce case, he and his sons were banned from the Frankfurt Rabbinate in 1769. But since Landau had called on Jews to support Austria during the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, Maria-Theresa created the post of Chief Rabbi of Galicia in 1776 to help organize Polish Jews of Brody, Lemberg, and the rest of Galicia. As Landau declined the lifetime appointment, the position went to merchant Aryeh Bernstein, son of a Frankfurt Parnas and grandson of a Katz Wulff descendant. By 1779, Austria granted free trade zone status to Brody.\nBut as Mendelssohn preached emancipation from the ghettos, parnasim feared assimilation would lead to loss of their special status, Christian Alsatians argued for rights to Jews as individuals, but not a class. While Landau opposed Hasidism, he refused to endorse Mendelssohn\u2019s translation after Berliners began to question rabbinical authority. Landau was also concerned about its use for learning German. Although Mendelssohn intended to remove mistranslations, the German version accelerated the replacement of Hebrew in Germany and the Haskalah. \nA year after Empress Maria-Theresa\u2019s death, her son and heir Joseph II revoked old Jewish self-rule in 1781, but retained his grandfather\u2019s restrictions on Jewish marriages. As Vienna relaxed restrictions on Jewish bankers\u2014but requiring identifying dress\u2014Primator of Bohemian rural Jews Joachim Popper soon expanded his bank into Vienna. Within a year, Isaac Arnstein\u2019s grandson Nathan Arnstein, Bernhard Eskeles, and David Wertheim protested collective financial responsibilities.\nAfter the act, Popper, Landau, and the new Primator of Prague Jews Lobl Duschenes\u2014who was Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe\u2019s third-great-grandson, Popper\u2019s brother-in-law, Simon Bondi\u2019s nephew-in-law\u2014agreed to bring the Haskalah to Austrian Jewry, Popper, as the first Prague Jew to reside outside the ghetto, collaborated with Landau and Duschenes to establish Prague\u2019s first modern Jewish German-language school. \nBy 1782, the Emperor issued the <italic>Edict of Toleration</italic> for Lower Austria\u2019s Jews, promoting religious tolerance and secular education, allowing Jews to earn doctorates in law and medicine. As Jews feared that such education would distract Jewish youth from the Talmud, Wessely published a pamphlet urged Austrian Jews to establish schools. While Court Jews Isaac Orchel of France, Elia Morpurgo of Trieste, and Mendelssohn of Berlin commissioned the transition of Wessely\u2019s works into French, Italian, and German, rabbis including Ezekiel Landau, Joseph Hatzaddik, Wilna Gaon Elijah, and Britain\u2019s David Schiff and Hirschel Levin opposed this work.\nOpposing both Hasidism and the widespread use of twisted logic to resolve Talmudic contradictions, the Wilna Gaon championed common sense and rigorous textual analysis in religious study\u2014unlike Mendelssohn\u2019s secular approach. Both the Gaon and Mendelssohn had the support of Russian Prince Potemkin\u2019s Court Advisor Joshua Zeitlin. A descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe like Zeitlin and a Katz and Luria cousin, Schneur Zalman of Liady, founded Chabad, emphasizing intellect over emotion in spiritual practice. By 1784, Zalman faced condemnation from opponents in Mogilev. Although Zalman attempted reconciliation, the Gaon refused to meet with him, worsening the divide. Despite these challenges, Hasidism continued to expand into Wilna, Ukraine, and Hungary, gaining control of the Wilna kahal by the early 1800s.\nWhile Huguenot Court banker Johann Fries lent to the 1780s, his wealth continued grew until his death 1785. As he faced public resentment, possibly due to his foreign Protestant background, and there were rumors of suicide in response to this backlash. Still, his children continued marrying into royalty, including his son who later took over <italic>Fries</italic>. Within a year, Lobl Duschenes\u2019 son married Isaac Arnstein\u2019s daughter, and, through her mother, a granddaughter of Merle Schiff Wertheim and Isaac Liebman, and so a cousin of the Pressburgers who kinterlinked with the British Goldsmid family in 1784, ensuring the gold flow between the two empires.\nEnnobled Christians also dominated Galician wholesale commerce. While most of Brody\u2019s wholesale merchants were Jewish, the few Christians operating in the city, including barons Laszkiewicz and Boesner, held over 20% of the trade and the most capital. Rather than work with guild-like kahals, Aryeh Bernstein imposed taxes and sold monopolies, including to Brody merchant <italic>Nathansohn</italic>, whose son wed Bernstein\u2019s daughter. And as Jewish Galician kahals protested to Vienna, which replaced the Galician Chief Rabbinate with political administration from 1785. \nLike Habsburg Trieste, Prague, and Brody, Ottoman Constantinople, Baghdad in Iraq, and various cities across Syria welcomed Jews for trade and capital. So did multi-cultural India. While Iraqi and Syrian Jews long lived in Bombay, Shalome Cohen of Aleppo made several lucrative ventures in Suret from 1790. As he decided to move to Bombay in 1790, his wife would not follow him. After marrying a Baghdadi Jew, Shalome founded a Jewish community in Calcutta from 1797. By 1816, he was Court Jeweler to the Nawab of Lucknow.\nAleppo\u2019s elite merchant families were a powerful mix of Janissaries, Islamic scholars and judges (ulama), and noble families descended from the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s family (ashraf). With tax exemptions and judicial independence, the Janissaries controlled tax farms, markets, and farmland. Despite the Ottoman\u2019s efforts to rein them in, the Janissaries operated with remarkable autonomy. By the 18th century, many acquired estates and allied with merchants and religious leaders. Their power was visible in tax farming, with Muhammad Shaykhbandar, who controlled key commercial hubs as his brother managed Aleppo\u2019s silk industry in the 1780s. \nAlongside them, the ulama wielded influence through religion and law. They advised Ottoman rulers, mediated disputes, and controlled vast networks of wealth, overseeing schools, courts, and religious endowments. Some, like Ahmad Taha and his son used their status to gain control over the silk trade, while others, such as Qadir Jabiri, secured long-term rights over textile brokerage. Likewise, the ashraf, such as Mamluk judge descendant Kurani and Sufi mystic Kawakibi were exempt from taxes and held political influence. Throughout the century, these elite groups continued to intermarry.\nEarlier in Turkey, Ottoman forces slew Dahir Omar in battle in 1775 and installed Jezzar Pasha the Wali of Sidon and, later, Damascus. Born an Orthodox Christian in Turk Bosnia, Jezzar ran away after raping his sister-in-law, and eventually sold himself into slavery. His conversion to Islam soon freed him and he befriended the future Governor of Egypt. While first preferring Orthodox Christian bankers, Jezzar, soon known as the \u2018Butcher\u2019, grew suspicions about them and appointed Haim Farhi Court Jew of Syrian Sidon and Damascus. By 1776, Farhi\u2019s Gubbay-in-law marry-partnered with David Sassoon, who soon became Nasi of Baghdad. To develop the Galilee, Jezzar offered Farhi and other Jews tax reductions and customs duty benefits. \nWhile Christians and Muslims could turn to religious and political leaders, Jews had less recourse. Following a failed Mamluk coup, Jazzar\u2019s paranoia fueled his determination to eliminate Farhi. In 1794, while Jazzar was away in Hejaz, his officers coordinated the imprisonment and torture of Farhi\u2019s family. While his uncle was tortured to death, Haim had his eye gouged out and parts of his nose and ear cut. Despite the horrors he endured, Haim made a comeback. Following Jazzar\u2019s return, he appointed Haim as his economic advisor, allowing Haim to aiding Galilee\u2019s Jewish community. Farhi also employed Khalil Assaf, a Greek Catholic of Miilya, as an aide and village administrator\u2014entrusting him with financial tasks and property management across Acre. \nThe fates of minority financiers were also the whim of politicians in Egypt. After the Pasha of Cairo had Youssouf Bey, the Jewish treasurer, whipped to death, Antun Faroun, a Greek Catholic from Damascus, took control of Egypt\u2019s customs and in 1775 signed a trade agreement with the British. In 1779 the British ambassador revoked his authority after the merchant Baldwin accused him of involvement in the plunder of a British caravan. Faroun left Egypt in 1784 for Trieste, where he was ennobled. His cousin Yusuf Kassab succeeded him until Isma\u2018il Bey killed him in 1790. Another Greek Catholic, Mikhail Kahil, then purchased the post and held it until the French occupation in 1798. \nWithin months, the French invaded Syria, plundering Armenian monasteries and occupying Gaza, Ramle, and Jaffa, the Muslims of Jerusalem imprisoned 2,000 Christians, suspecting French sympathy. Despite the chaos and uncertainty, Haim remained unwavering in his allegiance to Jazzar, who defeated Napoleon\u2019s occupation forces with British assistance. \nSince Abu Merak became tyrant of Jerusalem, Christians in Damascus faced heavy taxes, under Abdullah the Ottomans reassigned Jerusalem to Jezzar, who rebelled and expelled Damascus Governor Abdullah Pasha. However, when Jezzar passed away in 1804, Haim found himself imprisoned once more. He was eventually released and entrusted with managing Jazzar\u2019s estate and accounts by his successor. However, Armenian churches continued plagued by problems from Napoleon\u2019s invasion and illicit exactions.\nWhile occupying Egypt, Napoleon appointed Ahmad Mahruqi as the shahbandar, responsible for endorsing French-administered laws. Mahruqi, along with another merchant, served on a permanent council established by the French to convey orders to the city\u2019s inhabitants and address their grievances. He also facilitated communication between the French, other merchants, and the influential court banker of Hejaz. \nAkin to the \u2018Pope\u2019 of Sunni Islam, the Ottoman Sultan maintained control over the lucrative trade routes in Hijaz, including the pilgrimage site of Mecca. Governing Mecca since the 10th century, the Hashemite Sharifs, who claimed descent from Prophet Muhammad\u2019s family, were protected first by the Mamluks and later by the Ottoman Sultanate. Allied since 1744, the Saud family, emirs of Diriya, and forces of the puritanical religious reformer Muhammad Wahhab attacked Karbala in 1801, took Mecca in 1803, and raided Iraqi villages.\nThe invasion of Egypt gave rise to Pasha Muhammad Ali. Born in Turkish Albania into a military and tobacco trading family, he collaborated with the Mamluks to overthrow Egypt\u2019s Ottoman governor and became the Governor General of Egypt in 1805. Over the next six years, he suppressed the Mamluks and established fiscal administration. With limited private property rights in Egypt, the government monopolized land ownership. Amidst violence and disorder, soldiers forced serfs to farm. Having secured Egypt, Muhammad Ali embarked on military campaigns in Sudan and Arabia. \nPasha Muhammad Ali\u2019s trusted advisor and chief merchant was Muhammad Mahruqi, who helped reopen caravan trade lines with Hejaz and funding the military. Mahruqi also provided Ali with loans, supplies, and uniforms to officials and soldiers. Led by the sons of the Pasha and Mahruqi, military campaigns against the Saud and Wahhabi forces returned Hejaz to Hashemite control under Cairo protection. However, as the Egyptian regime stabilized, the role of local merchants as suppliers and negotiators became less necessary and their influence waned. While the Egyptian forces destroyed Diriya in 1818, the Sauds reestablished rule in Riyadh in 1824 and expanded their territory.\nAfter Ahmad Mahruqi died in 1813, Muhammad Ali did not confirm Mahruqi\u2019s son Muhammad as sh\u00e3hbandar for nine years as politicians and merchants struggled for control. As Muhammad Ali\u2019s banker, advisor, and chief merchant, Muhammad Mahruqi helped reopen trade routes with Hejaz and supervised various trade and logistics aspects. Muhammad Mahruqi\u2019s son, Hassan, expanded Red Sea trading links to India until British intervention disrupted the trade. As Pasha Muhammad Ali colonized the Sudan, Crete and Greece revolted from Turkey, the Pasha occupied those lands in the 1820s before looking east.\nMeanwhile, Haim\u2019s correspondent and likely in-law, Ezekiel Gubbay, thrived in Turkey. When the Mamluk revolt in Baghdad, Gubbay funded Halet Efendi, who was Sultan\u2019s Mahmud II favorite vizier and connected to the Janissaries, in restoring order and submitting the province to direct Ottoman control in 1810. As a reward, the Sultan appointed Gubbay his personal banker in 1811. As Gubbay became a Court Jew in Constantinople alongside Janissary Paymaster Isaiah Aciman and Chief Tax Collector Isaac Carmona, his brother was appointed nasi in Baghdad in 1817. \nGubbay also developed good relations with the Queen Mother. When Armenian bankers lobbied to get the Jews out of the Court, Gubbay convinced the Queen Mother to have three of the Armenians executed. Unlike Aciman, Carmona was first a banker for Esma, sister of the reigning Sultan Mahmud. Carmona inherited the family bank from his grandfather, who had been a textile importer of Salonica who moved to Constantinople, where he established a bank and advised Sultan Selim III, Mahmud\u2019s cousin who was assassinated in 1807.\nAs conditions improved for Jews in Turkey, they worsened in Syria. While Haim was at the zenith of his power, his patron died, and the successor, Abd-Allah Pasha, allowed a servant of Jezzar\u2019s son to assassinate Haim in 1820. Seeking revenge against Abd-Allah, Farhi\u2019s brothers received aid from Carmona. However, their siege failed, and one of them died in the process. Conditions soon deteriorated turned in Turkey too.\nWhen Gubbay and Efendi accused the Mint Armenian Artun Kazzaz of irregularities in purchasing gold, the Sultan expelled Kazzaz. However, Carmona convinced him to reconsider. Still, the Court Jew Ibn Rahel brothers continued to oppose Kazzaz. As the reformist movement gained momentum, the Sultan dismissed Efendi before executing him in 1823. As the Sultan secretly created of new Westernized troops, he was convinced that the Court Jews were conspiring with the Janissaries. Confiscating the fortunes of twenty-three Jewish banking families, Mahmud also assassinated Gubbay and Aciman. Kazzaz also convinced him to have the Ibn Rahel brothers executed and Carmona strangled during a family dinner. Upon learning about the new Western troops, the Janissaries revolted. Mahmud declared war on the rebels and ordered cannons to attack their barracks when they refused to surrender. Janissaries that were captured alive, were executed after. \nTo court Christian and French favor, Pasha Muhammad Ali also recruited Armenian banker Yeghiazar from Constantinople. When Yeghiazar passed away in 1825, Muhammad Ali invited Yeghiazar\u2019s nephews, Aleksan and Hagop Missakian, from western Armenia to continue their uncle\u2019s banking activities in Egypt. As Armenians ascended as court financiers and pashas in Constantinople, Syria, and Egypt, Muhammad Ali invaded Syria in 1831 but was expelled from Anatolia in 1832 with British and Russian intervention. In 1833, Ali\u2019s son abolished the special poll tax paid by Christians and Jews and imposed new taxes on all Syrians. While Haim\u2019s brother, Raphael, lost his treasurer position in Damascus, Gubbay-in-law David Sassoon came under a death sentence in Baghdad and fled persecution by 1833. \nElsewhere in the Empire, Jews engaged in less risky commerce. In the Ottoman Empire, the opium trade flourished in cities like Izmir and Constantinople. Izmir, near the opium-producing fields of western Anatolia, served as a primary port for exports. Turkish opium, valued for its quality, reached China and other international markets, despite British attempts to monopolize the trade. While Armenian merchants sourced opium from Muslim peasants in Anatolia in the early 1800s, opium examiners in Izmir were Jews included Bochor Taranto of Rhodes, Ishak Abulafia of Tiberias, and Haim Gubbay of Baghdad. In 1831, the Ottoman government centralized the opium monopoly in Istanbul, appointing Taranto as inspector. By 1843, Taranto kinterlinked with the Crespins, descended of Chief Rabbi of Rhodes Moshe Israel. Leading innovations in opium refinement, the Tarantos soon dominated Constantinople\u2019s opium trade. \nAbdulmejid became the Ottoman Sultan upon the death of his father Mahmud II in 1839. As Pasha Muhammad Ali set his eyes on Constantinople, Russia worried about access to the Bosporus and the Dardanelles. Amidst the Pasha\u2019s ambitions for independence, Europe sought to prevent his dominance. After an Italian friar and his servant disappeared in Damascus in 1840, the French Consul suspected Jews and arrest a barber who falsely accused prominent merchants under torture. As Raphael Farhi and other Jewish leaders were arrested and tortured, Jewish communities worldwide\u2014along with allies like Thomas Baring\u2014advocated for support, led by Sephardi banker Moses Montefiore of London. \nBy 1840, with the support of Austria, Prussia, and Russia, British warships bombarded Beirut. In exchange for the hereditary rule of Egypt, Muhammad Ali relinquished his control over Syria, Arabia, and the Aegean. Likewise, he abolished land monopolization, rapidly growing transactions. Until WWI, Muhammad Ali and his descendants minted Ottoman coins in Egypt, featuring only the names of their suzerains, the sultans. \nStarting from 1846, land laws legalized land lets, sales, mortgages, and inheritance. But the government retained the right to expropriate for decades and serfdom continued, as it did along with slavery across Turkey. Also that year, Sultan Abdulmejid proclaimed that Jews would enjoy the same advantages and privileges as others the same year, Raphael Farhi became the senior banker of Damascus and was also appointed to the new provincial council of the empire. Within two years, Sephardi Turks started <italic>Valero Bank</italic> in Jerusalem. In Syria, the Safras built a banking network trading in gold and currency for the caravan trade. They established their first bank, <italic>Safra</italic>, in Aleppo, in the mid-19th century and married into the rabbinical class. The family\u2019s expertise in gold trading dates back generations, and \u2018<italic>Safra</italic>\u2019 means \u2018yellow\u2019 in Arabic, reflecting their early gold market success. After settling in India, David Sassoon\u2019s family established <italic>Sassoon</italic> to manufacture textiles and trade with China by 1844. They soon co-founded a bank that dominated Asian trade.\n<italic>Revolutions of the 18</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> Century</italic><italic> \u2013 Part I</italic>\nLike other religions in legally pluralistic, Jewish communities maintained an oligarchic structure, wherein wealthy laymen, predominantly merchants, bankers, and industrialists, held sway within their communities as well as in international commerce and diplomacy with ties to authorities. While Jews accelerated British capitalism, religious leadership remained bitterly fragmented in England, much less the provinces and colonies. \nLondon\u2019s synagogue traces back to 1690 when Ashkenazi Jews from Amsterdam and Hamburg founded their congregation in <italic>Duke\u2019s Place</italic>, alongside the existing Sephardi community. After Aberle of Hamburg accused the Sephardi David Nieto of heresy, he sought to maintain control and unity by issuing excommunication decrees against secessionists. By 1705, Katz-descendant Zevi Ashkenasy of Altona intervened on behalf of Nieto with support of the Ecclesiastical Court in Altona and Aaron Hart, he earned the admiration of the Sephardi community. As his brother Moses financed the <italic>Exchequer</italic> in the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic>, Aaron Hart took over leadership of <italic>Duke\u2019s Place</italic> that year.\nWithin months, Rabbi Hart privately drafted a divorce for Ensel Kohen, heavily indebted and seeking to escape creditors as a bankruptcy strategy, made plans to leave for the West Indies. In preparation for his departure, Rabbi Hart stipulated the divorce would take effect if Kohen failed to return within a reasonable period. However, diamond merchant Mordecai Hamburger, Glikl Goldschmidt\u2019s son-in-law, challenged the validity of a divorce, citing irregularities in its execution. Hamburger\u2019s objection stirred controversy, reaching <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>. \nThe disagreements escalated with Aberle of Hamburg calling for Hamburger\u2019s excommunication, leading to his ostracism. Despite being banned, Hamburger received support from Rabbi Zevi Ashkenasy and established his own cemetery and<italic> </italic>synagogue. While one of Ashkenasy\u2019s daughters married Hamburger\u2019s brother, her sister wed a son of a Katz-descendant Chief Rabbi of Resha of Galicia, Glogau of Posen, and Amsterdam. Their son, Hirschel Levin, saw his children marry a Gunzburg cousin (of unknown linage) and Katz-descendant daughters of Yitzhak Teomin Frankel and another Frankel.\nAfter Moses Hart\u2019s daughter wed Naphtali Franks\u2019 son in 1720, Moses Hart built the <italic>Great Synagogue</italic> by 1722, which his brother Aaron Hart soon led. And since Mordecai Hamburger\u2019s son married daughter of Benjamin Isaacs, Isaacs laid foundation for <italic>Hambros Synagogue</italic> in 1725. As Oppenheim-in-law Gomperz became Rabbi of <italic>Hambros Synagogue</italic>, his son Barend wed Isaacs\u2019 daughter. Although Aaron Hart claimed to be the first Chief Rabbi of Britain, <italic>Hambros</italic>\u2019 did not accept him. \nA link started with the marriage of Moses Hart\u2019s widowed son-in-law to Hamburger\u2019s daughter. The families again came together during the <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic>, when Hamburger and Naphtali\u2019s grandson helped Britain reclaim Madras from France. Since another of Naphtali\u2019s sons wed Moses Hart\u2019s daughter in 1743, Moses Hart\u2019s cousin-in-law married Dutch merchant David Prager in 1750. As David Prager\u2019s brother branched to London, he expanded into the East Indies diamond trade.\nAfter Aaron Hart died in 1756, Zevi Ashkenasy\u2019s descendant Hirschel Levin led the <italic>Great Synagogue</italic> with acceptance from<italic> Hambros </italic>as the Chief Rabbi of British Ashkenazi. By 1764, a scandal forced Rabbi Levin to resign and David Schiff of Frankfort became Rabbi of <italic>Great Synagogue</italic> upon Goldsmid\u2019s recommendation. While the non-Katz-descendant Schiff styled himself the Chief Rabbi of London and the Provinces, Levin\u2019s fellow Katz-descendant Meshullam Zalman opposed Schiff and became Rabbi of <italic>Hambros</italic>.\nThrough this time, Sephardi and Dutch Jews migrated to London, including the Cohen-Barent, Goldsmid (Goldschmidt), Montefiore, and Rapha\u00ebl families. A linen merchant\u2019s son, Levi Cohen-Barent established in London by 1763. As Levi\u2019s third cousin Rabbi Benjamin Cohen-Barent of Amsterdam thrived as a tobacco planter, Benjamin\u2019s sister married a Goldsmid in Amsterdam in 1767. By 1771, Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s daughter married Barend Gomperz\u2019s son, becoming an in-law of the diamond merchant Hamburgers. \nSince Aaron Goldsmid arrived in London in the early 1740s, Dutch <italic>Mocatta</italic> had kinterlinked with a Sephardi from Livorno and Austrian Court Jew Diego Aguilar\u2019s son before partnering with Alex Keyser\u2014Isaac Liebman\u2019s second cousin once-removed and a Goldschmidt descendant\u2014in 1760, and Keyser\u2019s daughter married Aaron Goldsmid\u2019s son Asher in 1770. \nAnother Sephardi from Livorno, Haim Montefiore, a grandnephew of Solomon Medina, Court Jew to King William III, immigrated to London in the 1750s. There, he imported straw hats from Livorno, which were not produced in Britain. After Isaac Arnstein\u2019s son Adam married Benedict Gomperz\u2019s daughter, he became an Imperial Court Jew in 1762 but threatened to move to Amsterdam before receiving their received the right to reside outside the Vienna ghetto in 1768.\nFrom Central Europe, networks of Jewish traders were rebuilding French and German lands in the aftermath of the <italic>Thirty Years\u2019 War</italic>. Having immigrated to Leimen in the Palatinate during the war, Seligmann Aron\u2019s descendants became Court Jews of the Palatinate Elector Wittelsbach dynasty. As the family\u2019s reputation attracted others to Leimen, his sons adopted the surname Seligmann. The brothers mainly engaged in salt trading in W\u00fcrttemberg, but their children married those of the Austrian tobacco monopolist Israel Popper H\u00f6nig in the 1760s, the Court Jew of Saxony Behrend Lehmann, and Lehmann\u2019s Levy cousins. (\u2018Lehman\u2019 translates into loan man.) \nLikewise, religious leaders from the east returned centuries after expulsion to the Electorate of Treves in the Rhineland. The son of a Rabbi of Lemberg, Aaron Lwow became a Rabbi of Treves. And although he left to be Rabbi of Westofen, he married a Katz-descendant, and their descendants continued to lead the Jewry of Treves. After his wife died, Aaron Lwow remarried an Eskeles, connecting to the Chief Rabbi of Moravia. While one of Aaron Lwow\u2019s sons married the daughter of the Rabbi of Metz, a daughter married a Hirschel Oppenheim, another descendant later married a Katz-descendant who soon became known as Marx.\nBy 1774, Aaron Lwow\u2019s grandson married a granddaughter of Menachem Mandl. Descended from the 16th century Prefect of Hungarian Jews, Menachem (d. 1730) became a Parnas of Pressburg, Moravia. While the Mandls continued to lead Pressburg, Menahem\u2019s son, Abraham (d. 1768), became the Parnas of Hungary, and maintained close ties with the Habsburg court in Vienna, and secured a forty-year monopoly on purchasing the imperial cloth. Since Menachem\u2019s daughter Resi married Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s great-grandson in 1740, their daughters subsequently married Meir Pressburger and Menachem\u2019s grandson. By 1763, Menachem\u2019s other granddaughter Hannah wed Samson Wertheim\u2019s grandson Shamson by 1763, and Shamson\u2019s sister later married Hannah\u2019s cousin. Samson Wertheim\u2019s Brillin great niece also wed Menachem\u2019s grandson. \nWhile Pressburger\u2019s uncle had married Isaac Arnstein\u2019s sister-in-law\u2014the daughter of Isaac Liebman and Merle Schiff Wertheim\u2014, his aunt married the son of the Parnas of Geldern and Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s great granddaughter. Since his cousin married a Schlesingers, Mendel Leidesdorf arrived in Vienna from Pressburg in 1765 and partnered with David Arnstein, son of Isaac Arnstein and the daughter of Isaac Liebman and Merle Schiff Wertheim. That year, Arnstein and Leidesdorf helped reduce the interest on Vienna\u2019s debt. \nAs Leidesdorf died in 1870, Arnstein married his daughter, whose Schlesinger cousin once removed married Menachem Mandl\u2019s grandson in 1774, and Mandl\u2019s great-granddaughter married a Leidesdorf soon after. While Leidesdorf kinterlinked with the Popper H\u00f6nig family, the Mandl and Arnstein families married siblings of the Preisach, connected to Frankfurt and the Schnapper Court Jew family. Another of Mandl\u2019s granddaughters married into the Eybeschutz rabbinical family, cousins of the Bondi and Katz-descendant Eskeles families.\nEast of the Rhine, Oppenheim cousins continued banking Germany. Since Katz-cousin Michael Kulp Speyer wed J\u00fctle Oppenheim\u2014a fellow cousin of Emperor Charles V\u2019s Preferred Jew, Josel of Rosheim\u2014in 1645, their son married Jachet Oppenheim in 1687, the Speyers forged connections with the Frankfurt financiers Flersheim in 1711 and the Kulps repeatedly from the 17th century. While Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s great-nephew Isaac married a daughter of Breslau\u2019s Imperial Mint Jew, Hirschel, by 1703, his granddaughter Sara Guggenheim wed Imperial Court Jew L\u00f6w Zinsheim in 1728. \nAfter Zinsheim\u2019s nephew took the hand of David Kulp\u2019s daughter in the 1730s, Isaac Oppenheim\u2019s daughters wed widowers David Kulp and Michael Oppenheim Speyer. In 1760, the Kulps helped end Oppenheim cousin Kann\u2019s dominance of Frankfurt. In a parallel fashion, as early as 1754, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s first cousin twice removed wed a Flersheim, just like David Feidel. The son of the exclusive Protected Jew of Elgershausen, southwest of Kassel, Feidel became the Court Jew of the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel by 1764, and his son married the daughter of S\u00fc\u00dfel Kulp, David\u2019s brother and Imperial Court Jew in Frankfurt in the 1770s.\nSince not even the archbishops of Cologne could permit residency for his Court Jews since the 15th century, the Elector of Cologne granted protection for Jews in Bonn. Possibly a descendant of King Daivd, Samuel Cah\u00e9n of Deutz moved to Bonn around 1700, his son married the daughter of Rabbi Mehler, a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe\u2019s brother, and joined his father in Bonn. \nAnother son, Lambert, became a Protected Jew in 1729 and married a Geldern, a descendant of Glikl Goldschmidt and relative to the Parnas of Geldern. Of unknown connection to the Cah\u00e9n, Hirsch Cahn of Bonn wed Beyle Speyer. Their son, Jonas, was a merchant from 1748 and opened <italic>Cahn</italic> bank in 1770. Since Salomon Oppenheim, a Katz-cousin and extended cousin of Samuel Oppenheim, left Frankfurt for Bonn in the first half of the 18th century to trade textiles. While his brother married a Cah\u00e9n, Salomon\u2019s daughter married a Frankfurt Goldschmidt and son married a Seligmann and continued in commerce.\nDuring the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War</italic>, Hanover Court Jew, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s grandson Wolf Oppenheim retained his Frankfurt relative, Mayer Rothschild, who was orphaned after a smallpox epidemic in the Frankfurt ghetto in 1755. Learning the collectibles trade during this time, Rothschild began selling coins to Prince Wilhelm of Hesse. In 1770, Rothschild married Gutele Gans Schnapper of Frankfurt. Gutele\u2019s mother, related to the Goldschmidts, married her cousin Wolf Schnapper, who was raised by a Speyer. While Wolf conducted transactions on behalf of the Grand Duke Georg of Sachse-Aleiningen, his son had married Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s daughter\u2019s nephew-in-law, but who died by 1746. By 1780, the Schnappers were the Imperial Court Jews of Austrian Count Metternich. \nAs another of Isaac Oppenheim\u2019s daughters married into the Katz-descendant Lwow-Eskeles clan, he became brothers-in-law with the Politz family dynasty of Nikolsburg rabbis, who also kinterlinked with a son of Emanuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister and Bavaria\u2019s first Court Jew Wolf Wertheim\u2019s son Samuel, a Katz-cousin through this mother. Samuel\u2019s other children included Josef, who became Bavaria\u2019s Court Jew at a young age. While Josef married his Wertheim cousin, his siblings diversified. As one brother became Rabbi of Wertheim, others kinterlinked with Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe descendant Neustadtl and the Mint Jew of Schwerin. \nAnother two sisters wed Oppenheim and Wertheim cousin Gosdorf, the oldest of F\u00fcrth\u2019s mirror glass manufacturers. As Samuel Wertheim\u2019s nephew Zacharias Wertheim married Frommet, Michael Oppenheim Speyer\u2019s daughters with Isaac Oppenheim\u2019s daughter, in 1769, Frommet\u2019s sister Jachet wed Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s third great-nephew Isaak Kann, of a Frankfurt family serving in banking and religious roles in Frankfurt since the 16th century. \nSince Kann\u2019s uncle married a daughter of Samson Wertheim, their son married a Boas in 1756 and engaged in jewel sales and banking together. After Jachet soon died, her Kann widower wed a fellow Katz-cousin, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s third great niece and Wertheim\u2019s great-granddaughter. While active only in Frankfurt, the Kanns branched to the Hague around 1760, forming what became <italic>Lissa Kann</italic><italic>.</italic>\n By the 1730s, another of Oppenheim\u2019s descendants married a son of Jonathan Uffenheimer, who had immigrated from Innsbruck, Austria, to Hohenems on the Swiss border in 1725, where he became a Court Jew to the Counts of Hohenems and led the Jewish community from 1731. For his service as a military supplier during the <italic>War of Austrian Succession</italic>, Empress Maria-Theresa granted Uffenheimer a court factor patent followed by a salt monopoly for Upper Austria.\nOut of Vienna, Oppenheim and Wertheim cousin-in-laws and Katz-cousin Arnsteins worked alongside Hirschels in W\u00fcrttemberg as court factors and army suppliers in the 1750s. By 1762, Isaac Arnstein\u2019s son Adam became an Imperial Court Jew and formed Vienna bank <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic> with his cousin and Samson Wertheim\u2019s grandson Bernhard Eskeles in 1774. But, after the childless Habsburg Elector of Bavaria Maximilian III died in 1777, his successor Karl Wittelsbach expanded Bavaria to include his Palatinate lands, and appointed Josef to deliver silver. A main employer of Seligmann and others, Elector Wittelsbach grew Bavarian Court Jewry.\nAnd <italic>Bondi</italic> thrived in the Electorate of Saxony. Back in 1731, a Teomin Frankel of Berlin descended from Katz, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, Joseph Goldschmidt, and Lipman Cohen-Behrens, married Simon Bondi, who descended from the Kings of Judah and the delBanco family\u2014thus a cousin to the Warburgs\u2014of Prague. Following Empress Maria-Theresa\u2019s expulsion of the Jews of Prague in 1745, the Bondis fled to the Dresden with Salomon Duschenes. While he descended from the Brandeis brother-in-law of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe\u2019s daughter, Duschenes\u2019 cousin Lobl Duschenes, a descendant of Rabbi Lowe, had married Joachim Popper\u2019s sister. As  Duschenes obtained a permit to supply Dresden\u2019s mint with Bondi, the soon rivaled Gerd Levis. By 1752, Bondi began supplying the Dresden Mint silver and established <italic>Bondi</italic> in 1755 to focus on FX through the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War</italic>. \nAfter the <italic>Seven Years' War</italic>, Court Jew migration to Saxony from Austria and Prussia resumed. From Prague like the Bondi, Prague-born Philippine married Polish-born Jacob Kaskele. As Poland was under the Saxon Elector, he received permission from the Elector in 1771 to reside and conduct business in Dresden. In 1772, he was appointed court agent, established a bank, and traded goods, including grain. Likewise, the Jewish population of Leipzig grew to ten individuals, including Herz Jacob, a relative of the Wulff family from Dessau, who obtained Protected Jew status in the late 1760s.\nWhile Johann Liebman\u2019s older Sephardi brother-in-law may have lived (and died) in German Lorraine during the <italic>Thirty Years\u2019 War</italic>, French King Louis XIV gained parts of Alsace and Lorraine after the <italic>Thirty Years\u2019 War</italic> in 1648 and protected those Jews from 1657 and seized the Saar in the 1680s, his descendants owned 9 Alsatian towns with over a thousand Ashkenazim. Other landowners with significant Ashkenazi populations included Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt with 21 private towns and the Prince Bishop of Strasbourg, with 16. Likewise, the Counts of Leyen owned extensive lands and villages like M\u00e9delsheim in the mineral rich Saarland. Since Facing heavy taxes, few legal rights, and expulsion from most cities, Jews from Central Europe began supplying horses and provisions, especially to free Lords hostile to the Crown. \nLike in Poland, kinterlinked dynasties and merchants held rabbinical posts in France and Germany. While Lazarus Katz and his son presided in Haguenau, fellow Katz-descendants Wahl held sway in Regisheim. Among the first Jews in Alsace, were the Netters from around Strasbourg. After Nathan Netter\u2019s acquisition of the Rosheim salt distribution tax farm in 1661, his son, recommended by the King\u2019s Lieutenant General, established the Jewish community in Rosheim. From there, Nathan Netter\u2019s grandson Itzig Netter became one of the three Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s of the Jews of Alsace. \nFollowing the <italic>Treaty of Ryswick</italic> in 1697, Duke of Lorraine and Habsburg cousin Leo married a niece of France\u2019s Louis XIV and raised funds by attracting rich Jews from Metz to Nancy. Since Glikl Goldschmidt\u2019s stepson Samuel Levy-Wimpfen became the Chief Rabbi of Upper Alsace in 1700, he relocated to Lorraine to supply the Duke Leo\u2019s Court in 1709, Alsatians replaced Levy-Wimpfen with Sanvil Weyl in 1711. \nOf the Weil rabbinical chain family, Weyl\u2019s grandfather Jacob Weyl had served as the seigneurial supervisor for the Jews of Pfaffenhoffen, intervening in a conflict in 1678 and managing a debt repayment in 1680. In 1690, he supplied cattle and stallions to the royal army. Libmann, Baruch, and other sons continued his work after his death by 1695. Libmann managed pastures and salt farming, while Baruch severed as a parnas and was one Alsace\u2019s wealthiest Jews. While Baruch\u2019s daughter married Wolf Guggenheim in 1710, his son was Sanvil, whose family soon kinterlinked Levy-Wimpfen\u2019s son-in-law and other rabbis across the region.\nStill, the Jews faced competition in banking and industry from Protestants. The Huguenot Dietrich family had fled Lorraine for Strasbourg in the 16th century. In 1684, Jean Dietrich, a Lutheran banker, purchased the Jaegerthal forge, marking the family\u2019s transition to ironmaking. Fellow Huguenot Wendel left Bruges after Spain sacked Antwerp in the late 16th century and settled in France. His descendant, Jean-Martin became the director of the Ottange forges in 1704. Using advances from Jewish bankers in Metz and Thionville, he acquired the Hayange forges the following year. In 1727, he secured noble status from the Duke of Lorraine and his son married the Lorraine Receiver General\u2019s daughter and leased more state-owned forges.  \nEarlier than in Alsace, Jewish bankers arose in Nancy and Metz in ducal Lorraine, where most were linked to the rural economy, including trading grains, livestock, and money lending. \nLion Halphen Goudchaux of Metz began his trading activities in Lorraine around 1688 and settled there following the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic> around 1714 as his brother-in-law wed Sanvil Weyl\u2019s brother. (<italic>H</italic><italic>alphen</italic> derives from a Hebrew word for <italic>money changer</italic>.) Supplying horses to the French army in Metz, he was allowed to relocate to Malz\u00e9ville in 1717, the year of Levy-Wimpfen\u2019s bankruptcy, as his second cousin once removed\u2014who was also his daughter\u2019s sister-in-law\u2014married Wolf Guggenheim\u2019s cousin, the banker Jacob Guggenheim. \nLikewise, Worms-born Jacob Worms had moved to Metz and married there. By 1690 he settled in Sarrelouis as a moneylender. His son Olry, born in Metz, married the daughter of a forge operator from Nikolsburg, who together received permission to return to Sarrelouis as military meat suppliers. \nAmidst suspected usury following the <italic>Panic of 1720</italic>, Duke Leo exiled all the Jews who had migrated to Lorraine after 1680, allowing only 73 families, including four in Nancy. While Goudchaux\u2019s children married a daughter of Katz-descendant Chief Rabbi of Treves Lwow-Eskeles in 1721, Aisik Orchel three years later, and the daughter of a wealthy Jew from Mutzig in 1725. \nRelated to the priestly Traub of Mainz, the Orchels lived in Frankfurt and Hanau since before the <italic>Thirty Years War</italic>, kinterlinking with Schiff and Oppenheim. At that point, Goudchaux moved to Nancy, from where he sold German horses to Duke Leo\u2014providing all cavalry remounts in 1729\u2014and engaged in secondhand clothes trading and money lending. Likewise, Itzig Netter\u2019s son Leyman wed Court Jew of Mannheim Moses Oppenheim\u2019s daughter in 1728. \nFollowing the death of Duke Leo of Lorraine, his son Francis inherited the post and soon sought to marry his Habsburg cousin Maria-Theresa, Emperor Charles VI\u2019s daughter. However, France feared Habsburg proximity. So, following the loss of<italic> War of the Polish Succession</italic>, the Duke traded Lorraine to French King Louis XV\u2019s father-in-law Stanislaw Leszczy\u0144ski in exchange for Tuscany after the death of the last Medici Duke in 1737. \nFollowing Lion Goudchaux\u2019s death that year, two of his sons took over the family business and a third established a military forage enterprise in Lun\u00e9ville. Another obtained the right to inherit his father-in-law\u2019s warehouse business and later became a merchant to Leszczy\u0144ski\u2019s Court. After the death of his Goudchaux wife, Aisik Orchel married Katz-cousin Judith\u2014a relative of the Parnas of Geldern and the granddaughter of Johann and Esther Liebman, and so a cousin of the Pressburger and Goldschmidt families\u2014by 1740, who birthed Isaac Orchel. By 1753, Leszczy\u0144ski appointed Aisik as one of the three Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s of Jewish Lorraine. \nAfter the <italic>War of the Austrian Succession</italic>, the Count of Leyen faced financial difficulties, and leased his Saar iron forges in 1749 to an Ashkenazi consortium including Dov Berr. While Berr\u2019s M\u00e9delsheim-born son Cerf had just married Abraham Weyl\u2019s daughter, his daughter wed the son of the Rabbi of Treves, Rabbi of Strasbourg David Sinzheim, whose nephew-in-law Selig Auerbach was sous-Rabbi of Bouxwiller. And as his cousins married Katz-descendant Wahls and daughter wed Sanvil Weyl\u2019s niece in 1751, Leyman Netter became a Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 in 1754, and his son wed one of Lion Goudchaux\u2019s granddaughter in 1755. At the twilight of the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War</italic>, Leyman\u2019s daughter wed Dov Berr\u2019s son, a Rosheim tax farmer, by 1762. \nThat year, Moses Mendelssohn married Fromet Guggenheim\u2014Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s great-granddaughter and Jacob Guggenheim\u2019s first cousin once removed\u2014Guggenheim and Weyl strengthened ties between French and German Jewry. Likewise, a Katz descendant, who formerly held the chief rabbinates of Minsk and Volozhin, was elected Chief Rabbi of Metz in 1765 until his death in 1785.\nA French Edict of 1767 shifted ennoblement from military or court service to economic contributions. The edict introduced stricter criteria, requiring proof of commercial success, employment, and tax contributions. Although bankers were not explicitly covered by the edict, a few prominent financiers received letters of nobility, reflecting their growing influence. Overall, the edict aimed to control and limit the number of new nobles from commerce and finance, reflecting changing royal priorities. Although requirements initially required Catholicism, enforcement relaxed, allowing some Huguenot merchants and bankers to be ennobled. The same did not hold true for Jews.\nAfter famine struck France in 1770, Cerf Berr provided for the people, gaining citizenship from Louis XVI in 1775. As the only Jewish citizen in all of France, he was allowed him to own property, which he used to establish factories and employ Jews, helping them move away from petty trading. Within a year, Cerf Berr\u2019s son wed a <italic>Boas</italic>, connecting to the Anglo-Dutch cousin of the Goldschmidt, Cohen-Barent, and Symons families. \nBy then, another of Lion Goudchaux\u2019s granddaughters\u2014a daughter of Nancy banker\u2014married Goudchaux\u2019s step-grandson Isaac Orchel (1761), who inherited his father\u2019s Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 position, became a tobacco manufacturer, and later Cashier of Cerf Berr\u2019s Nancy storehouses. Goudchaux\u2019s other granddaughters married a Marx in 1749 and an Aron in 1774. Since Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 of the Jews of Alsace Itzig Netter\u2019s sister had married Goudchoux cousin Marc Aron, whose brother Joseph married a Dreyfus. The latter had a son, Isaac, around 1720 in Phalsbourg. \nIsaac Aron began lending in 1743, a year after marrying the daughter of Lion Dreyfus of Wissembourg. Two years later, Isaac\u2019s cousin Alexandre married a Weil, and later served as the Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 of the Jews of Phalsbourg. In the 1760s, another Aron cousin married the daughter of Joseph Steinhart, who had succeeded an Aron as Chief Rabbi of Strasbourg. Alexandre\u2019s son, Louis, received royal permission in 1774, to establish himself in Nancy. He married the daughter of Gitl\u00e9, Lion Goudchaux\u2019s daughter, and Michel Orchel Wolff, a Nancy merchant banker. By 1777, Isaac was the wealthiest Jew of Phalsbourg.\nOther Goudchaux and Orchel cousins kinterlinked with Cahen, Gomperz, and Goldschmidt families in Metz. Goudchaux extended cousins also participated in the kinterlinks. By 1734, Lion Goudchaux\u2019s second cousin once removed wed his daughter to Cahen cousin Bernard Fould, whose second cousin once removed was married into the family of the Chief Rabbi of Treves Lwow Eskeles. Originating from the community of Fulda, the Foulds migrated to Metz in the late 17th century, and expanded commerce and lending into Mannheim by 1744. By the 1770s, Bernard\u2019s grandson Lion Fould became Cerf Berr\u2019s apprentice.\nOf unknown relation to the other Netters, Hirtzel Netter banked, traded grain, and supplied munition in the German County of Hanau. He married the sister of Abraham Lipman, who joined his father to bank and supply the seigneurial court from 1730, buying iron from <italic>T\u00fcrckheim</italic>, a prominent Huguenot trading houses of Strasbourg to the Azroir guild. Lipman\u2019s father served as Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 of Bouxwiller from 1733 to 1739. Abraham married Sarah, daughter of Jacob Reichshoffer. \nReichshoffer had arrived in Bouxwiller by 1708 and, by 1727, took over the lease for the Zinswiller forges and secures the monopoly of the iron trade in Hanau with Lipman from Christians who had leased forges since they counts created them the late 15th century. Reichshoffer became community leader by 1732 and his daughter had married Moise Elias of Epfig, together securing the Zinswiller forge lease in 1751 and became the sole Master of Forges by 1755. After signing a nine-year agreement with the local lords a year later, his son married Jonas Aron\u2019s daughter. Along with serving as excise farmer for Pfaffenhoffen from 1758, Reichshoffer operated the Zinswiller forges with his sons-in-law Elias and Lipman, and leased iron mines in Bitschhoffen with them, Lipman\u2019s brother Isak, and Hirtzel Netter\u2019s son Raphael. Raphael also married Isaac Aron\u2019s daughter and held a playing card monopoly, managed a lottery, and partnered with Isak in salt farms.\nMeanwhile, Hirtzel Netter was tasked with acquiring wood lots for the Huguenot Dietrich family\u2019s ironworks. In the 1760s, both Louis XV in France and the Holy Roman Emperor Francis I ennobled the family. Jean III Dietrich (1719-1795), who married a daughter of a wealthy banker in 1745, renounced banking to focus on metallurgy. He acquired the Zinswiller forges in 1764 and built new plants and blast furnaces. Increasingly, Christians pushed Jews out of industry.\nAfter losing control of Zinswiller, Moise Elias\u2019 first cousin twice removed wed Cerf Berr\u2019s daughter in 1770 and, since Jonas Aron's widow married Isaac Orchel\u2019s nephew in 1769, their daughter wed Elias\u2019 son in 1771. The Elias family continued to serve as financiers and suppliers to local courts and clients in Bouxwiller and Alsace. As one brother served as a rabbi in Lixheim, another was the Parnass of Bouxwiller. \nWhile the Elias brothers collapsed in bankruptcy by 1784, the Huguenot Ignace Wendel, along with British steelmakers, obtained a royal charter for <italic>Creusot</italic> forges, with capital from the state, Collector General, Paymaster General, and Claude P\u00e9rier, to supply the royal artillery. P\u00e9rier\u2019s brother worked for Jean-Joseph Laborde at <italic>Indes</italic>. By then Huguenot banker Bernard T\u00fcrckheim, having inherited Strasbourg trading firm <italic>T\u00fcrckheim</italic> from his father, expanded banking operations and supported commercial ventures. Indeed, Habsburg Emperor Joseph II made his brother Jean a German baron in 1782.\nBut banking was not limited to men. After Saxon Court Jew Jakob Kaskele died in 1788, his widow Philippine received permission from the Saxon elder Bondi to lead the family business for two decades, before her progeny took over, and later founded <italic>Dresdner Bank</italic>.\nBorn in 1739 in Buchau, W\u00fcrttemberg, to a Court Jew in Hechingen and Sigmaringen, Chaile Ratisbonne Kaulla married Akiva Auerbach, a Katz and Luria cousin whose father traded horses, in 1757. While they had at least six children, Akiva devoted himself to religious studies. By 1760, Chaile took over her father\u2019s business at 21 and, eight years later, was became the Court Jewess of F\u00fcrstenberg, the first woman in southwestern Germany to serve as a contractor and court factor. Within a year, she became W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019s Court Jew, Joseph-S\u00fcss Oppenheim\u2019s position a generation earlier. While Karoline\u2019s horse and jewelry trade allowed her to hire her brothers, the new Prince of F\u00fcrstenberg refused to renew her contract in 1783. \nFor a long time, the only Jews in Le Havre, the Ashkenazi Levy family had immigrated from Mainz and adopted the surname Homberg. By 1732, Henri Homberg married Suzanne Gomperz. After Henri\u2019s death around 1745, his widow took over <italic>Homberg</italic>. Suzzane\u2019s sister, meanwhile, married Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s Guggenheim grandson, and their daughter wed Moses Mendelssohn by 1762 in Berlin. \nDuring the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War</italic>, the widow Homberg diversified <italic>Homberg</italic> to trade with Russia and supply timber to the royal navy. In 1762, Homberg started a Le Havre maritime insurer. Expanding business, <italic>Homberg</italic> embarked on various sea voyages to the West Indies, Saint-Domingue, Angola, and Port-au-Prince. Not until after Suzanne death in 1775 did <italic>Homberg</italic> enter the triangular slave trade from 1783. By then, Homberg\u2019s insurer became the most important of Le Havre\u2019s six insurers.\nBy 1769, Suzanne received letters of privilege as a linen maker and in 1770 applied for citizenship, which was denied by Le Havre\u2019s city council and governor due to her faith. Since she was Jewish and born to non-French parents, Suzanne died in 1775, her children remained foreigners subject to the droit d\u2019aubaine, allowing the King of France to inherit the possessions. Their naturalization process coupled with their conversion to Catholicism in 1785, marked their integration into French society, allowing them to establish social connections, inherit assets, and further their trade.\nLikewise, Protestant widows became bankers. After inheriting her husband\u2019s Frankfurt bank in 1763, widow Rebekka Olenschlager hired bookkeepers rather than remarry. And the Crowns of Portugal to Germany routinely granted wives, daughters, and widows\u2014of all religions\u2014the same privileges and concessions as their deceased male family members. Upon the death of London banker <italic>Child</italic>\u2019s Samuel Child in 1752, his widow, Agatha, and sons, Francis and Robert, carried on <italic>Child</italic>. As Agatha and Francis died in 1763, Robert became Head Partner and married Sarah Jodrell. Their daughter wed 10th Earl of Westmorland John Fane in 1782.\nAt the same time, widows from Portugal, through Germany, to the Baltic and Scandinavian coasts represented up to 10% of shops, mines, and traders, and paying up to 20% of taxes in some cities. Even in smaller Rhineland cities, Protestant widows carried some of Germany\u2019s longest lasting family businesses. While Aletta Haniel directed her husband\u2019s shipping firm after he died in 1782 until her son reached majority, Helen Krupp invested in Rhenish mining companies and refused to relinquish managerial authority to her son. \nHowever, geopolitics inflated the prices of  West Indies commodities and Black slaves. Sugar was the most valuable commodity imported to France and England from overseas, and the Caribbean became commercially more important to England than Asia. While America imported slaves from the West Indies since the 1730s, the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War</italic> increased demand, leading to an increase in direct voyages from local vessels to the west coast of Africa in search of slaves. \nEnding the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War </italic>in 1763, the <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> returned Guadeloupe to France and established British rule in Canada and commercial domination of India by EIC. Along with wartime military debts, the loss of territories stifled <italic>Indes</italic>. Increased French coffee production in the Antilles soon deflated prices, fueling instability in Dutch Surinam and elsewhere in the West Indies by 1771, which the <italic>Panic of 1772</italic> exacerbated, forcing many planters to leave, and fueling a new cycle. \nDuring the <italic>American Revolution</italic>, British forces promised land and funds to Black loyalists against the revolution colonies. After the war, the decline in British sugar imports caused distress among refiners, who petitioned Parliament for relief. This led to a push for increased sugar cultivation in the Caribbean, raising the prices of slaves. But the extension of farming into areas prone to hurricanes and droughts stimulated famines. \nLarge partnerships dominated the British transatlantic slave trade. William Boast along with Peter Baker and his son-in-law John Dawson, the son of a poor farmer, dominated the trade out of Liverpool, handling almost two-thirds of the traffic from 1783 to 1792. After Dawson\u2019s metric during the <italic>American</italic> <italic>Revolution</italic>,<italic> Baker Dawson</italic> held a contract with Spain from 1785 to 1788 and continued as leading supplier to the Spanish Caribbean, opening a merchant bank along the way.\nBritain\u2019s Parliament did not ease debt imprisonment or redirect prisoners to collieries after America\u2019s <italic>Revolution</italic>. Instead, Parliament promoted Australian debt colonies and free labor coal mining, delegalizing Scots slavery in 1775. But as White poverty and indentured servitude grew, so did calls to limit the import of Black servants. By then, the free Blacks of London organized into a structured community, with Black pubs, churches, and meeting places. \nAnd as poverty grew, the Black community protested the imprisonment of two men for begging. Likewise, Britain experienced a rise in abolitionist activism, marked by boycotts, newspaper campaigns, and petitions against slavery. At the other extreme, Blacks gained prominence. While concert violinist George Bridgtower knew Beethoven, Ignatius Sancho corresponded with novelist Laurence Sterne. Alongside individuals such as Francis Williams who studied at <italic>Cambridge</italic> and Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, grandson of an African king, married an English widow, and later published his memoirs.\nSome Blacks also reached new heights in Europe. Abram Gannibal, born in Cameroon, around 1696, the son of a princeling of Kota. He was captured as a child by neighbors and sold into slavery to the Ottomans, before becoming a servant in the Sultan\u2019s court. He was then brought to Russia for Tsar Peter Romanov, baptized, and educated in France. Gannibal served as an engineer and military officer under Peter, eventually becoming his godson and tutor to Peter II. After Peter\u2019s death, he fell out of favor, facing exile to Siberia. Despite a tumultuous first marriage, he later married a noble, with whom he had seven children. Gannibal retired to a plantation in 1733 but returned to service under Tsarina Elizabeth, rising to the rank of full general by 1759. His progeny includes the aristocratic novelist Alex Pushkin, a great-grandson.\nMeanwhile, North German Lutheran families established trading empires, including Baring, Kleinwort, and Schr\u00f6der. By 1779, John Baring\u2019s son Francis joined EIC\u2019s board and in 1784 became the first of his family to serve in Parliament. As Francis\u2019 son Alex, trained with <italic>Hope</italic> in Amsterdam, where his co-apprentice, Pierre Labouchere, the son of a Huguenot clothmaker, married Francis\u2019 daughter. Following the death Joachim Kleinwort, his estate was equally divided per the prevailing law, which his youngest son, Hinrich, used to start importing British goods into Hamburg by 1786 and Amsterdam soon after. \nLike North German Lutherans, Swiss Huguenots held numerous high offices and engaged in commerce. In the 1730\u2019s, Eschers installed northeast Switzerland\u2019s first hydraulic motor-powered silk spinning mill. Eschers also joined other Swiss families to fund loans for Scandinavians to buy colonies in the West Indies by 1760.\nAfter his Huguenot father fled France in 1730 for London and married a Dutch expatriate, their London born son Isaac Panchaud engaged in the Indies trade before moving to Paris in 1763 to bank with cousin in Switzerland. By 1767, Laborde established <italic>Caisse d\u2019Escompte </italic>with Louis XV\u2019s support to intermediate advances to the King. But as Issac Thellusson\u2019s partner, the Swiss Huguenot Jacques Necker, quarreled with Panchaud about fusing state debt with <italic>Indes</italic>, Necker convinced France to separate <italic>Indes</italic>\u2019 commercial and royal functions by 1768, and France abolished <italic>Caisse d\u2019Escompte</italic>. After reorganizing <italic>Indes</italic>, Necker utilized Swiss bankers to create a market for <italic>Indes</italic> debt. By 1772, Panchaud married a deceased <italic>Indes</italic> official\u2019s daughter. \nBefore dying in 1764, French Court Banker Jean-Paris Montmartel\u2019s heiress and King Louis XV\u2019s mistress Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson financed Pierre DuPont\u2019s essay on landed capitalism. DuPont was born to Anne Monchanin, of a formerly wealthy French family impoverished by their commitment to the Huguenot faith, and Samuel DuPont, a Rouen watchmaker and one of eleven children from a modest home. \nWith Poisson\u2019s blessing, baron-turned-financier Jacques Turgot guided DuPont to the role of editor of the King\u2019s <italic>Journal of Agriculture, Commerce, & Finance</italic>. By 1771, Turgot became the godfather of Pierre\u2019s son Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e. And as Louis XVI was crowned King in 1774 with his wife Marie-Antoinette, daughter of the Habsburg Empress Maria-Theresa, Turgot became Controller General of Finances and Pierre became Inspector General of Commerce. \nWhile Turgot organized a new <italic>Caisse d\u2019Escompte </italic>with support from DuPont, he was dismissed in 1776. As Louis XVI sought a <italic>Treasury</italic> <italic>Controller</italic> but created a post for Necker due to concern about appointing a foreign Huguenot as Controller General. But while Panchaud formed a new <italic>Caisse d\u2019Escompte </italic>with <italic>Mallet</italic>, <italic>L</italic><italic>essert</italic>, other Huguenots that year, Necker soon evicted him. By 1780, Catholic DuPont became an honorary knight in the Bureau of Finances.\nAs some Huguenot Cazenoves returned to France from Switzerland, others moved to Amsterdam, and James Cazenove emigrated to London, where he wed a French pastor\u2019s daughter. From 1781, Huguenot Dublin-born banker and MP David Touche negotiated to found a national bank. In 1783, Parliament granted <italic>Bank of Ireland</italic>\u2019s charter, which excluded Catholics and Quakers from the board and was allowed to have more than six shareholders. Touche became the bank\u2019s Governor, and his brothers joined as directors. As his cousin William returned from EIC service, he married the daughter of co-religionist London banker John Puget,  who became <italic>Bank of Ireland</italic>\u2019s London correspondent. Refining gold from the 1750s, <italic>Puget</italic> transferred  Irish Treasury Bills for Bank of Ireland and became Governor of BOE from 1790.\nLike the Haskalah spread for Jews in German lands, the power of the Catholic Church waned in France, promoting secularization from the 1760s, and decreasing family sizes against Church doctrine. France followed Germany in limiting the autonomy of Jewish courts in 1777. As false receipts flooded Jewish loans in Alsace amidst anti-Jewish propaganda, Cerf Berr sought Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s aid. To bridge Christian and Jewish perspectives, Mendelssohn enlisted Christian Wilhelm Dohm to advocate for Jewish civil rights in a 1781 pamphlet. Despite limited distribution in France, ideas of emancipation from the ghettos spread. \nBut that same year, without Jewish Courts, Rabbi Lehmann outbid Cerf Berr for an army delivery contract. As the bidding war attracted a Christian, both Jews lost the contract. While Berr\u2019s brother-in-law Rabbi Sinzheim excommunicated Lehmann, Frankfurt\u2019s rabbinical college intervened and lifted the ban in favor of Lehmann. Likewise, Berr\u2019s agent Isaac Orchel, tobacco manufacturing banker of Nancy, promoted assimilation and refuted the conflict between religious and civic duties, commissioning the transition of Hattwig Wessely\u2019s Haskalah works into French by 1782. \nAlthough Dutch Christian banks continued to discriminate again Jews in their large state loans issued to Poland and other governments, <italic>Boas</italic> became the sole Dutch Jewish state financier. Starting in 1780, they lent to Gustav III of Sweden. In 1781, <italic>Boas</italic> loaned 1,000,000 <italic>florins</italic> to Habsburg Emperor Joseph II. Between 1781 and 1786, they loaned over 500,000 <italic>florins</italic> to the Prince of Waldeck. They also loaned 200,000 <italic>florins</italic> to Hessen-Homburg, 450,000 <italic>florins</italic> to Nuremberg, 350,000 <italic>florins</italic> to British Princes, and 2,000,000 <italic>florins</italic> to Li\u00e8ge. Additionally, <italic>Boas</italic> managed debts for Copenhagen\u2019s<italic> Royal Exchange Bank</italic>, the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, and the Duke of Brunswick, extending financial support to these entities during this period.\nBy 1781, Anglo-Dutch Levi Cohen-Barent became London\u2019s leading trader of Brazilian diamonds, that he consigned to <italic>Hope</italic>. That year, Cohen-Barent\u2019s Boas descendant niece married Mozes Nijmegen Ezechiels\u2014a brother-in-law of Abraham Goldsmid through the Vries family\u2014who founded <italic>Ezechiels</italic> in Rotterdam that year. Since Abraham\u2019s father Aaron Goldsmid arrived in London in the early 1740s, one of his sons and joined him in trade, while another son wed the niece of former Chief Rabbi Hart\u2019s cousin-in-law and Anglo-Dutch East Indies diamond merchant David Prager and founded <italic>Goldsmid</italic> broker with his brother in 1783. \nWithin a year, one of Aaron Goldsmid\u2019s sons married a Nijmegen, whose Dutch diamond merchant brother married one of Aaron\u2019s daughters and joined <italic>Goldsmid</italic>, while another of Aaron\u2019s daughter wed a Pressburger, a grandson of Merle Schiff Wertheim and Isaac Liebman, whose Arnstein cousin kinterlinked with the Austrian Duschenes Popper family two years after. \nSince <italic>Mocatta</italic> partnered with Alex Keyser\u2014Isaac Liebman\u2019s second cousin once-removed and a Goldschmidt descendant\u2014in 1760, Keyser\u2019s daughter married Aaron Goldsmid\u2019s son Asher, in 1770. Aaron Goldsmid\u2019s fifth cousin out of Frankfurt, Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s second great-grandson Amschel engaged in extensive trade, rising from a Protected Jew, to a Commerce Court Jew, and finally an Imperial Court Jew in 1776. From the Tuscan Port of Livorno, Haim Montefiore, a grandnephew of Solomon Medina, Court Jew to King William III, immigrated to London in the 1750s. There, his son, Joseph, imported Italian goods and married Rachel Mocatta in 1783. The same year, Amschel Goldschmidt\u2019s second cousin twice removed married Mayer Rothschild\u2019s sister in Frankfurt.\nAlong with consolidating power for a given banker, some kinterlinks united disparate families. Serving as a Court Jew of Bonn since 1761, Baruch Mergentheim became the Electoral Palatinate\u2019s Court Jew in 1768. After his daughters married the Imperial Court Jew L\u00f6w Eskeles\u2019 son in 1770 and David Schnapper in 1775, Mergentheim financed the election of the Archbishop and Coadjutor of Cologne and M\u00fcnster, securing significant political influence for the House of Habsburg, in 1780. Mergentheim\u2019s children went on to marry Joachim Boas in 1780, Julia Gomperz in 1781, and David Goldschmidt in 1782.\nBack in 1782, Habsburg Emperor Joseph II issued the <italic>Edict of Toleration</italic> for Lower Austria\u2019s Jews, promoting religious tolerance and secular education. Following his brother-in-law, Louis XVI of France abolished the body tax on Jews and animals, issuing letters patent extending new opportunities in commerce and industry to the Jews of Alsace. These letters aimed to restrict the growth of the Jewish population and limit usury. However, Strasbourg authorities declared Cerf Berr\u2019s ownership of an estate invalid because he was Jewish and lacked the right to own property in the city. \nBerr argued that his 1775 letters patent of naturalization allowed him to own property anywhere in France, but the authorities contended that he purchased the hotel before receiving his naturalization papers. Although the status of Jews in France remained largely unchanged, wealthy Lorraine Jews obtained permits to buy property outside of their ghettos. Since Berr married a fellow widow of Strasbourg banker Ratisbonne, herself a great-granddaughter of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, in 1784, his niece married Goudchaux-in-law David Aron of Phalsbourg, and his daughter wed the son of Michael Speyer, who became Imperial Court Banker by 1786. \nAlso in 1782, Simon Synger\u2014a descendant of Koppel Frankel and the Austrian Mint Jews\u2014married Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s daughter. The same year, Frankfurt <italic>Stern</italic> banker Samuel Stern\u2014a descendant of the Kanns and an extended Oppenheim and Wertheim cousin\u2014married Sarah Kulp, a Katz-cousin and third cousin of Michael Speyer. A year after the son of Salomon and Sprinz Levy of Prussia married his first cousin once removed, Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s daughter, in 1783, Prussia extended some Jewish freedoms in 1784, and the Prussian Levys received the rights of Christian Court factors.\nBut French and Swiss interests faced another threat. Treaties between 1727 and 1731 had dissolved Austria\u2019s East Indies trade out of Ostend under Anglo-Dutch pressure. As alliances shifted, former EIC employee Willem Bolts joined and Antwerp banker Charles Proli\u2014who had inherited <italic>Proli</italic> bank from his widowed mother\u2014to form <italic>Ostend</italic><italic> Co</italic> and renew the trade in 1775. After establishing factories through 1778, wars between Mysore and the British disrupted operations. Losing <italic>Ostend</italic>, <italic>Proli</italic> liquidated by the early 1780s.\nAfter France, Britain, and America ended the war with the <italic>T</italic><italic>reaty </italic><italic>of Paris</italic> in 1783\u2014for which free-trade promoting Pierre DuPont was ennobled\u2014Britain received the Sultan of Kedah\u2019s Penang Island, soon forcing the Dutch out of Malacca. Sensing a split between Britian and the Dutch during the war, Habsburg Court Banker Barbe Nettine\u2019s grandson Edouard Walckiers started <italic>Banque Particuli\u00e8re</italic> in Ostend, Austrian Belgium, with former <italic>Coutts</italic> Managing Partner Robert Herries and his countryman Walter Boyd. <italic>Particuli\u00e8re</italic> invested in <italic>Nettine</italic>, which contracted a ship for the Angola slave trade. \nEstablishing <italic>Belgium </italic><italic>Assurance </italic>in 1782, <italic>Particuli\u00e8re</italic> expanded to Brussels, Ostend, Ghent, and Bruges by 1783. Walckiers became the Belgian Receiver General of Finance in 1784 and worked with <italic>Ezechiels</italic> of Rotterdam for two years. After briefly serving in Parliament, Herries expanded into colonial maritime insurance and privateering with <italic>Herries Keith</italic> out of Ostend. In 1784, Herries appointed his brother to lead <italic>Herries</italic>, with James Drummond joining as a partner. \nWithin a year, <italic>Herries</italic> became London intermediary and maritime insurer for <italic>Indes</italic>. For tobacco contracts, <italic>Herries</italic> collaborated with <italic>Boyd Ker</italic> as Boyd split to co-found a Parisian correspondent. Working with <italic>Hope</italic> and <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Boyd</italic> <italic>Ker</italic> failed to monopolize cochineal dye in 1787. Along with servicing American Minister Thomas Jefferson, <italic>Boyd Ker</italic> acted as Herries\u2019 agent in bidding for a contract to supply Virginia tobacco to France.\nAlong with holding <italic>Indes</italic> stock, <italic>Lamb</italic> Head Jean Lamb became a director of <italic>Caisse d\u2019Escompte </italic>until selling <italic>Lamb</italic> to a Dutch refugee banker. Likewise, Swiss Huguenot bankers returned to Paris to fund <italic>Indes</italic> and other trade. Among the oldest was started by the Rougemonts, who received the hereditary viscountship of Besan\u00e7on in 1030, where they produced three archbishops and were granted nobility in 1683. Since trader Fran\u00e7ois Rougemont declined Prussian ennoblement, his son Jean-Jacques founded a Parisian banking house. \nAs Rougemont partnered with Jean-Conrad Hottinguer<italic> </italic>to form <italic>Rougemont Hottinguer</italic> with several other patricians, they hired Henri Escher, whose father formed a bank by 1787. But although Louis XVI allowed Huguenots to live in France, follow any profession, and marry before civil justices, the French <italic>Treasury </italic>dwindled. As Swiss bankruptcies spread, Jean Escher shuttered his bank and joined the Russian military. \nAt the same time, Russian Court Banker <italic>Friedrichs</italic> organized more loans from <italic>DeSmeth</italic>, driven partly by the political unrest in Holland and unsuccessful attempts to secure loans from Britain. By 1783, Catherine awarded Ukrainian Moshe Pernas\u2014possibly a Sephardi shipbuilder\u2014with the surname <italic>Rafalovich</italic>. His descendants dominated Russian grain. \nBritish merchant bankers, such as the evangelical Anglican <italic>Thornton</italic>, also lived in Russia and kinterlinked with descendants of Tsar Peter\u2019s English shipbuilders, <italic>Wilberforce</italic> Baltic traders, and <italic>Smyth</italic> bankers. By 1784, the cousins established Baltic merchants <italic>Wilberforce</italic> <italic>Smyth</italic>. (As a Thornton wed a metal merchant\u2019s daughter, a Smyth married merchant William Manning, the son of a Saint-Kitts planter who settled in London in the 1760s. William\u2019s sister had married Huguenot slave trader Henry Laurens\u2019 son, <italic>Oswald</italic>\u2019s partner in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1776.)\nGrigory Potemkin was born in a village near Smolensk. His family owned a modest estate with 430 male serfs and claimed descent from Italian and Dalmatian princes. Catherine II noticed Potemkin for his wit in 1762 and made him her lover during her rise to power. After their affair ended, he remained her trusted advisor and de facto co-ruler. Potemkin founded the Black Sea Fleet and the cities of Sebastopol and Odessa, annexed Crimea, and led Russia to victory in the <italic>Russo-Turkish War</italic> (1768-1774).\nIn 1772, the First Partition of Poland incorporated approximately 45,000 Jews into the Russian Empire. In 1776, Tsarina Catherine awarded the Krichev district to Prince Potemkin and granted the Shklov district to another lover, General Semion Zorich. Both men managed these estates and interacted with local Jews. Inviting Jewish settlers to move to southern Russia, Potemkin permitted Jews to settle in areas left vacant by the Cossacks in 1777, provided they brought Christian Poles and invested capital. \nPotemkin offered them seven years of tax exemption, permission to trade in wines and spirits, and protection from soldiers. From 1780, Russia opened fifteen note-issuing branch banks, mainly in newly annexed areas. More generally, Russia sought to economically integrate Jews, allowing them to engage banking and trade with the same taxes as Christians.\nAs his brother became Zorich\u2019s import-export agent in Riga, Shklov-born Joshua Zeitlin, a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, managed Potemkin\u2019s, organized military supplies, and ran the mint at Kaffa in Crimea. Zeitlin, who frequently traveled with Potemkin, was made a Court Advisor, thereby allowing him to be a noble status and own the Mordvinov estates with 910 serfs. A promoter of Haskalah against Hasidism, Zeitlin maintained connections with the Wilna Gaon and Moses Mendelssohn, and his daughter married the Chief Rabbi of Berlin\u2019s Katz-descendant nephew, Abram Peretz. Zorich\u2019s contractor Mogilev-born merchant Natan Nota served Polish Lords before moving to Shklov and supplying Potemkin. Later serving Zorich, Nota wed the daughter of the Katz-descendant Rabbi of Metz.\nFor international finance, Prince Potemkin depended upon Richard Sutherland, a third generation Russian-Scot shipbuilder affiliated with <italic>Russia Co</italic>, was instrumental in managing finances. Sutherland facilitated significant financial transactions, including arranging a loan in 1784 to support Potemkin\u2019s colonization efforts of Mennonites from Danzig to New Russia. He also funded infrastructure, such as the construction of the town of Ekaterinoslav. Throughout their financial dealings, Sutherland faced challenges due to Potemkin\u2019s erratic borrowing patterns and frequent defaults.\nBy 1784, Russia Catherine annexed the Crimea of the Ottoman-allied Giray Khanate. With the death of <italic>Friedrichs</italic>, Tsarina Catherine appointed Sutherland the Court Banker. While Russia consolidated her note issuing banks and printed more notes, rumors about Sutherland spread in 1786, leading <italic>DeSmeth</italic> and other banks to decline his drafts. Although Russian initially negotiated with the Dutch and Danish for troop transport ships, British <italic>Thornton</italic> became the primary supplier. \nBut as <italic>Thornton</italic> neared delivery, Spanish and French influences led the government to intervene and halted the transaction. As Sweden sought to regain Courland, she allied with Turkey, and invaded Russia in 1788. While <italic>Hope</italic> extended credit to Sutherland and bought Russian commodities, Catherine made Sutherland a baron. Chief bankers to several Grand Viziers, the Armenian Serpos family arranged the transfer of the Ottoman subsidy to Sweden, via Hamburg.\nLike for Huguenots, France eased exclusions on Jews from guilds and allowed some to open shops from 1787. While creditors opposed bankruptcy, Louis XVI convened the Estates General for the first since 1615 to levy taxes in 1789. As Necker was against using military force to suppress the protests that followed, Louis XVI dismissed him. This move signaled the Crown\u2019s unwillingness to address the concerns of the people, leading Parisians to storm the Bastille debt prison. In response to popular demand, Louis XVI reinstated Necker, who increasingly borrowed from <italic>Indes</italic>, the clergy, and the Swiss. \nElected a deputy of the Estates General alongside Court Banker Jean-Joseph Laborde\u2019s son Fran\u00e7ois and ennobled Bureau of Finances official Pierre DuPont, Huguenot banker and guild member of Strasbourg Jean T\u00fcrckheim proposed an exception for Alsace during the debate over the abolition of seigneurial rights. The king approved this request to protect the feudal privileges of foreign princes, ensuring that these rights would not be abolished without compensation. After Jean\u2019s brother Bernard was elected municipal officer in 1790, fellow Huguenot and the forge master Frederic Dietrich became the first elected Mayor of Strasbourg.\nAs the revolutionary <italic>Assembly</italic> legislature ascended power, she legalized usury and abolished debt prisons, monopolies, and unions. However, she re-established debt prisons after commerce destabilized. Amid antisemitic unrest after the storming of the Bastille in 1782, Isaac Orchel led Lorraine\u2019s Jews in petitioning <italic>Assembly</italic> for equal rights. Orchel, however, sought to safeguard religious and national sentiments by including a provision for rabbis to retain their prerogatives over the Jewish populace, as per the previous regime. \nFollowing news of the Bastille\u2019s fall, rioters marched toward the local lord through the village of Uffholtz, where a fifth of the residents were Jewish. They launched an antisemitic pogrom, accusing the wealthiest resident, Samuel Manheimer, of usury. A grandson of former Zinswiller forge lessee Jacob Reichshoffer, Manheimer had married a daughter of the local Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9. As local authorities failed to intervene, Manheimer secured military protection. With the growth of the community, a rabbinical cousin of Isaac Aron of Phalsbourg soon settled there. Rioters also loitered Cerf Berr\u2019s granaries and vandalized his house and those of other Jews, Orchel participated in a delegation to Paris, advocating for equal civic rights for Jews. \nThe French Revolution of 1789 spurred Austria into action. In 1790, <italic>Kaulla</italic> received a contract from Bishop Maximilian Christoph of Constance and the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg to supply the Imperial Army in the Austrian Netherlands. By then, social reforms were well underway across the Empire. From 1772, Austria annexed Polish Galicia and imposed Austrian law. Reforms under Maria-Theresa and Joseph II included a 1775 directive limiting peasant labor to historical norms. Joseph II\u2019s 1782 decree set labor limits of three days per week for full peasants with animals and three days without for half peasants.\nSince Primator of Bohemian rural Jews Joachim Popper and Rabbi Ezekiel Landau established modern Jewish schools in Prague in 1781, Emperor Joseph II reinforced his grandfather Charles VI\u2019s restrictions on Jewish marriage, and forced locally regulated religious marriages to be civil contracts under state jurisdiction from 1783. Tensions grew as the state\u2019s civil definitions clashed with Jewish religious interpretations, resulting in jurisdictional disputes. \nAlthough Israel Popper H\u00f6nig converted like his siblings in the 1770s, he surrendered his tobacco monopoly in 1783 per Emperor Joseph II\u2019s wishes. He was then appointed as a councilor and tobacco director, cooperating with <italic>Fries</italic> and Nathan Arnstein to convert the former into the joint-stock <italic>Austrian State Tobacco Monopoly</italic> in 1788, altering trade dynamics among Bohemian rural Jews. By 1789, the Emperor granted H\u00f6nig the title of Austria\u2019s first non-baptized Jewish noble. \nIn Galicia, rather than work with guild-like kahals, Aryeh Bernstein imposed taxes and sold monopolies, including Brody merchant <italic>Nathansohn</italic>, whose son wed Bernstein\u2019s daughter. And as Jewish Galician kahals protested to Vienna, which replaced the Galician Chief Rabbinate with political administration from 1785.\nThe Edict of 1786 limited peasant labor and abolished serfdom in Galicia, with eased restrictions on marriage, industry, and trade. Inspired by Bohemian reforms, impact varied across regions, leading to peasant migration in some places. During Austria\u2019s war against Turkey in 1788, Rabbi Ezekiel Landau\u2019s son cooperated with the Emperor, endorsing reforms such as Jewish military service. In Galicia, the Edict of 1789 mandated all rabbis graduate from modern schools\u2014like the one\u2014within six years.\nWithout heirs, Popper partnered with his nephew to establish a bank in Prague, one of three alongside Frankel and widow Neustadtl in 1789. While the Emperor refused his ennoblement request, Popper led Austrian Jews in offering donations against the French. Popper soon became one of Prague\u2019s largest Jewish banks. Likewise Greek <italic>Devar</italic> opened a bank in Vienna in 1790, leading secular-oriented Greeks, Jews, and Armenians to influence Turkey to allow interest collection and debtor imprisonment. As <italic>Sina</italic> and other Balkan financiers embraced a cosmopolitan lifestyle through exogamous marriages and lent to Muslim landowners on secured mortgages, Balkan Greek merchants declined as businesses scaled and concentrated capital. \nSince engaging in timber, commission work, and shipowning connected to the West Indies and Southern States, the Quaker Rathbones of Liverpool refused to supply slave ships and partnered with co-religionist Robert Benson\u2014from a family of drapers and cotton traders\u2014to form <italic>Rathbone Benson</italic> and shifted the firm to trade with America in 1787.\nAs British promises of land and funds during America\u2019s <italic>Revolution</italic> went unfilled, Black loyalist homelessness grew. Joining abolitionists by 1790, British Blacks petitioned for a colony in Sierra Leone, away from Bahamian slave plantations and Canadian White competition. The Chair of <italic>Sierra Leone Co</italic> was Henry Thornton. The evangelical Anglican grandson of a BOE Regent and son of a merchant banker focused on the Russian trade, Henry joined his father\u2019s banking firm in 1780 and advocated for abolition with his second cousin, Member of Parliament William Bird Wilberforce, a merchant of Yorkshire whose aunt Mary Bird married Abel Smyth. \nAgreeing to grant land to establish Granville in Sierra Leone, King Naimbanna of Koya sent his sons to study in France and Britain. However, challenges arose with the onset of a severe rainy season and delays in supplies. While conflicts with local leaders led to the burning of Granville, settlers continued migrating. Thornton and Wilberforce had deep connections to the slave trade through the family. After the British evacuated Charlestown, South Carolina, in 1783, the Bird brothers, Henry and Robert\u2014Wilberforce\u2019s cousins and nephew-in-laws of Abel Smyth\u2014founded <italic>Bird Savage</italic> to supply Charleston commission house <italic>Smit DeSaussure Darrell</italic>. \nTo strengthen ties with Charleston, the Birds partnered with Benjamin Savage, a son of Charleston merchant John Savage, the son and grandson of Puritan Bermuda-based goldsmiths, was a descendant of Anne Hutchinson, daughter of Reverend Francis Marbury, and a cousin-in-law of Reverend Thomas Hooker. While Henry Bird married a sister of West Indies trader William Manning\u2014who had married Abel Smyth and Mary Bird\u2019s daughter Elizabeth \u2014the widowed John Savage married Manning\u2019s aunt in 1780.\nAfter Elizabeth Bird Smyth died in 1789, Manning remarried and became a BOE Regent and Commissioner by 1793. And since Smyth himself died in 1788, his son Robert led <italic>Smyth</italic> and funded the <italic>Exchequer</italic> and received a barony. Along with prospering in banking and trade, no fewer than 24 of Smyth\u2019s descendants sat at the <italic>House of Commons</italic> from 1770 to 1910 for a joint term of 364 years, without counting his family or in-laws. Indeed, along with Manning, Wilberforce, and Thornton, other Smyth in-laws and partners held decision making posts in Parliament and BOE.\nThe liberation spirit was infectious. In Britain, coal allowed Scottish foundries to reduce friction unlike charcoal. As the steam engine and card cylinders multiplied mining, metallurgic, and cotton efficiency, courts gave James Watt and Thomas Arkwright limited patent protection. With coal use spreading in the textiles industry, so did demand for coal and cotton from America\u2019s South. English collieries cartelized in 1785 and the Scots in 1790. \nWhile <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Barclay</italic> stopped thwarting Quaker attempts to abolish slavery,<italic> Barclay </italic>partner David Bevan married a daughter of a Jamaican London merchant in 1798. Since John Dawson of <italic>Baker Dawson</italic> became the largest British slave trader and banker after the <italic>American</italic> <italic>Revolution</italic>, his fortunes declined due to the <italic>French Revolution </italic>and abolitionist movements, eventually exiting the slave trade by the late 1790s.\nMetallurgy and related mining also spurred other banks across Britain. In 1791, Matthias Attwood and Isaac Spooner formed <italic>Attwood Spooner</italic>, becoming the fourth bank in Birmingham. Spooner\u2019s familial ties to the West Midlands date back to the 5th century, with his grandfather\u2019s investment in a Birmingham slitting mill in 1746. Concurrently, Owen Williams, a copper magnate of North Wales, established <italic>Chester Old Bank</italic>. Coal mining activities in Holywell prompted the creation of <italic>North Wales Bank</italic>, while the bank of <italic>Fendal Jelf</italic> emerged in South Wales in 1791, focusing on colliery ventures at Abergwm.\nWhile the banking partnership that started with <italic>Freame</italic> and grew with Barclay came to include Bevan\u2019s copper refining, <italic>London Lead Co</italic>, and other Quaker industries, Barclay bought <italic>Smyth</italic> out of a banking partnership in the 1770s, and <italic>Smyth</italic> branched to Lincoln and Hull by 1784, the latter a thriving port where Wilberforce and Thornton cousins long held political sway. The same year, a Thornton wed a metal merchant\u2019s daughter. But a new opportunity presented to Abel Smyth, then head of <italic>Smyth</italic>. Since Abel married Jane Beaumont in 1745, her nephew married the daughter of William Blackett as he died in 1792. The Beaumonts then inherited Blackett\u2019s Northumberland estate and one of Britain\u2019s largest lead deposits. \nFrance, meanwhile, continued to extend liberties to religious minorities. Since France eased exclusions on Huguenots and Jews from guilds and allowed some to open shops from 1787, Isaac Orchel participated in a delegation to Paris in 1789, advocating for equal civic rights for Jews. Soon after, Cerf Berr\u2019s apprentice, Lion Goudchaux\u2019s third grandnephew Lion Fould, moved to Paris. \nAs Lion Fould married an Oppenheim and Wertheim cousin Brillin, his brother married a Katz-descended third great niece of Glikl\u2019s Levy-Wimpfen husband and an extended Goudchaux and Oppenheim cousin. After establishing a bank in Paris with advanced from Cerf Berr, <italic>Fould </italic>hired Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s brother. Since discounted food during a famine of 1770, Goudchaux cousin-in-law and Lorraine merchant Hayem Worms married his son to a great-granddaughter of Lion Goudchaux, and settled in Paris by 1790, where he operated a hosiery business. \nAfter extending citizenship to the Sephardi of Bayonne and Bordeaux in 1790, <italic>Assembly</italic> did so for the Ashkenazi of Alsace and Lorraine in 1791. Marriages cemented bonds. In 1788, Isaac Orchel\u2019s daughter married Gar\u00e7on Gomperz Silny, a descendant of Lion Goudchaux\u2019s brother and wealthy Kohanim in Metz, who founded a trading and banking house in Nancy. Another of Orchel\u2019s daughters married Samuel, whose brother Wolff of Strasbourg was married to Cerf Beer\u2019s daughter and became a Court Jew in Bonn in 1789. Since Cerf Berr\u2019s niece wed David Aron of Phalsbourg in 1786, David\u2019s brother Jonas married Sara Cerf, a Katz and Speyer cousin, in 1791. Like Jews could enter cities, so could foreigners move to France. Among others, Abraham Lazard led his family from Bohemia to Lorraine. \nFollowing French emancipation of the Jews, Prussia made Daniel Itzig-Jaffe her first Jewish citizen in 1791, allowing him to live in Berlin without rabbinical oversight. The following year, Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s daughter married Mendel Oppenheim. Of unknown but likely relation to Samuel Oppenheim, Mendel\u2019s step-father S\u00fcskind began to trade grain, local products, commission work, forwarding, and collateral lending in Prussian K\u00f6nigsberg during the mid-18th century. While S\u00fcskind\u2019s daughter married a Friedl\u00e4nd, cousins of the Berliner Hirsch Magnus and in-laws of Veitel Ephraim and Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, his stepson Wolff Oppenheim succeeded him while his brother Mendel operated a banking firm in Berlin., Wolff married a descendant of Goldschmidt\u2019s brother, and their sister married a descendant of Samson Wertheim in 1796.\nLikewise, the Habsburg Empire ennobled three Wertheim brothers starting in 1791. More than Josef Wertheim\u2019s late dealings with Bavaria, the ennoblements stemmed from their family\u2019s century of contribution since their grandfather Samson Wertheim. As the Emperor reappointed Amschel Goldschmidt Imperial Court Jew, he also promoted Protective Jew of the Imperial City of M\u00fchlhausen-Ph\u00fcringen and Abraham Oppenheim to Imperial Court Jews. While Nathan Arnstein was an Imperial Court Jew, his Catholic brother was ennobled with a barony.\nWhile elites Jews feared emancipation would lead to assimilation, loss of rabbinical autonomy and their special status, Christian Alsatians argued for rights to Jews as individuals, but not a class. As French revolutionaries<italic> </italic>turned against religion, <italic>Assembly</italic> expropriated churches to collateralize <italic>assignat </italic>notes. Strasbourg\u2019s Procurator not only closed synagogues but burned religious texts. Falling property sales and growing expenses led <italic>Assembly</italic> to print <italic>assignats</italic>. \nAs France pulled in hard currency against<italic> assignat</italic> inflation, <italic>Bank of Hamburg</italic> eliminated coin deposits in favor of silver bullion\u2014and its liabilities circulated as \u2018<italic>virtual coins</italic>\u2019 in 1790. The same year, <italic>Rougemont Hottinguer</italic> split. While <italic>Hottinguer</italic> shifted to importing commodities, <italic>Rougemont</italic> brought in his nephews. Likewise, <italic>Boyd Ker</italic> added Edouard Walckiers\u2019 cousin\u2014Fran\u00e7ois Laborde, son of the French Court Banker Jean-Joseph Laborde\u2014as a partner and speculated on <italic>assignats</italic> and commodities.\nSince French women had held leadership roles through inheritance or military service for centuries, the <italic>Declaration of the Rights of Man & of the Citizen</italic> in 1789 did not address their political status. As the <italic>Declaration of Rights</italic> extended the vote to poor Whites and free Blacks in Saint-Domingue, David Gradis supported these demands even before Jewish representation was considered, but restlessness spread across <italic>Indes\u2019</italic> colony. While 88% of Saint-Domingue was enslaved, free Whites and non-Whites split the rest. As poor Whites protested high interest rates, they criticized the Governor for not applying laws that discriminated against non-Whites. By 1790, <italic>Assembly</italic> extended civil and political rights to Huguenots, while radical Whites in the Colonial Assembly of Saint-Marc sought to limit the influence of free Blacks.\nSo, the Governor used royal troops and free colored militiamen to shut the Colonial Assembly. While the Parisian legislature denied the White bid for autonomy, Spain helped Toussaint Louverture lead free and slave mulattos in a revolt, and British forces blocked French ships and invaded. Because he exported cloth to Saint-Domingue and imported sugar to refine in Marseille, Claude P\u00e9rier suffered significant losses, which were alleviated by his repayment of debts in <italic>assignats</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Boyd Ker</italic><italic> </italic>profited as sugar prices surged, Spain allowed British merchants to trade Caribbean sugar. Having arrived in Spanish Louisiana in 1781, Basque Jean Echevarria owned a Mississippi River plantation established by a slave running Basque, became New Orleans\u2019s first banker, serving as the public prosecutor of New Orleans from 1794 and then city treasurer. \nWith the transition to electoral systems, <italic>Assembly</italic>\u2019s <italic>Constitution</italic> of 1791 denied women the right to vote or hold office. And with popular French liberties, came belligerence. By April 1792, <italic>Assembly</italic> declared war on Austria, which in turn had allied with Prussia and other powers and invaded French Lille from Austrian Belgium.  Soon after, French General Custine took three prominent Frankfurters hostage in 1792 to ensure payment of a war tax, including Isaac, brother of the Imperial Court Banker Michael Speyer. \nAs debt imprisonment increased, French revolutionaries freed debtors, leading to the overthrow of Louis XVI when the <italic>Convention</italic> seized power and replaced <italic>Assembly</italic> in August 1792. As <italic>assignats</italic> depreciated, Swiss bankers collapsed. While Hottinguer faced criticism for trading <italic>assignats</italic> and Rougemont retired, <italic>Convention</italic> regime executed King Louis XVI and his wife Marie-Antoinette, daughter of the Habsburg Empress Maria-Theresa, after a trial. After <italic>Convention</italic> abolished debt prisons and primogeniture in March 1793, they forced <italic>assignats</italic> on the wealthy in May and abolished slavery by 1794. \nHaving led a militia to defend the King, Pierre DuPont was sentenced to die but a prison mix-up saved his life. Accused of being royalists, Conrad Hottinguer liquidated <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, and fled the country with his assistant Henri Escher. Amidst this chaos, Jews kinterlinked. While Hayem Worms\u2019 daughter married Jacob Silny\u2014whose brother Gar\u00e7on had married Isaac Orchel\u2019s daughter in 1788\u2014Guelch\u00e9 Cahen\u2014a descendant of Elias Gomperz, Glikl and Joseph Goldschmidt, Lion Halphen Goudchaux, and Aisik Orchel\u2014married the Chief Rabbi of Metz Joseph Guggenheim\u2019s son, who received a certificate of emigration and served in the national guard from that year. \nWhile the Head of <italic>Dietrich</italic> and Mayor of Strasbourg Frederic Dietrich supported the <italic>Revolution</italic>\u2014Rouget l\u2019Isle composed the <italic>Marseillaise</italic> in his house\u2014he opposed the Reign of Terror. By late 1792 he was replaced with banker Bernard T\u00fcrckheim as Mayor of Strasbourg. However, as revolutionaries deposed him several weeks later, T\u00fcrckheim fled to Germany with his family. In Strasbourg, the revolutionaries soon guillotined Dietrich and seized his factories. Likewise Ignace Wendel\u2019s mother was imprisoned during the <italic>French Revolution</italic>, Ignace was forced into exile. He committed suicide as his family\u2019s assets were nationalized and his nephew was guillotined. Although his mother was released in 1795, she died in 1802, destitute at 82. \nBy October 1793, <italic>Convention</italic> arrested Gar\u00e7on Silny suspecting that he bought silver to smuggle abroad for wealthy Jews. Likewise, Netter, Worms, and Lazard were imprisoned for profiteering and Rabbi Joseph Guggenheim for his son\u2019s \u2018pre-emigration.\u2019 After imprisonment by Strasbourg\u2019s new mayor in late 1793, Cerf Berr died sixteen days later. Within months Berr\u2019s grandson converted to Christianity and volunteered for the military in 1794. \nThat year, revolutionaries guillotined former French Court Banker and Barbe Nettine\u2019s son-in-law Jean-Joseph Laborde, his Court banker cousin, and a <italic>Boyd Ker</italic><italic> </italic>partner. Two nephews of Prague banker Popper met a similar fate. Along with Catholic aristocrats, Huguenot Paul Cazenove and his two sons, Jean and Charles, were imprisoned, while his wife was held under guard. They were condemned to death but were spared when <italic>Convention</italic> fell from power in 1795, allowing Charles and others to flee to America. \nSince financing <italic>Creusot</italic>, Claude P\u00e9rier closed his bank and was imprisoned in 1793 and freed by his son-in-law. His brother committed suicide in custody, and his widow was murdered. In 1794, P\u00e9rier established a factory to produce arms for the government and paid a forced loan. He later acquired a significant stake in <italic>Anzin</italic>, France\u2019s largest enterprise.\nIn 1789, Catherine II captured more Turkish Ukraine but continued banning Jews from living in urban areas. However, increasing note issuance and international destabilization resulted in the disappearance of specie from Moscow and Russia\u2019s interior. As only merchants could write bills of exchange since 1729, royals were forced to use merchant credit, but themselves were not subject to bankruptcy. This left Sutherland and other Court merchants with a lot of debt, chronic non-payment, and limited legal recourse. \nSutherland was affected by excessive borrowing Prince Potemkin, her former lover. Through the Summer of 1791, Russian courtier complaints over Sutherland\u2019s misuse of funds reached Catherine, leading to an investigation. After Potemkin\u2019s and Sutherland\u2019s deaths in October 1791, investigations revealed Sutherland\u2019s misappropriations and debts to officials like Prince Viazemskii and Grand Duke Paul. After banning the export of Russian metallic money, Catherine oversaw the establishment of the <italic>Pale of Settlement</italic>, forcing Jews to require special permission to leave the pre-1772 Polish lands from the Baltic through Ukraine.\nUnlike Austria, <italic>Blanc</italic> and other Christian bankers led Poland\u2019s tobacco monopoly in 1784, issuing paper money for financing. Fearing Russian invasion, Poland had entered a treaty with Prussia in 1790. In reaction to the <italic>French Revolution</italic>, Poland enacted a constitution in 1791, maintaining serfdom unlike Galicia while taxing the nobility and clergy. That year, Poland ennobled over a dozen kinterlinked, Christian bankers led by <italic>Tepper</italic> and <italic>Blanc</italic>. These bankers had depended on Dutch capital\u2014mostly Christians aside from <italic>Boas</italic>\u2014to finance Poland their operations. However, the constitution prompted a Radziwill cousin and other Lords to seek Russia\u2019s intervention to restore the former Polish constitution.\nWhile the Dutch appointed had appointed Joachim Boas\u2014a cousin of the Goldschmidt, Cohen-Barent, and Symons families and in-law of a Wertheim\u2014a Court Banker in 1792, the Polish crisis but disrupted the family. Marcus Boas and Elias Lima failed first, pulling down Abraham and Simeon Boas. The Court of Holland granted their request to suspend payments in November, along with Moses Boas, Abraham Ephraim, Salomon Goldschmit, and others. Some received a three-month extension after settling with creditors, while the suspension became permanent in late December for the Boas and Lima. While the disgraced Boas died, much remained unpaid for decades.\nAs Prussia sent troops into Poland per the 1790 treaty, the two powers agreed to the Second Partition in January 1793. Within days, <italic>Tepper</italic>\u2019s creditors arrived in Warsaw to register securities following rumors of his financial difficulties, and the public announcement of the bankers\u2019 bankruptcy caused panic, bringing down <italic>Blanc</italic> and other Christian Warsaw banks. After Russian troops forced the Polish Parliament to agree to the Partition, Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko staged the <italic>Uprising of 1794</italic>, promising reduced labor and tenure for peasants and issuing paper money for financing. \nSuppressing the rebellion, Russia and Prussia split what remained of Poland with Austria in 1795. In the land won from Turkey, Catherine II chartered Odessa into a naval port, an international city within the <italic>Pale</italic>, designed by an Italian and populated by Albanians, Greeks, and other foreigners. Catherine died after invading Persia in 1796, pausing Odessa\u2019s development.\nIn Holland, by then, Willem Borski came from a long line of Dutch Protestant brewers who had served in the city council. In 1789, he ventured into commodity brokering and married Johanna Velde, the possibly Mennonite daughter of a flax merchant. When the French revolutionary armies occupied Holland in 1794, Henry Hope fled to London with his movable assets, leaving his underwriter to manage the affairs of <italic>Hope</italic>. \nHenry Baring, Alex\u2019s younger brother, was already in Philadelphia visiting William Bingham. With the Hopes settled in London, there was a need for suitable investments for the capital withdrawn from Holland. As Baring bought land from Bingham, both Alex and Henry married Bingham\u2019s daughters. \nFollowing the fall of Holland in 1795, trade moved to Hamburg and deposits to <italic>Bank of Hamburg</italic>. Likewise, Goldsmid-in-laws Prager of London closed their Dutch branch and sent their merchandize to Hamburg. As Holland became a French vassal state in 1795, Catholics gained political rights. While Jews achieved legal equality in 1796, those in Cura\u00e7ao waited for decades along with Black slaves for their emancipation. During this time, Borski diversified his business to become the largest commission trader in foreign securities, acting as the key Dutch agent for Russian loans from <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Hope</italic>. \nFellow Christian banker <italic>DeSmeth </italic>reinforced kinterlinks with spinning textiles operators in Ghent in 1792 and 1797. Although Frankfurt prohibited him from starting a joint-stock bank in 1790\u2014and continued to do so for decades\u2014Lutheran German merchant bankers like <italic>Metzler</italic> of Frankfurt expanded into Catholic countries, with branches in Bordeaux and Vienna. Friedrich Metzler served as personal banker for King Ferdinand IV of Sicily, Maria-Theresa\u2019s son-in-law.\nSince Cerf Berr died in 1793, his sons partnered with Daniel Itzig-Jaffe to supply ten thousand horses to the French army. While <italic>Boyd Ker</italic> in Paris collapsed in 1793 before a partner was guillotined, Edouard Walckiers and Robert Herries remained in business. But with French forces clashing with Austria and occupying Belgium, Walckiers fled to Hamburg in 1794 to evade an arrest warrant issued by <italic>Convention</italic>. From Hamburg, Walckiers leveraged his family\u2019s connections in Brussels to supply the French army with grain and provisions, both to regain favor and to profit from the poor French harvests. However, his efforts were soon undercut by competitor Jean-Baptiste Paul\u00e9e. \nSince the Bavarian Elector appointed David Oppenheim of Mannheim as Court War Factor in 1785, Markus Oppenheim of Frankfurt became Electoral Palatinate-Bavarian Court Factor in 1791. Likewise, the Oppenheims reinforced bonds with Austro-German Court Jews. Possibly a relative of Joseph-S\u00fcss Oppenheim, Breslau-born Salomon Haber married a Baden Court Jew heiress, and became Court Jew of Baden by 1794. \nSince Julie Weisweiller Goldschmidt, Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s third great-granddaughter, married Isaac Landauer, a Brillin Oppenheim descendant and possibly a Landau cousin, in 1793, Mayer Rothschild\u2019s daughter married Oppenheim and Orchel cousin Benedict d\u2019Worms in 1795, and Rothschild funded Austrian campaigns against France with his extended cousin Nehm Oppenheim Rindskopf of Frankfurt, whose daughter soon married a Goldschmidt as Napoleon invaded Frankfurt in 1796, destroying the ghetto. \nWhile French <italic>assignats</italic> inflated in the 1790s, <italic>Directory</italic> replaced <italic>Convention </italic>in 1795. As Walckiers petitioned for payment in December 1795, but months of delays led to his bankruptcy in May 1796. He later took a clerk position and died in obscurity. Also in late 1795, Cerf Berr\u2019s sons refused to accept <italic>assignats</italic> and loan money to Napoleon, they were forced to liquidate their company in 1796, which led to Itzig-Jaffe's bankruptcy. Both families faced financial ruin, but Itzig-Jaffe retained some reputation. As Itzig-Jaffe died in 1799, most of his sons fell into insolvency. But his daughters and trainee Joseph Mendelssohn, Moses\u2019 son, thrived.\nAs the Mughal Empire continued to crumble, the British advanced. Warring with Mysore in the south from 1780, EIC borrowed funds from banker Kashmiri Mai of Benares in the north. Likewise, branching to Cuttack and Madras, the Das family of Benares bought EIC paper during Mysore wars through 1790. In Surat, in the west, Hindu and Jain castes specializing in commercial activities were led by seths. \nWhile the Jain Jagat Seths recovered from short term crunches due to war, they declined with the rising competition of Hindu commercial castes as regional regimes consolidated and favored merchant-bankers with close ties to emerging dynasties. As Hindus gained power in the trading and financial system of Surat, tensions with the Muslim ruling elite and artisans culminated in the Surat riots of 1795. However, as British bankers grew, Benares\u2019 banking influence declined by the early 19th century, some of the Das family shifted to landholding.\nAs Napoleon invaded Italy in 1797, central banks collapsed in Genoa and Venice, and the rush to silver drove a premium on Austria\u2019s paper money. Napoleon gained from Genoa\u2019s loss. Since fleeing France in 1667, Andre established a dynasty of Huguenot bankers in Genoa. Initially focused on trade, Andre left Genoa after French invasion in 1797 for Paris by 1800. He began investing into government loans and industry. (In 1847, <italic>Andre</italic> kinterlinked with the Neuflize family. Descended from cloth manufactures ennobled by Louis XV, Neuflizes heirs eventually took over <italic>Andre</italic> and renamed her <italic>Neuflize</italic>.)\nWithout Italy, Austria depended on Bohemia. Since the deaths of Landau, Popper, Emperor Joseph, and his brother Leo II, Austria revised the 1781 law only with the <italic>Edict of Toleration of 1797</italic> for Bohemian Jews. With the same law, Austria eliminated the rabbinic judiciary by prohibiting excommunication and mandating a secular education for rabbis\u2014in the school Landau and Popper had established in 1781\u2014like the Galician law of 1789. In France, Cerf Berr\u2019s grandson converted in 1794 and became the first general of Jewish origin during the First French Empire. While Berr\u2019s son married Isaac Orchel\u2019s daughter in 1800, Berr\u2019s brother-in-law Rabbi David Sinzheim became first Grand Rabbi of the <italic>Consistory of Paris</italic>. Kinterlinking with French-allied Bavarian Jews, Isaac Orchel\u2019s niece married a Seligmann by 1803.\nSince Jonas Aron of Phalsbourg married Katz-cousin Sara Cerf in 1791, brothers Jacob and Gar\u00e7on Silny wed their cousin Isaac Orchel\u2019s daughter in 1788 and Parisian hosiery merchant Hayem Worms in 1793, who became deputy mayor in 1799. Their families joined the war effort. Aaron Lazard rose to artillery sergeant major, his brother, Mayer, served in Saint-Domingue. While one of Isaac Orchel\u2019s brothers became a major, another was a member of the Legion of Honor. As Michel Goudchaux became first midshipman class, his brother made lieutenant. Similarly, Louis Mayer Marx was a wagon corps officer. Like Louis Aron\u2014son of a Pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 of Phalsbourg and son-in-law of Michel Orchel Wolff\u2014Louis Goudchaux became indigent over the following decade, surviving only through charity, and deriving glory from the military bravery of his sons and cousin.\nAfter Turkish closed ports to stop the spread of Republican ideals, <italic>Sina</italic> and other Armenians continued trading using caravans and expanded into Bosnia. As Austrian bank notes hyperinflated, <italic>Sina</italic> sold Turkish cotton and wool into Vienna during the naval blockades for metal currency and invest in cheap properties. And in Hungary, another Court Jew family thrived. While Samuel Oppenheim relied on extended Gunzburg cousin Samuel Ulman as Court Jew of Bavaria, some of Ulman\u2019s descendants branched to Frankfurt, Augsburg, F\u00fcrth, and elsewhere, Ulmans became rabbis and kinterlinked with other prominent families. In Austrian Hungary, Mor, a son of one rabbinical Ulman and a Schlesinger, migrated to Pest, where he married a Hirschel and became a trader of grain, wool, salt, and leather. Likewise, Mor\u2019s cousin-once removed married the son of a Schlesinger and descendant of the Mandl Prefects of Hungarian Jews.\nJews also linked trade Austrian through key trade routes. In Hungary, Fej\u00e9r served as a key meeting point for merchants traveling between Vienna, Zagreb, Transdanubia, and Transylvania. In the 18th century, local landowners invited Jewish settlers. While most came from Moravia, the Baumgarten family arrived from W\u00fcrttemberg during Empress Maria-Theresa\u2019s reign and settled in Fej\u00e9r. Israel Baumgarten soon became a merchant in grain and wool and served as Parnas of the community.\nBy the 1780s, Samuel Zbytkower was supplying military goods, including grain, fodder, and horses, to the Polish, Russian, and other foreign armies. In 1788, he was appointed Parnas of the Warsaw suburb of Praga. He leased villages, held liquor concessions, and expanded into the leather industry, establishing a large tannery in Praga by 1790. Before Glogau withdrew to London, Zbytkower\u2019s daughter married Isaac Flatau of Polish Flatow, which was annexed by Prussia in 1772. Both families also kinterlinked with Leib Oesterreicher of Brody and together traded in obligations and provided credit. Zbytkower began banking out of Warsaw in 1795. As Zbytkower\u2019s son, Berek, wed the wealthy Temerel Horowitz of Opoczno in 1787, King Stanislaw August attended their wedding. \nWhile Christian bankers grew under King August, most had failed after 1792. Soon, Zbytkower, Leyzer Dillon\u2014son of the Neswisch Radziwill Court Jew\u2014, Samuel Epstein\u2014Luria descendant and son of Rabbi of K\u00f6nigsberg\u2014, and other Court Jew descendants served as military purveyors for Russia. Likewise, Katz-descendant Jonas Frankel left Berlin to bank Breslau, his non-Katz-descended cousin and fellow Goldschmidt cousin, Samuel, a nephew of Sprinz Levy and grandnephew of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, moved to Warsaw. \nIn 1794, Jacob Beer obtained contracts to supply Prussian troops in Poland. Born in Oder to a great grandson of Johann and Esther Liebman, as well as a member of the Oppenheim, Meisel, and Luria Katz families, he married the daughter of Liepmann Walf, the richest Jew in Berlin, securing a general trading permit. Walf, the third great-nephew of Koppel Frankel and a descendant of the Schlesinger family, among Vienna's earliest Jews, was married to a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe. But as Prussia\u2019s <italic>Edict of 1797</italic> permitted more occupations for Jews for her new Polish lands, she curtailed religious and political rights. \nSince Aaron Goldsmid\u2019s son Asher married his extended cousin Keyser at <italic>Mocatta </italic>in 1770, he joined <italic>Mocatta </italic>in 1787. That year, Nathaniel Rapha\u00ebl, one of the first Jews to hold a Dutch municipal office, founded <italic>Rapha\u00ebl </italic>to refine gold and silver in London. Like the Goldsmids Pressburger, a grandson of Merle Schiff Wertheim and Isaac Liebman, whose Arnstein cousin kinterlinked with the Austrian Duschenes Popper family in the 1780s, <italic>Mocatta</italic>\u2019s Aberbanel descendant cousin married a descendant of Prague Court Jew Jacob Bassevi in 1791. By 1792, <italic>Goldsmid</italic> began to broker <italic>Exchequer</italic> debt, and soon led that market. By 1795, <italic>Goldsmid</italic> joined the first syndication of <italic>Exchequer</italic> government loans with <italic>Thellusson</italic>, <italic>Robarts</italic>, and <italic>Byrd</italic>.\nLondon bank <italic>Curtis</italic> <italic>Were</italic> <italic>Robarts </italic>(\u201c<italic>Robarts</italic>\u201d) also organized in 1792. While the Weres has kinterlinked with other Quaker bankers, Curtis and Robarts linked to politics. Back in 1749, Mary Were married George Fox, whose son wed Catherine Young in 1780, connected to the Darby ironmasters and the Bevans. William Curtis was born into a Presbyterian family of ships\u2019 biscuit makers who expanded into whale fisheries, East Indies shipping, and government contracting. \nIn 1783, Curtis joined <italic>Drapers\u2019 Co</italic> and served as Alderman of Tower Ward in 1785, Sheriff of London from 1788 to 1789 and MP for London from 1790 for nearly four decades, and London\u2019s coal meter in 1791. While Curtis was Tory leader, Abraham Robarts was a Whig and wed the sister of George Tierney, MP and Whig leader, and became a West Indies factor and a director of <italic>Royal Assurance</italic>, EIC, and Lechmere\u2019s bank at Worcester in the 1780s.\nSince London-born Huguenot Peter Thellusson\u2014whose grandfather Isaac had advised the French Regent during the <italic>Panic of 1720</italic>\u2014married a BOE Director\u2019s daughter and joined the Court of BOE in 1787, he became an MP from 1795, and his brother wed the daughter of Robarts, who too became an MP and worked closely with his brother-in-law Tierney. Likewise, Curtis was Mayor of London. However, rumors of invasion in late 1797 started bank runs, leading BOE to suspend <italic>pound</italic> gold payouts while continuing to discount trade bills payable in London (\u201cMMBU\u201d)\u2014allowing banks to multiply\u2014while Parliament repealed the <italic>Act of 1732</italic>. With the monetization of credit contracts gold, <italic>scriveners</italic>\u2014who had drawn legal money contracts in competition with goldsmiths\u2014stated many of the banks.\nWith the suspension of cash payments, <italic>Glyn </italic>and other bankers opened deposit accounts with BOE to enable payments. Ceasing note issuance and discounting, <italic>Touche</italic> of Dublin invested in ironworks and canals. However, some colonial trade banks suffered. As <italic>Herries </italic>went bankrupt, Robert Herries retired, and Thomas Farquhar, a descendant of King James V and extended cousin of the Drummonds, took over what became <italic>Herries Farquhar</italic>. Moreover, BOE\u2019s suspension strengthened <italic>Bank of Hamburg</italic>\u2019s virtual silver coins relative to the <italic>pound</italic>. The inflow of capital into Hamburg stimulated trade, particularly Virginian tobacco, which tripled in price.\n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Revolutions of the 18</italic><italic>th</italic><italic> Century</italic><italic> </italic><italic>\u2013 Part II</italic>\nBOE\u2019s suspension strengthened <italic>Bank of Hamburg</italic>\u2019s virtual silver coins relative to the <italic>pound</italic>. The inflow of capital into Hamburg stimulated trade, particularly Virginian tobacco, which tripled in price.\nSo, families restructured alliances. Since their cousin Symons bankrupted in 1792, Frankfurter Levin Glogau\u2019s son, Moses, moved from Amsterdam to London and their cousin wed Martin Heckscher, related to the Warburg and delBanco descendants of Paderborn\u2019s Protected Jews. By 1797, another Glogau married the Saxon Court Jewess Philippine Kaskele\u2019s son Michael. As Michael continued to work with their mother in Dresden, broadening imports to include silver, copper, and colonial goods for textile exports, his brothers branched to Leipzig. The Kaskels also kinterlinked with Popper H\u00f6nig family of Prague.\nWith connections to Warburg, Hamburg merchant Moses Melchior\u2014whose second great aunt married a Katz Wahl descendant and sister married a Heckscher of Altona\u2014founded <italic>Melchior</italic> in Copenhagen in 1795. The same year, Warburg-cousin G\u00f6thilda delBanco Henriques married Lazarus Magnez, a Protected Jew of Gothenburg, Sweden, who established a colonial wholesale trading firm. \nSince marrying the daughter of Hamburg banker Marcus Heckscher, Gumprich delBanco Warburg bequeathed his Hamburg money-changing firm to his sons, who formed <italic>Warburg</italic> Hamburg to broker bills in 1798. Since Gumprich\u2019s nephew married Zipporah Henriques\u2014a descendant of Hamburg Parnas Haim F\u00fcrst and Spanish Court Jew Abraham Seneor-Coronel\u2014in 1796, Zipporah\u2019s brother Ruben started <italic>Henriques</italic> in Copenhagen in 1801 and, after the death of his wife, married Melchior\u2019s daughter. By 1804, Gumprich\u2019s great nephew founded <italic>Warburg</italic> Altona.\nSalomon Heine was another new Hamburger. Since Salomon\u2019s great-grandfather Isaak became a Court of Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe, Isaak\u2019s son David married Recha Gans, a descendant of Joseph Goldschmidt. Likewise, David\u2019s son Heymann married Recha\u2019s Gans niece. While Heymann\u2019s son Isaac moved to Bordeaux and built relations with Sephardim, another son married his extended cousin Betty Geldern, who descended from Joseph Goldschmidt, the Parnas of Geldern, and the Pressburger family. A third son, Salomon moved to Hamburg and began carrying bills of exchange. After married Betty Goldschmidt in 1794, he joined Martin Heckscher and his brothers-in-law, including Jacob Oppenheim of unknown lineage, in 1797, to establish a banking house that became <italic>Heine</italic>. \nAnd the year that Samson Wertheim\u2019s descendant Jakob Kann founded a bills and commissions business in Frankfurt in 1797, Hayum Goldschmidt, who descended from Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s uncle, married Gelchen Gans, a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, and started a currency trading business. Similarly, Mayer Rothschild\u2019s son, Nathan, left Frankfurt to apprentice in London\u2019s textile trade with <italic>Cohen-Barent</italic> and <italic>Goldsmid</italic> in 1798.\nGenerally, as wealthy Germans sought to protect their assets in Amsterdam and beyond, private banks distinct from trade arose. Since his father was a Protected Jew of Bonn, Salomon Seligmann Oppenheim established <italic>Oppenheim</italic> in Bonn by 1789. As Oppenheim became one of the first Jews to move to Cologne, his brother remained a merchant in Bonn and married Hanna, a daughter of the Katz descendant Chief Rabbi of Bonn, in 1798. \nAlso remaining in Bonn, Jonas Speyer Cahn\u2014a son of Bonn\u2019s Protected Jew\u2014opened <italic>Cahn</italic> bank in 1770, his nephew married Gutle Schnapper Rothschild\u2019s sister in 1798 and daughter wed Moises Cassel Zeligman\u2014a descendant of the Goldschmidt related Court Jews of Kassel and an in-law of the Parnas of Geldern, relatives of the Cah\u00e9n and Orchel families\u2014by 1800. By 1807, Jonas\u2019 son Heinrich married Hanna\u2019s sister, becoming Oppenheim\u2019s brother-in-law. And, since starting as a spice merchant in Bonn and marrying the Chief Rabbi of D\u00fcsseldorf\u2019s daughter, Mayer Geldern Cah\u00e9n transitioned into banking.\nWhile free trade Caribbean goods and Virginia tobacco inflated, winter storage rates in 1798 squeezed merchants in Hamburg. As the Hamburg import hub had strict bill discounting and bankruptcy laws, deflationary fire sales felled banks in the <italic>Panic of 1799</italic>, including Russo-German <italic>Mahs</italic>. By 1800, Caribbean bills discounts grew to 9% of BOE\u2019s portfolio, 1.5x that of trade bills. Parliament spurred free labor by outlawing Scottish life coal contracts. At the same time, she extended the trades for which death punished union strikes from 1720 to all British servants. \nAlthough Asher Goldsmid had worked for BOE\u2019s monopoly gold broker <italic>Mocatta</italic> since 1787, his cousin married a Mocatta in 1800 after BOE suspended cash payouts for <italic>pounds</italic>, and Asher\u2019s son became a partner, forming <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic> shortly after to broker gold. While <italic>Mocatta</italic> <italic>Goldsmid</italic> continued to buy gold and silver from aristocrats fleeing the <italic>French Revolution</italic> captured Spanish ships,<italic> Goldsmid</italic> funded government loans for the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Goldsmid</italic> invested in the first railroad, <italic>Surrey Iron</italic> RR of 1801, and served on other boards. To decentralize risk, Asher\u2019s brother Abraham of <italic>Goldsmid</italic> co-founded <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> by 1802. \nFor similar reasons that year, Mayer Rothschild\u2019s daughter married Speyer cousin Bernhard Sichel. A descendant of Michael Speyer through the Gans and a second cousin once removed of Frankfurt banker Benedikt Goldschmidt, Leo Schuster was born in Frankfurt to a cotton export merchant and moved to Britain. Like <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>Oppenheim Liepmann</italic> of Berlin, <italic>Merck</italic> of Hamburg, and Huguenot families <italic>Souchay</italic> and <italic>DuFay</italic> of Frankfurt sent agents to Manchester to trade cloth. Similarly, Protestant German merchant banks like <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Brandt</italic>, <italic>Huth</italic>, and <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen</italic> started in London. \nCornish landowners since the 16th century, Thomas Grylls founded <italic>Union Bank of Helston</italic> in 1788. In 1817, his daughter Cordelia married John Tippett, who in 1820 assumed the name Vivian. This occurred after the death of Lieutenant Colonel John Vivian in 1817, whose estate first passed to his cousin, James Vivian Tippett, and then to John Tippett upon James; death in 1820. While John Vivian operated the Hayle copper smelting plant, other members of the family expanded their business interests into banking. In 1812, Henry Vivian became a partner in <italic>Lemon</italic>, a bank in Truro, while in 1833 Captain William Vivian partnered in <italic>Kitson</italic> <italic>Vivian</italic> in Torquay. In 1826, John Vivian became a partner in <italic>Union Bank of Helston</italic> alongside his brothers-in-law. When John Vivian died in 1854, Cordelia inherited his stake in the bank and continued as a partner. \nA year after reorganizing <italic>Cornish </italic><italic>Mining Bank</italic> in 1771, William Vivian Lemon, John Lubbock of Norfolk, England, and others organized <italic>Lubbock</italic>. In the 1780s, <italic>Lubbock</italic> kinterlinked with <italic>Smyth</italic> as Anne Barnard married Abel Smyth\u2019s and her brother married Lubbock\u2019s aunt-in-law. By 1811, Smyth\u2019s widower son John married Emma Leigh, whose cousin married William Lemon\u2019s daughter. Having established <italic>Chester Old Bank</italic> in 1791, copper magnate Owen Williams of North Wales joined with Pascoe Grenfell to co-found Swansea\u2019s <italic>Copper</italic> <italic>Bank Smelting </italic>in 1803. The latter then started <italic>Grenfell</italic>, which partnered with <italic>Williams</italic> <italic>Foster</italic> of Cornwall, and along with <italic>Vivian</italic>, monopolized European copper.\nWhile <italic>Smyth</italic> branched to Derby, Samuel Gurney, trained at the Smyth, Bevan, and Barclay partnership, entered the bill-broking business of <italic>Richardson Overend</italic> with his brother to form <italic>Overend Gurney</italic> in 1807. After one Smyth was Deputy Chair of EIC in 1805, Smyths soon directed <italic>Alliance Insurance Co</italic> and Far East trader <italic>Magniac</italic>\u2014forerunner of <italic>Jardine Matheson</italic> (\u201c<italic>Jardine</italic>\u201d)\u2014and former in-law William Manning led West Indies trader <italic>Manning </italic>and <italic>London Assurance</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Smyth</italic> also kinterlinked with London stockbroker <italic>Zoete</italic>, Dutch refugees from the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>.\nDespite her relations to the Smyth and Manning family, the slavery affiliated <italic>Bird Savage </italic>defaulted in 1803, leading America\u2019s Minister to Britain, Rufus King, to shift to <italic>Baring</italic>. Instead, Quakers and metallurgists expanded. Since Isaac Spooner co-founded one of Birmingham\u2019s largest banks,<italic> Attwood Spooner</italic>, in 1791, his daughter wed <italic>Smyth</italic> cousin William Bird Wilberforce in 1797, and branched to London by 1801. \n<italic>Smyth</italic> had kinterlinked with the Wilberforce and Thornton cousins in 1756 after Tsarina Elizabeth\u2019s reforms. Through the Wrangham sisters, the Wilberforces connected to <italic>Russia Co</italic>\u2019s Raikes. Since <italic>Russia Co</italic>\u2019s John Cayley kinterlinked with Job\u2019s cousin-once-removed Timothy Raikes, Russia\u2019s former Court Banker Gomm, and Wilberforce in-laws, he became a partner of <italic>Thornton</italic>. Appointed British Consul-General and agent of <italic>Russia Co</italic> in 1787, he ended his <italic>Russia Co</italic> trading activities.\nTimothy Raikes\u2019<italic> </italic>cousin William was an East Indies merchant, and William\u2019s brother Thomas became Governor of BOE from 1797 to 1799. By then, Mary Raike\u2014Thomas Raike\u2019s niece\u2014married Isaac Currie. Currie\u2019s Scottish father had moved to London and married a daughter of Huguenot merchant Isaac Lefevre. After founding a distillery, he started a bank in Cornhill in 1773 with a former <italic>Fordyce</italic> clerk, that later became <italic>Currie</italic>. \nMary Raike\u2019s brother Job married a daughter of Jamaica plantation owner Nathaniel Bayly, whose son married a daughter of the 4th Earl of Jersey. Before another of  the Earl\u2019s daughters married 6th Duke of Argyll George Campbell, his son, 5th Earl of Jersey George Villiers, married Sophia Fane in 1804. Sophia\u2019s grandfather, Robert Child, had inherited <italic>Child</italic> with his widowed mother Agatha and brother Francis following the death of his father Samuel in 1752. \nWith the death of Agatha and Francis in 1763, Robert became Head Partner. He married Sarah Jodrell in 1763 and their daughter married 10th Earl of Westmorland John Fane in 1782. As Robert died that year, his widow Sarah continued to run <italic>Child</italic> until her granddaughter Sophia Fane became Head of <italic>Child</italic> from 1806 until her death in 1867. \nWhile dozens of women assumed leadership in provincial banks across Britain, often after the deaths of male relatives, within large Quaker kinterlinks, connections with Huguenots also grew. After Abraham Darby\u2019s grandson Samuel died in 1797, his unmarried sister Sarah Darby remained a partner in the ironworks. In 1802, Sarah transferred her partnership to Samuel\u2019s widow. In 1810, Sarah became the Senior Partner of the newly formed <italic>Coalbrookdale Bank</italic>, which included another sister-in-law and other family members. \nSeveral of Sarah Darby\u2019s sisters did not partake in the bank, including Mary, who had married a Rathbone. Since engaging in timber, commission work, and shipowning connected to the West Indies and Southern States, the Quaker Rathbones of Liverpool refused to supply slave ships and partnered with Robert Benson to form <italic>Rathbone Benson</italic> and shifted the firm to cotton trade with America in 1787. From drapers and cotton traders, the Quaker Bensons also partnered with Huguenots, engaging as an apprentice the son of Bourlet, who imported British cotton<italic> </italic>for <italic>Hottinguer</italic> out of Havre from 1824.\nTrained at the Smyth, Bevan, and Barclay partnership, Samuel Gurney and his brother entered the bill-broking business of <italic>Richardson Overend</italic> to form <italic>Overend Gurney</italic> in 1807, George Young Fox married Lucy Gurney Barclay in 1810. While George\u2019s grandmother was connected to <italic>Robarts</italic>, his mother, Catherine Payton Fox, had friendships and family ties with other female Quaker bankers, including her cousin Catherine Payton, Jane Saint-Aubyn, and the Darbys. Similarly, Elizabeth Came and Cordelia Vivian partnered in Cornwall through their families\u2019 involvement in copper smelting. \nSince their cousin-in-laws kinterlinked with the Coutts family in the 1780s, Duncombe cousins Beckett inherited the Leeds bank <italic>Beckett</italic> and their Denison cousins aligned with the Liverpool Heywood family and formed a London bank by 1806. While Elizabeth Denison married an aristocratic politician by then, she gained greater favor for her family by becoming the favorite mistress of King Charles IV in 1821.\nSome women in this era came from less elite backgrounds. Harriot Mellon, likely born out-of-wedlock, began her acting career as a child and continued performing until 1815, though she never became a leading actress. In 1815, she married the much older Thomas Coutts, who had inherited control of <italic>Coutts</italic> London, while William Forbes of Monymusk led the Edinburgh branch since 1773. \nAfter Coutts died in 1822, Mellon inherited his fortune and managed the partnership effectively alongside Forbes, despite tensions with Coutts\u2019 daughters. In 1827, she married William Beauclerk, the Duke of Saint-Albans; despite societal criticism, their union proved successful. After Forbes died in 1828, his son continued the legacy until the Edinburgh branch merged with <italic>Union Bank of Scotland</italic> in 1838.\nSince Britain de-criminalized poverty and federalized poor law administration in the 1830s, textiles mostly employed women and girls, child serfs made up a third of coalers. Between 1841 and 1842, Parliament limited coal mining only to adult men. America did so informally. As did most of Europe. Despite changes to business and inheritance laws, women mostly stopped working and leading banks and industry. While Parliament segregated laborers by sex while extending free incorporation, British women still accounted for 31% of laborers in 1861, a labor force participation level that would not return until 1961. Although English wife sales and public auctions fell from a record high in the 1840s, they survived until the 1910s. \nLike in Britain, Quaker women continued to run businesses across the Atlantic. Surviving the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>, one of America\u2019s first female executives Rebecca Pennock, wife of Charles Lukens, was born in 1794 into a Quaker family in Pennsylvania. Learning the family iron business from her father, Rebecca took over <italic>Brandywine Iron Works & Nail Factory</italic> after her husband died in 1825. She transformed it into a leading producer of high-quality iron for steam boilers, managing through tough times by assigning employees to maintenance or farm work and paying them with produce. <italic>Lukens</italic> continued as the oldest continuously operating American steel mill into the 20th century.\nSimilarly, since French women lost the right to vote and hold political office in 1791, their commercial and administrative jobs were often limited to subordinate roles like shorthand typists, paid less than men, and frequently hired based on family connections rather than merit, including at <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, and BDF.\nIn southern Germany, Chaile Kaulla gained most by supplying the military, financially leading Rothschild for decades. Because of their success, they faced condemnation from antisemites who accused them of commercial immorality, leading Chaile to lose her court appointment in 1798. Her nephew received it soon after. As the Duke Friedrich of W\u00fcrttemberg sought to prolong his debts, he convinced the Kaullas to start <italic>W\u00fcrttemberg Court Bank</italic><italic> </italic>in 1802. With less default risk, the Kaullas was strongest of all major Jewish banks. Instead of her husband\u2019s rabbinical name, Chaile\u2019s progeny adopted her maiden name, Kaulla. \nWomen also played key roles in Dutch banking. After Eduard Croese died in 1777, his widow Anna became his heir and guardian of their children. In 1783, her son Hendrik reached legal majority and, with Anna, founded <italic>Widow Croese & Son</italic> to trade goods and securities. In 1789, Anna transferred management to Hendrik and the firm became bankers to the Spanish Crown in 1798.\nWomen also helped reform society. From the 1790s, the Itzig-Jaffe sisters, Moses Mendelssohn, and other wealthy Berliners began hosting salons to break social and religious boundaries through conversation. Samuel Zbytkower\u2019s wife Judith hosted similar salons in Prussian Warsaw, as the King granted the family the privilege to acquire real estate in Warsaw and across the Kingdom. After expanding into grain to feed the Prussian army, widow Levy increased Prussian coin production in 1799, Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s daughter Cecilia divorced to marry Bernhard Eskeles. That year Moses Hirschel of Breslau, petitioned to renounce the Jewish religion, seeking a new form of Prussian citizenship.\nIn 1798, Tsar Paul Romanov appointed Christian <italic>Voute Velho Rall</italic> as Court bankers and foreign trade commission agents. The company comprised of Pierre Voute\u2014nephew of <italic>Hope</italic>\u2019s affiliate\u2014 Jose Pedro Celestino Velho, a Portuguese wine merchant, and Rall, a large textile mill owner kinterlinked with a Saint-Petersburg trading company. As Voute suddenly resigned months later, he was succeeded by Nikolai Rogovikov, son of an <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>State Bank</italic> Saint-Petersburg director and passementerie factory owner.\nWhile French <italic>assignats</italic> inflated in the 1790s, <italic>Directory</italic> replaced <italic>Convention </italic>in 1795 and deflated <italic>assignats</italic>. Surviving the upheaval of 1794, Pierre DuPont engaged in politics. However, he was imprisoned following an anti-royalist coup of late 1797, which also mandated emigrants depart from France. Questioning France\u2019s prospects, DuPont raised capital from shareholders with the aid of Huguenot banker Bidermann to buy and developing land in Virginia\u2019s western area and set up bank and export offices in Virginia and New York before immigrating there as <italic>Consulat </italic>seized power from <italic>Directory</italic> under General Napoleon Bonaparte in late 1799. \nAlthough Huguenots funded<italic> </italic>the revolutionary regimes, <italic>N\u00e9gociants R\u00e9unis</italic>\u2014mostly Catholic financiers and merchants including Claude P\u00e9rier, Florentin Seilli\u00e8re, Gabriel Ouvrard, and <italic>Perregaux</italic>\u2019s Jacques Laffitte\u2014organized <italic>Bank of France</italic> (\u201cBDF\u201d) to support the new regime to not rely on Huguenots. When Claude P\u00e9rier died in 1801, his son Antoine became a BDF Regent and parlayed <italic>Anzin</italic>\u2019s mining profits to found the Paris bank <italic>P\u00e9rier</italic>. From a Lorraine textile trading family, Florentin Seilli\u00e8re led the management of the Pierrepont factory near Longuyon. In 1789, Seilli\u00e8re obtained a 15-year lease for the Ruelle cannon foundry in Charente. By 1795, he shifted his focus to banking, first in Nancy, and, from 1798, in Paris. Continuing to supply the army, Florentin\u2019s son Nicolas arranged supplier credits, bond loans, and guarantees for military contracts by 1799.\nAlong with Hottinguer, the Court of BDF\u2019s Huguenots included Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Perregaux. Since moving to Paris in 1765, Perregaux established his Paris bank <italic>Perregaux</italic>, representing Isaac Panchaud and gaining wealth during the <italic>American Revolution</italic>. After marrying the heir of co-religionist Nicolas Beaujon, who had served King Louis XV through <italic>Beaujon Goossens</italic> alongside Court Banker Jean-Joseph Laborde, in 1778, Perregaux hired Jacques Laffitte in 1795. Laffitte, from Bayonne like Laborde and with a Laborde grandmother, later helped acquire Laborde\u2019s Paris house.\nTwo other Huguenot directors were Guillaume Mallet\u2014whose grandfather founded a Parisian bank in 1713 after his forefather fled Rouen for Geneva in 1558, where his family kinterlinked with Thellusson\u2014and Mallet\u2019s nephew-in-law from his first wife, Benjamin Lessert. Lessert was born in Lyon to banker \u00c9tienne Lessert and Madeleine LaTour, a sister-in-law of Genevan banker Bontems and Mallet. After military service, he joined his brothers at <italic>L</italic><italic>essert</italic> in 1796. became Regent of BDF in 1802.\nOther BDF shareholders included the wealthiest Jewish banker in Paris, Hayem Worms, and the converted Homberg. Despite the financial losses from the loss of slaving investments, Homberg\u2019s strategic marriages with Christians had forged influential connections in Le Havre and Rouen, including shipowners, merchants, legal professionals, and navy engineers. In contrast, Le Havre\u2019s Oppenheims formed less advantageous connections and were less affluent.\nAs Huguenots funneled their wealth overseas\u2014with Cazenove\u2019s brother-in-law Boulay BOE\u2019s leading shareholder for a period\u2014Parisians were more satisfied with notarial intermediation over government issued <italic>assignat</italic> scrip with little interest in BDF. So, Counsel Napoleon delegalized notary intermediation and subsequently granted BDF a note issue monopoly in Paris. During the <italic>Panic of 1803</italic>, the established banking system collapsed, and a crisis erupted by the summer. That year, Napoleon legitimized all Huguenot worship and Hottinguer branched to Nantes to import American cotton. By 1805, France tariffed limited colonial trade.\nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1803</italic>, a Cazenove married an Odier cousin of Geneva\u2019s <italic>Lombard</italic>. In Swiss Geneva, amidst the economic turmoil of the French Revolution, three major banks collapsed in 1792. Recovery soon began. Descended from Brandenburg immigrant, silk merchant Henri Hentsch formed a commission house in 1796 and then combined with Swiss Italian Lombard<italic> </italic>family following the annexation of Geneva by France in 1798. While Hentsch soon left for Paris and served as General Bonaparte\u2019s payment intermediary in 1800, <italic>Lombard</italic> combined with <italic>Lullin</italic> to bank out of Geneva. By 1805, <italic>Candolle Mallet</italic> formed in the city.\nSince Henry Hope fled to London in 1793, his underwriters, including Willem Borski and Herman Insinger of Lower Saxony, managed <italic>Hope</italic>\u2019s affairs in Amsterdam. <italic>Borski</italic> dominated Amsterdam money and fund trading, while Insinger founded <italic>Insinger</italic> with his brother-in-law Hans Swarth in 1801, specializing in West Indies commodity trading, plantation financing, and estate settlement. Although <italic>Hope</italic> resumed limited operations in Amsterdam by 1802, <italic>Borski</italic> and <italic>Insinger</italic> continued their ventures. In addition to forming two trust offices, Borski co-founded cashier note issuing<italic> Associatie Cassa</italic> by 1806. After Insinger\u2019s death in 1805, his widow Anna Swarth assumed ownership of <italic>Insinger</italic> with her brother Hans serving as Managing Partner.\nAmong <italic>Borski</italic>\u2019s largest projects with <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Hope</italic> involved France and Russia. Since Spain ceded territory in the Americas to France in 1801, Napoleon tried to restore slavery in Saint-Domingue in 1803. However, President Jefferson threatened war to prevent this encroachment. As Napoleon agreed to sell the Louisiana Territory to America, <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Hope</italic> financed the transaction with <italic>N\u00e9gociants </italic><italic>R</italic><italic>\u00e9unis</italic>. The same year, a cousin of Pierre Labouchere\u2014of <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Hope</italic>\u2014kinterlinked with the Belgian financial establishment, a fourth great nephew Elizabeth Coymans.\nWhile Tsar Paul Romanov ennobled the partners of <italic>Velho Rall Rogovikov</italic> as barons in 1800, he was assassinated a year later, and Velho died the following year. However, <italic>Rall Rogovikov</italic> remained Russia\u2019s Court bankers under Paul\u2019s son Tsar Alex. With outstanding Russian debts, <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Hope</italic>, and <italic>Borski</italic> organized a triangular agreement wherein the proceeds from the Louisiana sale would indirectly pay for French purchases of Russian ships by servicing Russian debts in Amsterdam via <italic>Borski</italic>. \nMeanwhile, German Court Jews restructured. Since Mayer Rothschild sold coins to Hessian Prince Wilhelm from 1764, Wilhelm\u2019s father, the Landgrave of Hesse made a fortune on mercenaries to Britain during America\u2019s <italic>Revolution</italic>. Mayer had limited influence as the Landgrave of Hesse appointed Speyer-in-law David Feidel\u2019s son, Feidel David, his Court Jew in 1792. Feidel\u2019s daughters married Frankfurt calico merchant Ellissen, Altona banker Popert, Hanover Court Jew Alex Levi, and S\u00fc\u00dfkind Oppenheim and Moses Goldschmidt of Hamburg, since their brother married a Speyer cousin Kulp in the 1770s.\nWhile Speyer\u2019s capital was six times that of the Rothschilds in 1800, Mayer Rothschild strategically utilized court Jewish patents granted by Emperor Franz II in 1800 for himself and his sons to enhance their financial credibility and social standing. That year, Mayer Rothschild\u2019s son married Caroline Stern, a daughter of <italic>Stern</italic> banker Samuel Stern\u2014a descendant of the Frankfurt Kanns and an extended Oppenheim and Wertheim cousin\u2014and Sarah Kulp\u2014a cousin descendant and a third cousin of Imperial Court Banker Michael Speyer.\nStarting with Bavaria in 1799 and ending with Prussia in 1806, Germany voided court patent contracts. Reorganizing the \u2018Court Jew\u2019 institution, bankers became businessmen and less at risk of the whims of royal absolutism. Many aspects of the system continued, particularly the hereditary nature of offices and accelerating imperialism. \nWhile princes with absolute power drove demand for Court Jews from the <italic>Thirty Years\u2019 War</italic>, Court Jews were instrumental in Jewish emancipation, their descendants gained influence across various sectors. The conversions and intermarriage integrated Court Jews into German society, eliminating their sociological special status, marking the end of individuals and the rise of inter-empire bankers and political advisors. As empire, and assimilation grew with war decades before the emergence of large banks.\nLong serving the Wittelsbach dynasty in the Palatinate, Seligmann prospered as the Elector of Palatinate expanded into Bavaria and dissolved contracts with Wertheim and other Court Jews. The most influential court factors in Bavaria and Baden around 1800, Seligmanns of Leiman held prominent positions as court factors in Mannheim, Karlsruhe, Stuttgart, Munich, Bamberg, Augsburg, and Dresden. \nLikewise, Seligmann kinterlinked with French Jews, marrying Isaac Orchel\u2019s niece in 1803. After becoming Court Jew of Bavaria in 1805, Seligmann\u2019s daughter wed Imperial Court Jew Isaac Speyer\u2019s son in 1807. While Chaile Kaulla continued to lead <italic>Kaulla</italic><italic> </italic>out of Stuttgart, her son Veit wed the daughter of Imperial Court Jew Amschel Goldschmidt\u2014Joseph Goldschmid\u2019s second great-grandson\u2014and founded <italic>Kaulla</italic> Augsburg to serve the Wittelsbachs. \nBy then pre-revolutionary Christians reclaimed control of French banking and industry. After the fall of Robespierre in 1794, brothers Jean and Bernard T\u00fcrckheim returned to Strasbourg and rebuilt their bank. In 1805, they advanced funds to the French government for military salaries. Although even aristocratic women were denied women the right to vote or hold office after 1791, French disruption required more women to take business leadership roles. Panchaud\u2019s sister-in-law Marie-Louise Gu\u00e9rin led inter-Mediterranean silk merchant banking out of Lyon following the death of her husband in 1795. \nAfter her brother, the mayor of Strasbourg was guillotined in 1793, Huguenot Am\u00e9lie Dietrich inherited <italic>Dietrich</italic>, France\u2019s third-largest iron forge, but her husband managed the enterprise until his death in 1806, when Am\u00e9lie took over. Similarly, Nicole-Barbe Cliquot took over her late husband\u2019s champagne house in 1805, and later defied Napoleon by sending secret shipments to Russia. After the revolution, she married her daughter to a count as her competitor, Mo\u00ebt, kinterlinked with the Chandon family of magistrates with aristocratic ties.\nSince widow Helen Krupp took over the family business and invested in Rhenish mining companies, she refused to relinquish managerial authority to her son until her death in 1810. The following year, her grandson Friedrich founded Krupp to produce English cast steel during Napoleon\u2019s Continental Blockade. After the partners\u2019 steelmaking efforts failed, Friedrich took sole control in 1816 but struggled financially. Following Friedrich\u2019s death in 1826, his widow Therese and their son Alfred continued operations. \nAs Napoleon made his way through Europe, Austrian finance reinforced familial bonds. Since an heiress of the Austrian Mint Jew Duschenes family married Simon L\u00e4mel, a Bohemian descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe. In 1787, Simon was granted residence in Prague and founded a wholesale trading house, entering the wool trade. Likewise, his siblings kinterlinked with Bondi, Oppenheim K\u00f6nigswarter in-law of the Arnsteins, and Wertheim heirs. From 1801, he served as a military supplier, acquiring goods for the Austrian military and treasury from advancing French forces. Likewise, Austria\u2019s Christian bankers kinterlinked as a <italic>Fries</italic> son marrying an aristocratic cousin of fellow <italic>Fugger</italic> descendant Prince Schwarzenberg in 1801.\nHowever, as Napoleon invaded Austria and Germany, inflation spread in the <italic>Panic of 1806</italic>. After he decreed a moratorium on debts owed by peasants to protect them from Jewish usurers, he convened the Assembly of Notables to reform Jewish practices and reduce reliance on usury. While Count Mol\u00e9 recommended stripping them of civil rights, veteran council members supported integration under the principles of equality established by the Revolution. \nThe Assembly of Notables led to the Grand Sanhedrin, with representatives including Jewish rabbis and bankers across the empire under the presidency of Rabbi David Sintzheim, By 1808, decrees formalized the organization of Jewish communities in France, reaffirming the structure established by the Assembly of Notables, imposing strict regulations on loans, commerce, conscription, and residency. Likewise, Napoleon limited speculation with his <italic>Commercial Code</italic>. As Huguenots continued to select godparents to reinforce trust bonds, the concept did not exist for Jews. However, Napoleon<italic> </italic>secularized marriage witnessing, and French Jews adopted the practice. \nWith the dissolution of the thousand-year-old German Empire, W\u00fcrttemberg became a kingdom and allowed Kaulla to move to Stuttgart. Among the first Jews allowed into W\u00fcrzburg during the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> after centuries, Jacob Hirsch-Gereuth (\u201cHirsch\u201d) became Bavaria\u2019s Court Jew, he became the first Jew to gain freedom of movement in 1806. Allying with Napoleon, Bavaria enlarged and absorbed self-ruled cities. Invading Europe and Turkey, Napoleon\u2019s <italic>Code</italic> replaced primogeniture with partible inheritance to fracture political control. But serfdom continued in east Prussia, Egypt, and beyond. \nIncreasingly, Katz-cousins and Court Jews interlinked trade from Germany through Holland to Britain.  Like Hamburg\u2019s <italic>Warburg</italic> extended cousins wed their extended delBanco cousin, Bondi\u2014a cousin of the Dresden Court Jew and descendant of the Kings of Judah, Katz, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, Joseph Goldschmidt, and Lipman Cohen-Behrens\u2014in 1803, Denis Samuel, the son of Katz-descendant Moses Samuel and Rachel Phillips, married Esther, Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s daughter. In Venice, Napoleon ennobled the Treves family, dating back to the Jewish princes of Narbonne, for financing a treaty with the Barbary pirates, and launching Venice\u2019s first food shipping venture with the Americas. Likewise, Todros, also with Narbonne roots, and of Davidic descendant, kinterlinked with the Katz-<italic>Samuel Phillips</italic>.\nDuring the French occupation of Prussia, Jewish Liepmann Walf and Sprinze Levy competed with the Christian <italic>Benecke</italic> and <italic>Schickler</italic> to raise funds for the state<italic> </italic><italic>Schickler</italic> evolved from Berlin\u2019s <italic>Splitgerber Daum</italic>, which was connected to Alsatian David Schickler, who took over and renamed the firm <italic>Schickler</italic> in 1795. With branches in Bordeaux, <italic>Schickler\u2019</italic>s balance sheet tripled between 1800 and 1813. The consortium typically consisted of two Christians and one Jew, with <italic>Schickler</italic> and <italic>Benecke</italic> being the dominant players.  \nAs Walf was Berlin\u2019s wealthiest Jew, his son-in-law, Jacob Beer, served as President of <italic>Berlin Stock Exchange</italic> from 1803 and owned the smallest of Berlin\u2019s four sugar refineries, which he expanded in both Prussia and Italy. Since Sprinze Levy died in 1804, her sons continued to support Prussia. By 1806, the Levys converted to Lutheranism and entered politics as nobles after changed their surname to Delmar<italic>.</italic> \nBut Jewish competition grew. Founding <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> in 1803, Samuel Bleichr\u00f6der focused on FX and affiliated with<italic> Rothschild</italic>. Bleichr\u00f6der\u2019s father had married a great-grandniece of Prussian Court Jewess Esther Schulhoff Liebmann and engaged in business with Prussian Mint Jew Ephraims in Berlin from the 1760s. Likewise, Samuel married his cousin-once-removed, reinforcing his Schulhoff connections with the Berlin Arons. \nIn 1805, Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s son Abraham married Prussian Mint Jew Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s granddaughter and opened <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Hamburg metal merchant banking with his <italic>Fould</italic>-trained brother Joseph, and then added his son-in-law\u2019s uncle, Joseph Frankel. Joseph Frankel had married Caroline Levy Halle, whose mother was a grandniece of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe and father was Court Jew Joel Halle, Glikl Pinkerle Goldschmidt\u2019s grandnephew. In Warsaw, Joseph Levy Frankel\u2019s cousin Samuel Frankel\u2014Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s grandnephew and Levy-Delmar cousin\u2014married the widow of Karol Laski, Zbytkower\u2019s daughter, and absorbed <italic>Laski</italic> into<italic> Frankel</italic>. Like most of Zbytkower\u2019s children and some Frankel cousins in Prussia, Frankel\u2019s family baptized in 1806 to remain in Poland after Napoleon fell. \nSince 1741, Samuel Frankel\u2019s sister was married to Berliner Hirsch Magnus\u2019 son. Descended from the Protected Jews of Schwedt in Prussian Brandenburg, the Magnus family had rivaled Court Jew Johann Liebman. By 1741, Hirsch Magnus relocated to Berlin after marrying the daughter of a Protected Jew from the city, who was related to Daniel Itzig-Jaffe. After Hirsch worked as an accountant for Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s brother-in-law, his daughter married a Protected Jew of Glogau in 1742. After trading textiles, Hirsch\u2019s nephew, Johann, became a Berlin banker in 1809, and his son, Friedrich, later married Samuel Frankel\u2019s daughter and joined his father\u2019s bank.\nWith the dissolution of the German Empire, Napoleon elevated the Saxon Elector to King of Saxony and Poland in 1806. Around this time, Philippine Kaskele withdrew from the family bank, leaving her sons, to manage operations. As marriages with the H\u00f6nig and Glogau families kinterlinked them with the Frankel and Goldsmid families, the Kaskels banked forces for and against France. \nWhile Michael married a Glogau and took over <italic>Kaskele</italic> Dresden, his brother Jacob and brother-in-law Adolph Glogau established a bank in Leipzig. Despite opposition from Leipzig Retailers' Guild, the Deputation of Commerce, citing Glogau\u2019s connections to Oder and Kaskele\u2019s relatives in Posen, approved it. Within a year, brother Baer Kaskele became a royal court agent in Warsaw, to where he advanced funds on behalf of Saxony in 1811. Meanwhile, brother Carl provided funds to Austria as his nephew served in Austrian Army.  \nLikewise, Katz-descendant Zevi Ashkenasy\u2019s descendants linked London and Hamburg. One descendant of Ashkenasy\u2019s Hamburger son-in-law\u2014and so related to Glikl Goldschmidt\u2014kinterlinked with <italic>Bank of Hamburg</italic>\u2019s Beit family and became a procurator for <italic>Goldschmidt</italic> Hamburg, where he interacted with Joseph Mendelssohn and Salomon Heine. Descended from another son-in-law of Ashkenasy, the granddaughters of Hirschel Levin and Yitzhak Teomin Frankel soon married a Henriques of Hamburg, a cousin of delBanco and Warburg.\nAfter redefining urban citizenship to include all qualified individuals regardless of religion in 1808, Prussia granted Jews economic freedoms but excluding them from state service in 1812. Bavaria\u2019s 1813 decree granted Jews economic citizenship without addressing political rights and offered fewer benefits than Prussia. \nBy 1808, Mayer Rothschild\u2019s daughter married a Frankfurt banking heir Beyfus descended from Austrian Court Jews Samson Wertheim and Isaac Arnstein. As Frankfurt\u2019s old political bodies lost influence, power shifted to departmental authorities, where Christian guilds held sway. While Frankfurt elected Rothschild to the electoral college in 1811, tensions led to a reversion to old policies until civil equality was restored in 1824, and political equality decades later. Rothschild soon hired Mendelssohn as his Berlin agent. When <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Berlin reopened, she refused to participate in a forced loan in 1812 until receiving an assessment. \nAs Liepmann Walf died in 1812, his son-in-law Jacob Beer was assessed the highest amount in Berlin. The same year, the King of Prussia emancipated the city\u2019s wealthy Jews from rabbinical autonomy in 1812, although full equality was decades away. After his cousin married Beer\u2019s son in 1818, Joseph Mendelssohn challenged guilds by founding Berlin\u2019s <italic>Merchant Corp</italic> in 1820 and served on its Council of Elders alongside Beer, who died in 1825. Baptizing in 1816, Joseph\u2019s nephew Alex wed Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s granddaughter in 1821. As his brother also baptized the following year, Alex took over as head of <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> in Berlin in 1828 and raised his children Lutheran. This may have led <italic>Rothschild</italic> to replace <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> with Gerson Bleichr\u00f6der as her Berlin agent in the late 1820s after his cousins kinterlinked with the Friedl\u00e4nds. \nSince K\u00f6nigsberg banker Mendel Oppenheim married a daughter of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe in 1792, his brother Wolff banked in Berlin, and hired Marcus Warschauer, who had advanced from apprentice work in Breslau, in 1805. Warschauer moved to K\u00f6nigsberg, soon marrying Wolff\u2019s daughter and becoming a partner in what became <italic>Oppenheim Warschauer</italic>. In 1811 the firm smuggled British goods in violation of the Blockade, supplying spirits to Prussia, working with <italic>Stieglitz </italic>and <italic>Rothschild</italic>. <italic>Oppenheim Warschauer</italic> led the consortium for the Prussian state loan of 1817. Likewise, their Oppenheim Friedl\u00e4nd cousins converted and reinforced kinterlinks with the Heines in 1821.\nAs Prague-born Simon L\u00e4mel supplied the Austrian military with goods from France since 1800, his daughter Elise married Heinrich Herz, a Prague wholesale merchant and sugar factory owner, in 1818. His father was related to Moses Mendelssohn and a Protected Jew of Leipzig, whose other daughter wed Elias Goldschmidt of Kassel, a descendant of Joseph Goldschmidt, Lipman Cohen-Behrens, and Samson Wertheim. While L\u00e4mel became a coin supplier in 1810, Habsburg Emperor Francis II denied his request to purchase property but granted him Austrian nobility in 1811.\nSince L\u00e4mel\u2019s daughter Therese married Isak Arnstein\u2019s descendant Anton Offenheim, a privileged wholesale merchant of Vienna and Imperial Russian Commercial Councilor, they divorced in 1812. While Offenheim married Isaac Arnstein\u2019s granddaughter in 1815 and was baptized a year later, Therese wed a Prague merchant. The same year, L\u00e4mel\u2019s son Leo married the daughter of the converted Court Jew Elias Seligmann, whom the Wittelsbacher dynasty had ennobled as \u2018Eichthal\u2019 in 1814 for funding and supplying Bavaria through the war. \nAs Eichthal and Kaskele kinterlinked, the Eichthal and L\u00e4mel families connected the Saxon bankers Herz and Kasekele. After serving as Kommissar under Prince Karl Schwarzenberg\u2014brother of the Vienna banker\u2014in the victory against Napoleon at the <italic>Battle of </italic><italic>the Nations</italic> in 1813, L\u00e4mel received approval for a wholesale trading license in Vienna in 1818, soon competing with the city\u2019s largest firms.\nSince Delmar became Prussia\u2019s first ennobled Jew in 1810, Bavarian banker Jacob Hirsch gained nobility in 1818, and in Baden, Solomon Haber was ennobled in 1829. The practice extended to W\u00fcrttemberg, Hesse, Saxony, and elsewhere. Many converted, included Moses Hirschel\u2019s family, and some Itzig-Jaffes and Arnsteins, sometime splitting families. \nWithout a male heir, Nathan Arnstein and Fanny Itzig-Jaffe adopted their son-in-law Heinrich Pereira, nephew of Empress Maria-Theresa\u2019s Court Jew Diego Aguilar. Another of Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s grandsons converted to Protestantism and entered Prussian government service By the time Chaile Kaulla died in 1809, she donated much of her wealth. As her sons joined <italic>W\u00fcrttemberg Court Bank</italic>, W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019s King issued a decree in 1817 to regulate the affairs with supervisory board oversight. After Chaile\u2019s son Veit died, his Goldschmidt widow ran<italic> Kaulla</italic> Augsburg, which had the most employees of any bank in the Imperial City along with Arnold Eichthal. By then, Hamburg textile merchant Philipp Beit married a daughter of Court David Feidel, kinterlinking with her Speyer Kulp, Goldschmidt, and Oppenheim sibling-in-laws.\nAs Mayer Rothschild\u2019s son Nathan finished his apprenticeship with <italic>Cohen-Barent</italic>, he married Esther\u2019s sister Hannah Cohen-Barent. With the death of his father in 1803, Prince Wilhelm became Landgrave. As fears of French invasion grew in Germany, Landgrave Wilhelm fled Hesse entrusting Mayer Rothschild with safekeeping this treasure until stability returned. The provisions allowed Nathan to lend this gold out from London through 1823. Along with <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic> shipped gold to pay British forces in Europe as BOE continued to not payout gold for <italic>pounds</italic>. Likewise, Frankfurt families reinforced bonds. In 1807, Rothschild\u2019s cousin David Weisweiller married his Goldschmidt cousin. \nBy then, Britain abolished the slave trade and eased bankruptcy, mostly due to sugar overproduction. As America\u2019s Congress banned slave import in 1808, trade collapsed soon after with a general trade embargo. America\u2019s dominant slave trader was <italic>Franklin Armfield</italic>, which vertically integrated with steamboats. British European trade resumed as Spain revolted in 1808 and Napoleon diverted troops from northern Europe. Without restoring <italic>pound</italic> gold convertibility, BOE discounted more trade bills. \nThe Blockade and inflation drove the in-law of Hessian Court Jew Feidel, David Ellissen, to start <italic>Ellissen</italic> in Frankfurt to trade British textiles after his daughter married the brother of Imperial Court Jew Isaac Speyer. While Nathaniel Rothschild brought his cousins and in-laws, including Rindskopf, Oppenheim cousin d\u2019Worms, and Sichel, to London, older merchant banking kinterlinks, such Christian <italic>DeSmeth </italic>of Amsterdam with spinning textiles operators in Ghent faced competition.\nAs Napoleon forced his <italic>Code</italic> unto Hamburg and other German states, commerce disrupted in the <italic>Panic of 1810</italic>, originating in L\u00fcbeck, spread to Amsterdam, Paris, and Ghent. As BDF\u2019s discount rates surged and commodity prices collapsed amidst bankruptcies of <italic>Widow Croese & Son</italic>,<italic> DeSmeth </italic>of Amsterdam (and their merchant in-laws in Ghent), <italic>Bidermann </italic>and <italic>Fould</italic> of Paris, and the self-liquidation of <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> of Hamburg. \nAnd as banks across Britain failed, the head of <italic>Goldsmid</italic> committed suicide in the face of bankruptcy. Following <italic>Goldsmid</italic>\u2019s fall, <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> limited members only to trading without banking from 1812. <italic>Rothschild</italic> London<italic> </italic>took over <italic>Goldsmid</italic>\u2019s banking business to lead<italic> Exchequer</italic> debt brokerage and MMBU in competition with <italic>Baring</italic>. Nathan Rothschild selected Moses Montefiore as his stockbroker.\nUntil the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 ended Napoleon\u2019s European dominance, <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> reacted swiftly to news from battlefields, with bond prices fluctuating based on victories or defeats. In 1814, a group of speculators spread false news of Napoleon\u2019s death, causing bond prices to rise. Others did the opposite. Without participating in such market manipulation, Nathan Rothschild built a communication network, including couriers, ships, horses, and pigeons, to ensure that he received news promptly.\nSince Britons ran from inflating banknotes to gold, gold traders and assayers made fortunes and solidified relationships. Moses Mocatta Montefiore remained indebted for years after suffering from fraud in 1806. In 1810, Moses joined the Surrey militia and became captain. After his sister married a Goldsmid in 1810 and cousin married a Guedalla, Court Jew of Morocco, in 1811, Moses married Judith Samuel Cohen-Barent, Nathan Rothschild\u2019s sister-in-law, in 1812, became his new in-law\u2019s stockbroker with his brother Abraham. \nAs Asher Goldsmid married a Katz Samuel descendant in 1813 and his converted Prager nephew married a granddaughter of British Court Jew David Franks in 1815. That year, Moses paid his creditors, Abraham wed Hannah\u2019s sister-in-law Henriette Rothschild and his sister married Hannah\u2019s brother. <italic>Rothschild</italic>-in-law and Oppenheim cousin d\u2019Worms also opened a bank in London that year. But the run to gold also fueled other businesses, including Percival Johnson of an old family of assayers since 1750, who established <italic>Johnson</italic> in London in 1817, gaining distinction for refined gold bullion.\nSince Napoleon combined Prussian and Austrian Poland to create the independent Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, most of the Duchy was ceded to Russia, adding around 3 million Polish and 300,000 Jewish citizens. From the late 18th century, Jews in Eastern Europe engaged in interregional and international trade, including lumber exports, vodka production, and wine imports. During the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, merchant bankers, such as the Peretz and Nota families in Shklov and the Zbytkower and Kronenberg families in the Duchy, served as supply contractors for armies. Born into a rabbinical family in Polish Wyszogrod, Kronenberg adopted his surname and Haskalah ideals and began engaging in trade and banking in Warsaw during the Prussian period. In 1808, he adopted European-style clothing, cut his beard, and founded <italic>Kronenberg</italic> bank.\nFollowing the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, Polish industrial efforts focused on textiles, food production, and tobacco in cities like Bialystok, Warsaw, and Lodz. As government restrictions largely excluded Jews from textile production in Lodz and elsewhere, they dominated the raw material supply chain. Jewish capitalist ventures were primarily concentrated in regions where industrialization was already underway, focusing on sectors such as textiles, food, and tobacco. Jews also thrived in new industries like sugar processing, where they circumvented land ownership laws and beet cultivation by leasing lands from nobility.\nAfter Samuel Zbytkower died in 1800, his widow Judith did not remarry. Working with her stepson Berek and relatives in Oder and Prussian Poland, she supplied troops before becoming Warsaw\u2019s leading bankers. The descendants of Samuel Zbytkower and their spouses founded a fifth of all the banks in Central Poland. With the death of her husband Karol Laski in 1803, Zbytkower\u2019s daughter married Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s grandnephew and Levy cousin Samuel Frankel, who absorbed <italic>Laski</italic> into<italic> Frankel</italic><italic> </italic>and worked with his mother-in-law Judith. Like most of Zbytkower\u2019s children and some Frankel cousins in Prussia, Frankel\u2019s family baptized in 1806 to remain in Poland after Napoleon fell. \nBy then, many Polish Jews joined Russia against Napoleon. Since Russia annexed the Duchy of Warsaw, Tsar Alex Romanov\u2019s Court battled the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> using Polish Court Jews Samuel Zbytkower, Leyzer Dillon of Neswisch, and Samuel Epstein. Convincing her husband Berek Zbytkower to found a Hasidic synagogue in 1807, Temerel Horowitz bought real estate And as Berek\u2019s aid influenced Napoleon\u2019s 1812 campaign, he soon became Poland\u2019s wealthiest Jew. Their daughter wed a Katz-descendant Horowitz. Similarly, the Epsteins kinterlinked with the Horowitz, Landau, Schiff, and Pernas families.\nBut the 1812 campaign also created new wealth. Of unknown relation to Samuel, candle trader Jacob Epshteyn became a military supplier since serving in the Polish army in the <italic>Uprising of 1794</italic>. However, the Duchy of Warsaw transformed into the Congress Poland under Russia in 1815. While he requested \u2018full civic freedom\u2019 from the new regime, citing his donations and his father\u2019s privileges, his request was denied. As Berek Zbytkower leased the Polish state salt mine in 1816, his wife\u2019s Horowitz cousin married the granddaughter of deceased Prince Potemkin\u2019s Court Advisor Joshua Zeitlin. By 1818, Epshteyn\u2019s son married Zbytkower\u2019s Oesterreicher cousin. \nDespite the Russian conquest, Polish magnates continued to monopolize land ownership and engage Jewish leaseholders. In Minsk Guberniya, the Radziwill family remained dominant landowners. Antoni Radziwill, 12th Prince-Ordynat of Neswisch, controlled 12 Jews in three villages in 1808 and inherited Neswisch in 1813. He died in 1832, succeeded by his son Wilhelm and grandson Antoni, who united Neswisch with Kletsk in 1874. Jozef Radziwill, 9th Prince-Ordynat of Kletsk, controlled 169 Jews in 56 villages in 1808. After his death in 1813, Kletsk passed to Michal Radziwill, who controlled 288 Jews in 47 villages, and later to Leon Radziwill in 1831. As Hasidic leaders gained power in Russian and Austrian Poland, they emulated monarchs with dynasties of Hasidic Courts. While few of the families originated with prominent lineages, intermarriages with Katz and several other old families to preclude any upstart competition into the 20th century. \nInstead of unrelated agents like in most places, <italic>Rothschild </italic>London came to rely on in-law cousins for Brazilian gold, diamonds, and other commodities. After French invasion led Portuguese royals to flee to Brazil in 1807, cousins Denis Samuel and Alfred Phillips started a business in Rio de Janeiro. Brother-in-law Nathan Rothschild partnered with <italic>Samuel Phillips</italic>, financing British armies in the early 1810s and kinterlinked with the Goldsmids. As <italic>Samuel Phillips</italic> became <italic>Rothschild </italic>London\u2019s Brazil agent in 1815, <italic>Samuel Phillips</italic> thrived with close relations with the Imperial family and government. In 1824, <italic>Rothschild</italic> became the government\u2019s agent, with <italic>Samuel Phillips</italic> facilitating transactions. \nWhen his family was associated with Berlin\u2019s Haskalah, Mayer Davidzon moved to London in 1803, he helped fund British troops in Europe via Amsterdam in 1814. Marrying Nathan Rothschild\u2019s sister-in-law Jessy Cohen-Barent in 1816, Mayer Davidzon served as <italic>Rothchild</italic> London\u2019s principal clerk. By then, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s capital greatly surpassed the capital of leading Anglo-American bankers <italic>Brown</italic> and <italic>Baring</italic>.\nDanish Jewish emancipation mirrored that of France and Prussia, with Jews allowed to join guilds in 1788, buy real estate in 1802, and gain citizenship from 1814 after the expenses of the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> and loss of Norway. The first Danish Jew to gain citizenship was Hartvig R\u00e9e. R\u00e9e was the son of Philip, a grandson of the Chief Rabbi of Copenhagen, who started <italic>R\u00e9e</italic> to trade and supported the Haskalah by spreading Mendelssohn\u2019s ideas. \nAfter inheriting <italic>R\u00e9e</italic> in 1799, Hartvig expanded into shipping\u2014importing coal, iron, salt, hops, and exporting grain, wool, hides, and skins\u2014and manufacturing, establishing a sugar refinery, a printing press, and dyeing and cloth factories. Along with credit from <italic>Warburg </italic>of Hamburg, <italic>R\u00e9e</italic> grew as Hartvig\u2019s brother wed a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s uncle in 1811. While another brother married a Warburg of Hamburg in 1826, a cousin wed a broker third great-grandson of Lipman Cohen-Behrens in 1829. \nOther Danish Jews converted. Born to a Jewish Levite merchant banker, Joseph Hambro changed his name, became a wholesale dealer, and pioneered steam in Denmark. He had married a Christian and in 1820, became the Court Councilor of Denmark. Within two years, he celebrated the baptism of his son, Carl, at fifteen. \nJews also helped industrialize Sweden. The son of a merchant and the only Jew with residence rights in Treuenbrietzen, Mecklenburg, Aron Isak began as a peddler and seal-engraver under the Mint Jew of Schwerin, who kinterlinked with the Wertheims, in the 1750s. In 1774, he used his trade and military contacts to enter Sweden, where he established the Jewish community in Stockholm. From the 1790s, Isak worked with Michael Benedicks, whose niece married him in 1802, the year he gained trade rights in jewels and gold. \nBorn in Bleicherode, Benedicks worked for Jakob Gomperz and the Prussian War Commissariat before joining Isak in Stockholm. After his wife died, Benedicks married Henriette Halle of Hamburg in 1804 and co-founded jewelry factory<italic> Benedicks</italic>. Benedicks managed state purchases in London during the wars of 1808 and 1812. He and his brother Wilhelm became Swedish citizens by decree in 1811 and burghers three years later, followed by antisemitic agitation. Wilhelm married Josephine Seligmann in 1816, before her sister married Alex Mendelssohn in 1821. By then, Benedicks had bought the iron works of Gysinge.\nLikewise, after Jeremiah Katz (of unknown relationship to the other Katz) became a Protected Jew of Schwaan, Mecklenburg, in 1757, his son Philip moved to Sweden in 1789 and settled in Norrk\u00f6ping in 1790. From two wives, Philip\u2019s sons adopted the surname Philipson. While giving permission to his eldest Carl to marry a Christian in 1813 and become an industrialist in Link\u00f6ping, Philip\u2019s other son Jacob became a wholesaler in Norrk\u00f6ping, and his son Mauritz followed the family trade. In 1822, half-brothers Jacob and Mauritz Philipson became partners in their father\u2019s firm, <italic>Philip</italic>. Jacob focused on agriculture, cattle breeding, and dairy management, while Mauritz engaged in publishing and banking.\nThrough the late 18th century, Saint-Petersburg was Russia\u2019s most developed port city. Following the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> spread from Hamburg and Amsterdam to Saint-Petersburg, Riga, and London to import Russian grain. Following the death of <italic>Rall Rogovikov</italic>\u2019s Rogovikov\u2019s death in 1809, Velho\u2019s in-law Severin assumed his Court Banker position. However, <italic>Rall Severin </italic>gradually lost <italic>Hope</italic>\u2019s respect. While Alex Rall retained his court banker role until 1817, when he ceded to Ludwig Stiglitz\u2019s <italic>Stiglitz</italic>.\nAfter Hirsch Stiglitz became the Court Jew of Waldeck in the late 18th century, his nephews Phillip and Jacob Mark migrated to New York. The brothers served as the Paymaster of the Waldeck mercenary troops during the Revolution and engaged in the Dutch trade by 1785. Dissolving the partnership with his brother in 1793, Jacob partnered with John Speyer (of a likely but unknown relation to <italic>Speyer</italic>), while brother Phillip accepted President George Washington\u2019s appointment as the American consul for Franconia. Subsequently, Hirsch Stiglitz\u2019s son Joseph joined Phillip in New York in 1796. Anglicizing his name to Sterlitz, and forming <italic>Mark Sterlitz</italic> together. Soon after, <italic>Mark Speyer</italic> failed in 1799, with creditors including James Roosevelt and John Murray. <italic>Mark Sterlitz</italic> never recovered after Phillip\u2019s death. \nHirsch Stiglitz\u2019s other sons that remained in Europe had grander successes. While one son converted in 1793 to marry an Ephraim\u2014descended from the siblings of Glikl, Joseph Goldschmidt, Koppel Frankel, and was a cousin-in-law of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe and Moses Mendelsohn\u2014and served as Court doctor, another wed a Heine cousin after establishing Saint-Petersburg bank <italic>Stiglitz</italic> in 1803 with a third brother to export flax to London for textiles. <italic>Stiglitz</italic>\u2019s co-founder, Peter Klein, had married a Christian <italic>Mahs</italic> of Hamburg and Saint-Petersburg.\nAfter resuming construction of the Port of Odessa in the Black Sea, Russia exempted all imports from taxes and, following lobbying from Greek merchants, declared her a free port. Led by a Frenchmen, Odessa soon attracted French and Greek investment. With settlement facilitated by Prince Gregory Potemkin after the <italic>Russo-Turkish War</italic> (1768-1774). Potemkin\u2019s policy allowed Jews, previously banned from Russia until 1772, to settle in Odessa. The community quickly established a cemetery in 1793, a charitable brotherhood in 1795, and a formal community in 1798, with the main synagogue on Jewish Street. \nOdessa\u2019s Jewish community, founded in 1798, was a newcomer compared to the long-established Jewish centers in the Polish-Lithuania, such as Wilna, Minsk, and Volozhin, and thousands of tiny shtetls ruled by Hasidic courts, like as Liady, Lubavitch, and Chernobyl. Without \u2018native\u2019 Jewish traditions, Galician Jewry brought the Haskalah to Odessa without local opposition. So, instead of traditional Jewish learning, the Port Jewry of Odessa functioned as a kind of \u2018anti-shtetl.\u2019 Attracting modern Jewish intellectuals, Odessa\u2019s thriving grain trade led to a diverse Jewish population involved in various economic roles. \nSince Tsarina Catherine II granted the Rafalovich surname to Moshe Pernas in 1783, his sons Kalman and Solomon expanded to Nikolayev, Mogilev, and Tarnopol, while Abraham banked and traded grain in the newly founded Odessa. As Hasidism spread, Abraham Rafalovich adopted it. So did Berdichev, the once Radziwill-owned fair town that competed with Odessa for trade, like Orla did with Bialystok, where Jews gained permission to live on the Polish-Belarus border. \nTogether with the <italic>Pale</italic> cities of Grodno, Wilna, Shklov, and Bialystok, Berdichev played a pivotal role in trade and banking. By the 1810s, Abraham Rafalovich married his cousin Olga Lowensohn, of a rabbinical family including child prodigy Isaac Levinsohn. Along with Mark Gunzburg, Levinsohn was considered \u2018Russian Mendelssohn\u2019 and the founder of the Haskalah in Russia. They continued marrying one-another.\nAmong the most prominent Berdichev pioneers was Israel Friedman, Hasidic royalty though his Baal Shem-Tov disciple forefathers Maggid of Mezhirech and the Katz-descendant Chief Rabbi of Chernobyl Nahum Twersky, who established Hasidic dynasties in Ukrainian shtetls. So did their in-laws, including Friedman\u2019s uncle-in-laws, possibly descendants of Samson Wertheim, who established dynasties near Odessa and in Moldova. After marrying a fellow Katz-descendant of Habsburg Emperor Rudolf II\u2019s Mint Jew Mark Meisel\u2014in 1810, Friedman arrived in Berdichev in 1813 and joined the Second Merchants\u2019 Guild. As his wealth grew, so did his messianic aura and international followers after he became the Rabbi of Ruzhin. \nLong before Friedman caught the ire of the authorities, Russia imprisoned the founder of Chabad Hasidism, Schneur Zalman, in 1800 until his disciple Beinish Lapkovsky, the grandson of the head of the Witebsk kahal and a member of the Third Merchants\u2019 Guild, secured his release from Saint-Petersburg. When Zalman was imprisoned again the following year, Lords\u2019 Jew Natan Nota freed him, and Zalman fled Russia. After Lapkovsky battled the French in Witebsk during the war in 1812, he was appointed alongside the Polish mayor in 1814. From 1819, Lapkovsky served as a Jewish deputy in Saint-Petersburg. \nBanker Jacob Halpern of Berdichev also supported Hasidism. While Halpern\u2019s daughters married into the Katz family, his sons expanded their banking from Berdichev to Odessa. South of Berdichev in Shargorod, a thriving Jewish trade hub in Podolia and an important center of early Hasidism, David Herzenstein was responsible for foreign trade as the merchant of the First Guild and Rabbi of Shargorod by the turn of the century, before moving to Odessa. \nIn 1819, Herzenstein\u2019s daughter married a son of Hirsch Halberstam, from a rabbinical family of Brody connected to Katz and Zevi Ashkenasy descendants. Halberstam formed Brody private bank <italic>Halberstam Nirenstein</italic><italic> </italic>to trade across Austria, Russia, and Turkey, with his father-in-law, Mendel Nirenstein, related to the Bernstein, Landau, and Nathansohn families. Halberstam\u2019s other daughter, in 1817, married a son of Majer Mises, whose father traced his lineage to Czy\u017cykow leaseholders and was a cloth wholesaler and real estate owner in Lemberg, trading between Galicia, Austria, and Russia. \nBack in 1814, Halberstam\u2019s nephew married a daughter of  Zelman Bornstein and a wealthy heiress of Liczki. Another of Bornstein\u2019s daughters married Ber Meisel\u2014a descendant of Court Jew Meisel and Katz\u2014whose sister married a Warsaw banker Zbytkower\u2019s daughter-in-law\u2019s brother. Bornstein soon managed Krakau salt mines with the Zbytkowers.\nIn Lemberg and Letichev, between Berdichev and Shargorod, the Rappaports, descended from Zevi Ashkenasy and cousins of Halpern, served as rabbis and kinterlinked with the Brody merchant Byks. East of Shargorod in Uman, Nahman Rapoport\u2014who married Jacob Halpern\u2019s extended cousin\u2014joined his sons-in-law, Rabbi of Prague Ezekiel Landau\u2019s grandson Moses and wealthy lumber merchant Haykl Hurwitz, by the turn of the century, to battle Hasidism. Rapoport\u2019s sister-in-law, meanwhile, was a grandmother of  Katz-descendant David Horowitz, who wed a daughter of Rabbi Eleasar Kallir by 1805. Eleasar\u2019s son Alex became a merchant in Brody. Another descendant of Rapoport\u2019s sister-in-law, a Miesel and Katz-descendant, left Brody for Zlatopol, further east of Uman, where he adopted the name Mayer Brodsky, where he built his wealth. \nHowever, continued note inflation led Russia to ban Jews from exporting silver and copper by 1809. As Russia paid foreign loans via <italic>Stiglitz </italic>in 1809, notes continued depreciating, rising from 202 in 1808 to 423 by 1812. While one of Stiglitz brothers had lived in Ukrainian Kherson, he partnered with Abram Peretz, who had married the daughter of deceased Prince Potemkin\u2019s Court Advisor Joshua Zeitlin and moved to Saint-Petersburg to build ships. Peretz converted in 1813, as the brothers of <italic>Stiglitz</italic> Saint-Petersburg converted and married aristocrats by 1812. While his brother joined the <italic>Finance Ministry</italic>, Ludwig developed <italic>Stiglitz</italic>. \nWith <italic>Stiglitz</italic>\u2019s most serious competitor, <italic>Rall Severin</italic>, ruined in 1817, Ludwig gained influence at <italic>Saint-Petersburg Stock Exchange</italic>. By 1826, he became a baron, privy councilor, and Court Banker as Director of <italic>Imperial Commercial Bank</italic> monopoly. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> engaged <italic>Gasser</italic> to trade tobacco and sugar from 1818, they switched to <italic>Stiglitz</italic> from 1825. By 1827, Ludwig co-founded Saint-Petersburg\u2019s <italic>First Russian First Insurance</italic>. \nAlthough Stiglitz had left the Kherson, the port became a provincial center with growing trade, attracting Abraham Rafalovich in the 1830s. Through the 1820s, the Admiralty and shipyard attracted merchants, including Markus Warshavsky, who later supplied provisions, timber, firewood, boards, and built shipyards in Kherson and Nikolaev and producing vessels like gunboats. By 1825, Borukh Halpern was among the few Jews maintaining merchant status, supplying provisions and timber alongside Favel Isakov.\nAs Stiglitz married into Russian aristocracy, they blocked <italic>Rothschild</italic> Saint-Petersburg from forming. Instead, <italic>Stiglitz</italic> retained the Hanseatic <italic>Mahs</italic> of Hamburg and Saint-Petersburg. Since Ludwig founded <italic>Stiglitz</italic> with Peter Klein, Klein\u2019s nephew Ernst Mahs married into <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic><italic> </italic>in 1817, becoming the Saint-Petersburg grain agent for <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>. While Klein retired in 1827, his son Karl Mahs Klein married the converted noble Amalia Seligmann H\u00f6nig in 1828 and ran <italic>Stiglitz</italic> Saint-Petersburg.\nLike <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> and other North German Lutherans, the Schepeler family of Munden leveraged the city\u2019s strategic location at the confluence of the Werra, Fulda, and Weser rivers for robust trade. Continuing the tradition of maritime trades, Andreas Schepeler\u2019s son apprenticed in trade in Bremen, establishing permanent residency there from 1760. \nBy 1800, Andreas\u2019 son Johann relocated to Frankfurt, where he married the daughter of merchant and councilor, concurrently becoming a partner in his business. From 1822, Johann\u2019s nephew become a merchant in Russian Riga and soon a hereditary honorary citizen. Having kinterlinked with fellow Lutheran Frankfurt banker <italic>Metzler</italic> in the 1770s, a <italic>Bethmann</italic> heir linked with Lutheran <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s in-law Huguenot Pierre Labouchere of <italic>Hope</italic> by marrying his cousin once remove Louise Boode in 1810. \nSince widow Anna Swarth Insinger took charge of Amsterdam bank <italic>Insinger</italic>, her son Frederik joined. While Herman Tjeenk, a vicar\u2019s son, worked at his uncle\u2019s Amsterdam commission house, which he took over in 1806, he died in 1810. His widow, Joannam became guardian of their four children and partnered with PW Scholten to form <italic>Widow Tjeenk</italic> in 1811. Joanna provided the capital, and Scholten became the Managing Partner. And in 1813, the <italic>Baring</italic>-affiliated <italic>Hope</italic> fully reponed in Amsterdam under the leadership of in-law Pierre Labouchere.\nBy then, <italic>Hope</italic>\u2019s underwriter <italic>Borski</italic> was one of Amsterdam\u2019s wealthiest bankers. As Russia stopped paying loan interest, Borski went to Russia with Labouchere to negotiate terms in 1813. Dying upon his return, his possibly Mennonite widow Johanna Velde took charge. She took over the business as <italic>Widow Borski</italic>, continued managing two trust offices, and became the majority shareholder of <italic>Associatie Cassa</italic>. As Amsterdam barred women from the exchange, Johanna was the sole broker to work from home and lead her household for decades. \nIn 1814, King Willem founded <italic>Nederlandsche Bank</italic> to replace the pre-war central bank, <italic>Bank of Amsterdam</italic>. As investors were reluctant to buy 40% of <italic>Nederlandsche </italic>debt, Borski bought it. From 1819, she sent her son Willem II to train at <italic>Baring</italic> in London. The following year, Willem married Louise Boode\u2019s sister\u2014kinterlinking with Labouchere, <italic>Bethmann</italic>, and <italic>Metzler</italic> of Frankfurt\u2014and returned to Amsterdam as a junior partner. Other bankers also entered Amsterdam. After Sephardi Teixeira were elevated to nobility in 1818 by King Willem, the descendants of Court Jews and cousins of Mendes and DaCosta formed <italic>Teixeira</italic> private bank in Amsterdam in 1822. \nMinorities dominated Dutch colonial endeavors. While Mennonite made up less than 2% of the population, <italic>Nederlandsche </italic>had two Mennonite directors. Since Mennonite grain trader Abraham Fock married co-religionist Cornelia Clercq in 1759, their son, Jacob, co-founded and became the first President of <italic>Nederlandsche</italic>. Likewise, Jacob\u2019s son presided over <italic>Nederlandsche</italic> from 1844. Cornelia\u2019s cousin married Jan Eeghen in 1750 and their son, Christian, wed Cornelia\u2019s daughter in 1781. Christian co-founded a shipping, banking, and trade firm in 1778. Alongside <italic>Cazenove</italic>, Christian directed land company <italic>Holland Land Co</italic> in the 1790s. Christian\u2019s grandnephew presided over <italic>Nederlandsche</italic> in 1864. \nWhile Cornelia\u2019s cousin twice removed Maria Clercq married a co-religionist <italic>Holland Land Co</italic> co-founder TenCate\u2014related to the textile bankers Blijdenstein of Twente\u2014Maria\u2019s brother Willem directed <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> from 1833.  Like Willem Clercq in 1818, his sister and cousin wed the children of Dani\u00ebl Boissevain, who had formed shipping and trade company <italic>Boissevain </italic>in 1795. \nAfter Boissevain\u2019s son kinterlinked with <italic>Stiglitz</italic>\u2019s London agent by marrying Caroline Mollet in 1833, Willem Clercq\u2019s son later married Caroline\u2019s niece and directed <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>. <italic>Boissevain</italic> collaborated with converted Sephardi<italic> Teixeira</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic>\u2019s Amsterdam agent. In 1838, Teixeira\u2019s in-law Elisabeth Mendes married Josef Cah\u00e9n, a brother of <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic>\u2019s in-law Antwerp banker Joseph Cah\u00e9n, who opened <italic>Cah\u00e9n</italic> Amsterdam. \nBetween 1823 and 1830, <italic>Insinger</italic> heirs kinterlinked with Borski and Labouchere. Since a Dutch <italic>Borski</italic> heir married Louise Boode\u2019s sister\u2014kinterlinking with Labouchere, <italic>Bethmann</italic>, and <italic>Metzler</italic> of Frankfurt\u2014in 1820, one of Hamburg-born <italic>Hope</italic> partner Hieronimus Sillem\u2019s daughters married a Swiss Cazanove-cousin Odier in 1823, her sister married a <italic>Borski</italic> heir. \nBy 1839, Labouchere\u2019s nephew married with a Mallet of the BDF Regency. Over time, Johanna reduced her involvement, and in 1832, Willem II took over the day-to-day operations. After supporting <italic>Netherlands Trading Society </italic>with favorable terms in 1840, she tired in 1844. Upon her death two years later, Willem increasingly invested in American railroads, to the detriment of the firm. Descendants <italic>Baring</italic> and Labouchere led until the 1930s.\nMeanwhile, the Reid family traded in the West Indies. Since Thomas Reid expanded operations to the East Indies, he became an EIC director from 1803, and chair in 1816 and 1821. After joining <italic>Reid</italic> in around 1790, Thomas\u2019 nephew John Irving became a Partner and formed <italic>Reid Irving</italic> as he became Member of Parliament from 1806 until his death in 1845. During the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, <italic>Reid Irving</italic> joined <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Hope</italic> in negotiating triangular loans involving exports from Brazilin dyewood and diamonds and Mexican silver (with French financier<italic> </italic>Gabriel<italic> </italic>Ouvrard) to Britain for EIC and supplied armies in Spain and Russia from 1811.<italic> </italic>\n<italic>Reid Irving</italic> partnered in London with the Gladstones and <italic>Thomson Bonar </italic>to ship Baltic grain to Liverpool.<italic></italic> With wealth from trading transatlantic corn and tobacco trade their West Indies sugar plantations, the Gladstones partnered with cousin-in-law Gillanders and Ogilvy to form <italic>Gladstone Gillanders Ogilvy</italic> in Calcutta by 1825 as Scots led EIC\u2019s trade across Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia.\nSince the British occupied Cura\u00e7ao from 1807 through the Napoleonic Wars until the <italic>Congress of Vienna</italic> returned them to the Dutch in 1816. Having lost trade to the Danish Antilles of Saint-Thomas, Dutch efforts to revive trade faltered in the largest Jewish settlement south of America. While Dutch Jews achieved legal equality after Napoleon invaded in 1796, those in Cura\u00e7ao waited until 1825. Black slaves had to endure until 1863 for their emancipation.\nA year after the Dutch allowed and subsidized the private <italic>Javasche</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> in the East Indies, Jews also financed the government-run <italic>Cura\u00e7aosche Bank</italic> central bank in 1828. Still, Jews mostly borrowed from wealthy Protestants, securing loans with real estate, slaves, or vessels. Of the few Jewish moneylenders were Mordechay Alvares Correa and <italic>Manuel DaCosta Gomez</italic>. By 1837, Seixas and Cardozo cousin-in-law Rabbi Solomon Levy Maduro founded <italic>Maduro</italic>, later diversifying into banking and shipping Venezuelan cacao and tobacco.\nEarlier, Simon Bol\u00edvar was born in Caracas to wealthy cacao-planting aristocrats. In 1804, he traveled to Europe, where he witnessed the <italic>French Revolution</italic> and Napoleon\u2019s rise. Bol\u00edvar returned to Venezuela in 1810 and joined the independence movement against Spanish rule, declaring himself \u201cEl Libertador\u201d after retaking Caracas in 1813. However, royalist forces regained control in 1814, forcing Bol\u00edvar to flee to Jamaica and later New Granada in 1816. \nBy 1823, Bol\u00edvar focused on Peru, arriving during a critical phase of the revolution. He achieved a decisive victory in 1824, which ended Spanish colonial rule in Peru and led to the establishment of Bolivia in 1825. Despite these successes, Bol\u00edvar faced challenges in uniting the newly independent nations. His efforts at the Congress of American Republics in Panama in 1826 received limited support. Political strife led him to resign from power in 1830, and he died shortly after.\nThrough the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, Spanish merchant-speculators, like Basque-born Antonio Bassoco, amassed fortunes. Their ventures encompassed diverse investments ranging from the China and Philippine trades to mining, public funds, livestock, and plantations. Despite the undulating tides of the economy, their endeavors have etched a lasting imprint upon the financial landscape of New Spain. Over the course of centuries marked by intermarriage, most of Mexico\u2019s nobility had evolved into a distinct lineage by the time of Mexico\u2019s declaration of independence from Spain in 1821. Adorned with titles and privileges, this interwoven network of families wielded sway over governance, mining, and financial affairs.\nBasque intermarriage networks were crucial in integrating public and private credit and industry. This blending of interests was evident across Spanish America. Families used urban and rural resources, solidifying networks through marriage. Even after gaining independence from Spain, these networks persisted, connecting old and new elite families through marriages and business collaborations. \nIn 1828, Argentina\u2019s first public bank was formed, <italic>Banco de la Provincia</italic>, formed in Buenos Aires. A large percentage of subscribers were Casares and other second-generation Basque descendants. They later assumed leadership roles. Among the wealthiest subscribers to <italic>Banco de la Provincia</italic>, most came from colonial merchants and marriages. Casares and his cousins later co-founded the first railroad.\nLikewise, Argentine aristocracy kinterlinked with German Lutherans. While his brother remained in Westphalia, becoming a Lutheran pastor and marrying a Krupp, and Johann Bunge founded <italic>Bunge</italic> in Amsterdam in 1818 to trade Dutch colonial goods. Likewise, Lynch Zimmermann founded <italic>Zimmermann</italic>. By 1822, <italic>Discount Bank of Buenos Aires</italic> formed with Sebastian Lezica as a director. In 1824, <italic>Zimmermann Frazier</italic> succeeded <italic>Zimmermann</italic> to trade Argentine wool trade with Continental markets. Although Lezica rivaled <italic>Zimmermann</italic> connections, his cousin married Johann Bunge\u2019s nephew Carlos by 1831. As <italic>Bunge</italic> dominated the Argentine trade, Carlos served as Consul General of Prussia and the Netherlands.\nImmigrating from Ireland to Baltimore, Alex Brown opened a trading firm in Baltimore in 1800. Along with sending his sons to Liverpool in 1810, Philadelphia in 1818, and New York in 1825, the family partnered with Quaker Joseph Shipley in London, soon creating <italic>Brown</italic> <italic>Shipley</italic>. In 1831, Brown co-founded <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> with the Unitarian cotton broker <italic>Holt</italic>. While <italic>Brown</italic>\u2019s James Brown had married the daughter of a minister\u2019s daughter, she died in 1829. By 1831, he married the daughter of a clergyman of the Dutch Reformed Church in Troy, New York. His daughter later married Howard Potter, whose father and brother became the bishops of Pennsylvania and New York in later years.\nAs BOE regulated joint-stock banks, only MMBU brokering merchant banks led BOE to promote trade over inflation. Without paying gold, the banks funded trade. Along with <italic>Reid Irving </italic>and other Scots, <italic>Barclay</italic> and <italic>Lloyd</italic> merchant banks and insurer funded trade, Quakers dominated domestic banking. As the Navy reneged on timber contracts, war disrupted imports, and Parliament tariffed steel. So, banks financed coal. \nMeanwhile, whale oil faced competition. After William Murdoch demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing coal gas for illumination in 1792, Baltimore and Richmond demonstrated gas lighting in 1802 and 1803. Meanwhile, in London, coal-based gas <italic>public utilities</italic> (\u201cPUs\u201d) took shape with the incorporation of the first <italic>London Gas Co</italic> in 1810 and <italic>City of London Gas Light & Coke Co</italic> in 1817. \nAs cotton mills of Newport, Rhode Island, illuminated by 1817, American cities chartered <italic>Gas Light Co</italic> of Baltimore in 1816, followed by <italic>Boston Gas Light</italic> <italic>Co</italic> in 1822, and <italic>New York Gas Light Co</italic> in 1825. While Jewish farmers in Boryslaw of Austrian Galicia extracted crude oil to lubricate wagon wheels by the 1770s, oversupply after the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> in 1815 prompted Boryslaw Jews to produce oil for light. With licenses from Vienna and Prague, they illuminated the streets around Boryslaw by 1817. \nBy 1819, BOE made banks resume <italic>pound</italic> gold payouts. Deflation spread business failures and accelerated capitalism. As <italic>Bank of Ireland</italic>, under the governorship of brewer Arthur Guinness, rescued <italic>Touche</italic> and other Dublin private banks during the <italic>Panic of </italic><italic>1820</italic>, banking crisis, reforms allowed bankers outside of the capital to have more than six shareholders. \nThat year, <italic>Reid Irving</italic>\u2019s John Reid joined BOE as a director, which he remained on for decades, continuing to participate in foreign loans with <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, and <italic>Hope.</italic> As <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic> resumed her gold brokering monopoly for servicing BOE,<italic> Rothschild</italic> repaid her gold loan to the heirs of the Landgrave of Hesse since 1823. Through the panic, bankers and <italic>trusts</italic> replaced whale oil by funding coal-based gas PUs for street lights and Spanish American mines. \nBut as the <italic>Master & Servant Act</italic> of 1823 criminalized broken labor contracts, courts imprisoned miners. So, Parliament<italic> </italic>legalized labor unions, lowered tariffs, and ended monopoly from 1720. Unions combined with judicial refusal to aid trusts into the <italic>Panic of 1825</italic>. Amidst bank failures and strikes, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s loan allowed BOE to avoid suspension. Trade fell as BOE hiked rates. So, Parliament banned unions, repealed the <italic>Bubbles Act</italic>, and eased the <italic>Navigation Acts</italic>. Only after this wave of failures did BOE <italic>Birmingham</italic> form in 1827, the first of many branches outside of London. \nIn Austria, <italic>Fries</italic> failed without aid from <italic>Rothschild </italic>Vienna, leading a partner to commit suicide. As<italic> Arnstein Eskeles</italic> took over<italic> Fries</italic>, <italic>Fries</italic> descendants kinterlinked with <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic>\u2019 ennobled converted descendants of Katz, Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, and Samson Wertheim. And in Bremen, <italic>Meinertzhagen</italic> failed in 1826, forcing Daniel Meinertzhagen to move to London and join <italic>Huth</italic>, where his mother\u2019s contact was a partner. He soon married Huth\u2019s daughter and became a naturalized British subject.\nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1818</italic>, Quaker cartels stabilized coal and steel. But fewer Quakers remained in Britain as more immigrated to America. So did, several Jewish enterprises. As Parliament allowed competition with chartered monopolies of 1720, Moses Montefiore diversified into underwriting. During the boom, Montefiore and Nathan Rothschild challenged <italic>Lloyd</italic> insurer and <italic>Royal Assurance</italic> monopolies, floating <italic>Alliance</italic> <italic>Assurance</italic> with <italic>Overend Gurney</italic>\u2019s Samuel Gurney, <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s Francis Baring, and <italic>Reid Irving\u2019</italic>s John Irving. \nAlso in 1824, Montefiore and Isaac Goldsmid joined Matthias Attwood\u2014of <italic>Attwood Spooner</italic> with <italic>Smyth</italic>-in-law\u2014to fund <italic>Imperial Continental Gas Association</italic> (\u201cICGA\u201d). While ICGA challenged local authorities for prices or municipal ownership of coal-gas distribution, ICGA illuminated the streets of Berlin, Amsterdam, Hanover, and Ghent by 1828. \nMoses Montefiore joined Matthias Attwood, Robert Campbell, Edward Blount, and others to found Britain\u2019s first colonial bank, the Catholic <italic>Provincial Bank of Ireland</italic>, in 1825, for which <italic>Touche</italic> acted as Dublin agents after a legal battle with <italic>Bank of Ireland</italic>,<italic> </italic>where the directing Guinness cousins formed bank <italic>Guinness Mahon</italic>. Moses\u2019 brother Joseph moved to Australia with his wife Sarah Mocatta and their family by 1828. The same syndicate decided to invest in pastureland in Australia. In 1833, rumors of <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and <italic>Baring</italic> entering the Australian banking sector failed to materialize for years. Also in 1828, Rebecca Mocatta\u2019s cousin Sarah married gold and silver refiner <italic>Rapha\u00ebl</italic>, strengthening <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic>\u2019s gold dealing monopoly with BOE. \nSince Lion Goldsmid of London married Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Hertz\u2014whose uncle Hamburg banker Jacob Hertz had married Fanny Bacher, a second great-granddaughter of Samuel Oppenheim and niece of Moses Mendelssohn through his wife, Frumet Guggenheim\u2014her niece wed Carl Rothschild in 1818. Along with a Hertz in-law at <italic>Goldsmid</italic>, Lion Goldsmid bought Mexican bonds at a 50% basis and pledging Mexico\u2019s revenues as collateral by 1824. \nAs <italic>Goldsmid</italic> filed for bankruptcy in early 1826, trustees included representatives from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Samuel</italic>, <italic>Overend Gurney</italic>, and <italic>Barclay Herring Richardson</italic>. But as <italic>Barclay Herring Richardson</italic> also failed, <italic>Baring</italic> took over Mexico\u2019s financial agency by late 1826. Subsequently, revolts against the federal government erupted in 1827, starting in Vera Cruz and spreading to Puebla.\nRetiring from <italic>Rothschild</italic> business in 1824, Moses Montefiore dedicated himself to ICGA and serving Jews. After Queen Victoria knighted him, Moses became Britain\u2019s first Jewish knight (although his great-granduncle Medina was England\u2019s first), and soon London\u2019s second Jewish Sheriff in 1837. Although Moses had no children, his brother\u2019s daughter married a Katz-Samuel descendant in 1850. Asher Goldsmid, the co-founder of <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic> and uncle of ICGA co-founder Isaac, became Britain\u2019s first Jewish baronet in 1841.\nA year before Moses Montefiore\u2019s sister Rebecca wed Joseph Salomons\u2014son of a Anglo-Dutch banker and nephew-in-law of the former head of <italic>Hambros Synagogue</italic> Gomperz\u2014in 1824, Joseph\u2019s brother David married Katz-descendant Jeannette Samuel Cohen-Barent. By 1826, successfully David advocated for government permission for non-issuing joint-stock banks to operate beyond a 65-mile radius from London. After Salomons co-founded <italic>Westminster Bank</italic> alongside James Gilbart in 1832, Parliament broke the monopoly of private banks in London, allowing non-issuing joint-stock banks to enter London. While Gilbart became the bank\u2019s inaugural General Manager, Salomons served as a director and later Chair. In 1836, Emmanuel Cooper, a Quaker and anti-slavery activist who worked with <italic>Smyth</italic> cousin William Wilberforce, co-founded the joint-stock <italic>Surrey, Kent & Sussex Bank</italic>\u2014which soon changed her name to <italic>London & County Bank</italic>\u2014, and served as her Chair.\nSince the retirement of Montefiore, <italic>Rothschild</italic> retained <italic>Cazenove</italic> and <italic>Wagg</italic> as stockbrokers. With a reputation harkening back to the <italic>Panic of 1720</italic>, Waggs were cousins of the Katz, Hart, Hendricks, and Oppenheim families of Britain. After John Wagg\u2019s uncle married Montefiore\u2019s sister-in-law and aunt married Alex Goldsmid by the 1810s, he started <italic>Wagg</italic> in 1823. By 1836, John Wagg married Montefiore\u2019s niece, who was the daughter of Katz descendant Hannah Samuel and Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s son.\nOn the Continent, joint-stock banks remained a rarity. When six prominent and mostly Christian private banks of Frankfurt\u2014including <italic>Bethmann</italic>, <italic>Bonn</italic>, <italic>Brentano</italic>, <italic>Gontard</italic>, <italic>Grunelius</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt\u2014jointly applied to establish a joint-stock bank in 1825 to address the city\u2019s cash scarcity issues and serve as a clearing house, facilitate bill discounting, and offer lending services, supported by gold, silver, and securities. Despite the proposal\u2019s details, Frankfurt\u2019s guilds and authorities continued to reject such banks without free trade or Jewish political rights, like in much of Germany until the 1860s. Without the forced industrialization in the Prussian Rhineland, Saxony, and Silesia, Frankfurt remained pre-modern.\nBy 1835, David Salomons was London\u2019s first Jewish Sheriff. David\u2019s cousin Phillip married Jeannette\u2019s cousin Cecilia Katz-Samuel by 1837. A year later, David and Montefiore became the first Jewish magistrates. Before David Salomons became the first Jewish Mayor of London in 1855, he was elected to Parliament in 1851 but could not serve until 1859 due a requirement for a Christian oath. Although David did not have children, his brother Joseph\u2019s three daughters married Cohen-Barent, Goldsmid, and Jacob Waley. While Jacob Waley became one of the first Jews to become a lawyer, his brother Simon became a prominent stockbroker and elected member of <italic>London Stock Exchange Committee</italic> and married Anna, the daughter of Phillip and Cecilia in 1859. (Following the death of his wife, David Salomons married Anna\u2019s sister.)\nBefore marrying Phillip Salomons, Cecilia Katz-Samuel was the widow of another Salomons, of unknown connection, but related to <italic>Isaac</italic> <italic>Campbell</italic>, who parlayed cloth profits into the largest Jewish arms dealer. Samuel Isaac, born in Chatham, started as a clothier for soldiers and sailors. In 1852, he founded <italic>Isaac Campbell</italic> with support from Dugald Campbell\u2014of the West Indies Scottish Campbell family\u2014to supply militaries during the <italic>Crimean War</italic> and subsequent conflicts. By 1856, the firm had secured contracts to outfit British troops during the <italic>Indian Mutiny</italic> and <italic>Second Opium War</italic>, and supplied boots to the Weedon army.\nSince his cousin kinterlinked with Court Jew of Morocco Guedalla in 1811, Montefiore\u2019s exit from trade created opportunities. In 1841, David Salomons\u2019 first cousin via his Gomperz aunt married Juda Pariente, a Sephardi descendant of the Court Jews of Morocco. By 1844, his brother Moses founded <italic>Pariente Bank</italic> in Tangier, serving the British Legation at Tangier and British contractors supplying provisions to the garrison at Gibraltar for three decades. By 1845, another brother, Isaac Pariente, established himself as a merchant in Manchester, trading with Morocco, Gibraltar, Malta, and Constantinople.\nMeanwhile, Katz-centralized formal religious leadership of British Jewry across the colonies emerged for the first time. Since Rabbi Hirschel Levin soon resigned amidst a scandal in 1764, David Schiff of Frankfort became Rabbi of <italic>Great Synagogue</italic> upon Goldsmid\u2019s recommendation. While the non-Katz-descendant Schiff styled himself the Chief Rabbi of London and the Provinces, he faced opposition from Levin\u2019s Katz-descendant cousin Meshullam Zalman, who became Rabbi of <italic>Hambros</italic>. However, criticism forced Zalman to resign by 1780, and Schiff held the Chief Rabbinate unopposed for the last decade of his life. After Schiff and Zalman died in the 1790s, the post remained vacant until former Chief Rabbi Levin\u2019s son Solomon Hirschell took over from 1802 through the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> until his death in 1842\nAlthough Hirschell had collaborated with Moses Mendelssohn in translating the bible, Moses Montefiore supported him and Nathan Adler to preserve Orthodox Jewish practice against reformers. David Salomons, however, prioritized legal and political rights, arguing that Orthodoxy hindered inclusivity and acculturation. As the schism within the London community grew, the Rabbinate remained open for three years. Out of 15 candidates, the grandnephew of David Schiff, Nathan Adler of Frankfurt, was elected in 1845. \nWhile Nathan\u2019s paternal grandmother was David\u2019s sister, his mother was Katz-descendant Rebecca Frankel. After marrying Rothschild-in-law and Oppenheim cousin d\u2019Worms, Nathan became the Chief Rabbi of Hanover by 1830. Nathan remained Chief Rabbi of Britain until his death in 1890, when his son Hermann succeeded him as Chief Rabbi. During the 1880s, membership in the Synagogue became more socially significant than as spiritual salvation, yet the influx of Russian Jews later splintered the community.\nSince Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen left Frankfurt, he settled in Saxon Halberstadt as a secondary rabbi in 1780. After beginning lead and copper production from the Harz mountains for nearby breweries in 1795, he bought an idle forge in 1805 to expand.<italic> </italic>So did <italic>Cohen-Barent</italic>, soon moving from Hanover to Frankfurt, and marry-partnering with <italic>Rothschild </italic>in a venture that became <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>. After London-born Ralph Merton came to Frankfurt in 1835, he married the daughter of Phillip Cohen-Barent and joined him at <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>. Of the 356 men who left Frankfurt in the early 19th century, about 32% arrived in France (mainly Paris), 25% in Britain (of which 73% to London), 15% in America (of which 67% to New York), 13% in Antwerp and Amsterdam, 12% in Vienna, and 4% in Italian cities. \nJews also fled Bavaria. After Napoleon\u2019s defeat, Bavaria imposed laws aimed at restricting Jewish rights and opportunities, including special taxes and limitations on professions. While Protected Jews along cattle trade routes could marry and own property, limited availability of the status hindered younger siblings from establishing independent households and families, perpetuating socio-economic marginalization within the Jewish community. While many Bavarian Jews fled for America, The Seligmann and Hirsch-Gereuth (\u201cHirsch\u201d) families thrived. For their services to the state, the Wittelsbacher dynasty ennobled the converted Elias Seligmann as \u2018Eichthal\u2019 in 1814. By 1820, Eichthal sent a son to start a bank in Paris. \nAs 14 Jewish families moved to W\u00fcrzburg and Rabbi Nathan Adler\u2019s disciple became Chief Rabbi in 1814, Jacob Hirsch became a baron in 1819 amidst antisemitic riots in W\u00fcrzburg. As W\u00fcrttemberg ordered supervisory board oversight of <italic>W\u00fcrttemberg Court Bank</italic> in 1817, Chaile Kaulla\u2019s niece married Siegfried Wertheim in 1819 and granddaughter Sara wed Jacob\u2019s son Joel in 1823. After Sara died, Joel wed her sister Caroline. As Jacob Hirsch\u2019s daughter married Chaile\u2019s grandson in 1826, Jacob\u2019s son married Siegfried Wertheim\u2019s first cousin once removed Karoline Wertheim, daughter of a Frankfurt banker, in 1828. When Caroline Kaulla died in 1833, Joel married Karoline\u2019s sister. \nLikewise, W\u00fcrttemberg and other German states bankruptcy and other credit treaties, like before Napoleon. But as rural Germans remained dependent on Jewish credit, antisemitic riots broke out in Baden and Bavaria in 1822 and again 1830. By 1833, Prussia granted citizenship to wealthy and educated Jews outside of Posen. While Bavaria failed to establish a land bank in the 1820s, Hirsch, Eichthal, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, and Wertheim of Munich funded <italic>Bavarian Mortgage & Exchange Bank </italic>after 1835. When Jacob Hirsch died in 1840, his son Joel took over as Bavaria\u2019s Court Jew. \nMore than treaties, marriages of Court Jew and Katz-cousins linked capital across borders. Katz-cousin banker Jakob Kann of Frankfurt\u2014a direct descendant of Samson Wertheim, Lipman Cohen-Behrens, and Elias Gomperz\u2014saw his children marry banker Benedikt Goldschmidt in 1820 and son wedded Regina Goldschmidt in 1829. Other children married Samson Wertheim\u2019s second great-grandson banker Bernhard Wertheim in Vienna in 1829, Behrend Lehmann\u2019s second great-grandson banker Adolf Lehmann in Hanover in 1832, Chaile Kaulla\u2019s granddaughter Rebecca Kaulla of Stuttgart in 1833, and Mayer Rothschild\u2019s grandson banker Salomon Sichel in Amsterdam that same year. And after two of his Kaulla wives died, Madame Kaulla\u2019s son-in-law married a descendant of Lion Halphen Goudchaux in 1823. <italic> </italic>\nIn Saxony, Jewish families controlled nearly all major banks in Dresden, except for <italic>Bassenge</italic> <italic>Fritsch</italic>. One prominent example was <italic>Bondi</italic>, founded by the Saxon Court Jew Simon Bondi in 1755. Since Bondi married a Katz descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, Joseph Goldschmidt, and Lipman Cohen-Behrens, their heirs managed <italic>Bondi</italic>, which financed the wool trade and the emerging textile industry in the Vogtland and Erzgebirge regions by the 1830s.\nSince Austrian banker <italic>Fries</italic> failed in the <italic>Panic of 1825</italic>, the <italic>French Revolution of 1830</italic> spurred the <italic>Panic of 1830</italic>. Unable to access financing, Austria turned to Leo L\u00e4mel. As Louis Haber\u2014whose father was ennobled the prior year\u2014married a niece of L\u00e4mel and Sophie Eichthal, L\u00e4mel\u2019s daughter married Leo Javal of Paris. \nBy then, the L\u00e4mels kinterlinked with the K\u00f6nigswarters of Bohemia, who had entered Israel Popper H\u00f6nig\u2019s 1765 tobacco tax farming syndicate with H\u00f6nig and the Primator of Prague, and  kinterlinked with an Arnstein Oppenheim Hirschels and the Primator\u2019s son. Kinterlinking with Wertheims and Oppenheims, five K\u00f6nigswarter brothers established banks in Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Vienna, and Paris after the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>. \nIn Amsterdam the K\u00f6nigswarters kinterlinked with Abraham Wertheim, a relative of Samson Wertheim, and Leon Gomperz, who descended from Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s nephew Moravia\u2019s Chief Rabbi David\u2014a son of Katz-descendant Blume Wahl\u2014and the daughter of Hannover\u2019s Lipman Cohen-Behrens. After Abraham Wertheim and Leon Gomperz started <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic> in Amsterdam in 1834, a K\u00f6nigswarter became a Controller of <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> from 1838, as another K\u00f6nigswarter wed a Halphen in Paris.\nAlongside Seligmann, Hirsch, Sinzheim, Oppenheim, and other Court Jew entrepreneurs supplying armies and consumers, were the Carlebach family, extended cousins of Rothschild. In the 1810s, Sophie Carlebach married Joseph Belmont. A son of Aaron Belmont\u2014a Kohen who chose the surname following Naploleon\u2019s surname edict, likely in honor of his Sephardi Belmonte ancestors\u2014and Gertrude Lorch, whose father Salomon Lorch was of a Frankfurt family and became the wealthiest Jew of then-French Mainz. \nAfter Aaron Belmont died in 1791, Gertrude married Heyum Hanau, whose sister then married a son of Amschel Rothschild. Joseph Belmont became the richest Jews of Alzey in the Rhine by the 1820s, and soon sent a son, August, to apprentice with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt. Likewise, Sophie\u2019s sister married Joseph\u2019s cousin, Bernard Belmont Reinach, whose family kinterlinked with the Rindskopf and May families of Frankfurt in 1804\u2014and so linked with the Rothschilds\u2014they became bankers in Paris, while Carlebach formed a rabbinical and banking dynasty in L\u00fcbeck. \nAfter Joseph Speyer, brother of Imperial Court Jew Isaac Speyer, inherited his father-in-law David Ellissen\u2019s British textile merchant bank (\u201c<italic>Speyer</italic> Frankfurt\u201d) in 1818, a Speyer cousin married Amalia Goldschmidt Weisweiller and Amalia\u2019s brother David married Ellissen\u2019s daughter in 1836. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> London provided a loan to the Spanish Government for a monopoly of <italic>Almad\u00e9n</italic> mercury in 1835, Nathan Rothschild left Daniel Weisweiller as the family\u2019s Spanish agent. Along with French monopoly rights for Russia\u2019s <italic>Demidov</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> dominate European sales of substance for refining precious metals. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> extended a loan to Portugal through a Spanish Mendes cousin in 1835, political reasons compelled the latter to flee to London.\nLike Sina from Turkish Greece after Austrian free trade, migration from less developed to wealthier regions of the Austrian empire grew. With the industrial development of the Vienna area and the construction of railways in the 1820s, Jewish merchants from Bohemia and Moravia migrated to Milan, selling commercial textiles to northern Italian markets. Although Jews accounted for one out of every 250 Milanese, they made up one in three bankers there in the 1830s. But Austria continued to prohibit Hungarian credit, with tobacco processing Court Jew descendant Moritz Ulman lobbying for a bank in Pest. While he converted to Christianity in the 1820s and later divorced his Jewish wife and married a Fugger descendant, Ulman waited almost a decade for the bank.\nWhile one of Moritz Ulman\u2019s sisters married the son of a Schlesinger and descendant of the Mandl Prefects of Hungarian Jews, another sister married Leon Pollak, a son of a Pressburg merchant, who established a successful wholesale trading business in Pest in the 1830s. Leon\u2019s brother Heinrich moved to Vienna in the 1820s and worked for his father-in-law, Salomon Preisach. While his uncle married a Mandl descendant, Preisach\u2019s aunt had married a brother of <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic>\u2019 Nathan Arnstein. After Preisach\u2019s bankruptcy, Heinrich formed <italic>Preisach Pollak</italic>, focusing on leather trade. By the 1840s, his leather factory in Rodaun became one of the largest in Lower Austria. Likewise, Leon\u2019s niece married a Latzko, descended from Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and Katz, in 1837.\nUnder French occupation and British blockade, the Free Port of Trieste withered. After returning, Austrians restored the free port and made Trieste a free city of the German Confederation. Jews thrived in Trieste, which became the insurance capital of the Mediterranean and central Europe with <italic>Morpurgo</italic>. As Turkey was neutral during the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, Greek traders transported grain from Odessa across the Mediterranean\u2019s free trade ports, such as Livorno and Trieste, out to London. \nAmong the other cities Morpurgo kinterlinked with was Turkish Salonica, where Anna Morpurgo married Lazaro Allatini, a Sephardi from a family of rabbis and doctors that moved from Livorno. From 1836, <italic>Allatini</italic> engaged in wheat trade, shipping, and insurance, and expanded into industries including a flourmill, a tile and brick factory, and a tobacco factory.  \nAs Greeks revolted against Turkey for Christian sovereignty in 1822, armed Samians attacked Chios, sparking conflict. The Ottoman Empire responded with a fleet and thousands of Turkish fighters, framing the conflict as a holy war, like the Greek rebels. ,After the crisis, Chiots and other Greeks, including <italic>Rodocanachi</italic>, descended from the Imperial Byzantine Palaiologos family, who kinterlinked with <italic>Ralli</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Mavrogordatos</italic>, and joined <italic>Ionid</italic><italic>e</italic><italic>s</italic>, <italic>Schilizzi</italic>, and traders in Constantinople, Izmir, London, France, and Austrian Trieste, where <italic>Ralli</italic> co-founded <italic>Adriatico Banco</italic> in 1826. Within a year, Ralli branched to Odessa and beyond. \nAs the Ionian Islands had been British since 1815, those families that gained access to BOE had an advantage in the Odessa grain trade. Ionides, for example, formed<italic> </italic><italic>Discount Bank</italic> in London in 1833. However, France lacked MMBU without <italic>Baring</italic><italic></italic><italic></italic>-like merchant banks. Greek shippers soon relied on <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> <italic>Goldschmidt</italic> and <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne for French grain credit.<italic></italic>\n<italic>North & West Europ</italic><italic>ean Panics of Industrialization</italic>\nAlthough Barrois, Champagne, and Luxembourg had strong metallurgical industries, neighboring Lorraine had only a few iron forges. The Nancy basin had no active forges. In the south, Cirey-sur-Vezouze and Pexonne were supplied by local mines. To the north, Longuyon and Villers-la-Montagne had blast furnaces and forges. \nWhile metallurgy enabled Jacques Contenot, who acquired Montreuil-sur-Blaise and a forge in 1745, to gain wealth and noble status before abandoning industry. Similarly, the Anth\u00e8s metallurgists in Upper Alsace were ennobled in 1733 after shifting to law. Protestants like the Dietrichs and Wendels remained among the few industrialists.\nThe Huguenot Dietrich had fled Lorraine for Strasbourg in the 16th century. In 1684, Jean Dietrich, a Lutheran banker, purchased the Jaegerthal forge, marking the family\u2019s transition to ironmaking. Under Jean III (1719-1795), who renounced banking to focus on metallurgy, <italic>Dietrich</italic> expanded significantly. Jean acquired the Zinswiller foundry and built new plants and blast furnaces in Niederbronn, Reichshoffen, and Rauschendwasser. \nThe family was ennobled by both Louis XVI in France and the German Emperor Francis Habsburg in the 1760s. Inheriting <italic>Dietrich</italic> and becoming the Mayor of Strasbourg, Jean III\u2019s son Frederic supported the <italic>Revolution</italic>\u2014Rouget l\u2019Isle composed the anthem <italic>Marseillaise</italic> in his house\u2014but opposed the Reign of Terror. In 1793, revolutionaries imprisoned and guillotined him and seized his factories. Jean\u2019s sister Am\u00e9lie then inherited <italic>Dietrich</italic>, which her husband managed until his death in 1806, when Am\u00e9lie took over.\nAfter Spain sacked the Protestant stronghold of Antwerp in the late 16th century, Jean Wendel left Bruges and settled in France. His descendant, Jean-Martin became the director of the Ottange forges in 1704. Using advances from Jewish bankers in Metz and Thionville, he acquired the Hayange forges the following year. In 1727, he secured noble status from the Duke of Lorraine. His son, Charles Wendel, expanded the family business in the mid-18th century by leasing the state-owned forges of Creutzwald and Sainte-Fontaine, founding the Hombourg factory, and producing supplies for the royal artillery. By the 1780s, Ignace Wendel, along with British steelmakers, obtained a royal charter for the forges of<italic> Creusot</italic>. \nWhile Ignace\u2019s mother was imprisoned during the <italic>French Revolution</italic>, Ignace was forced into exile. He committed suicide as his family\u2019s assets were nationalized and his nephew was guillotined. Although his mother was released in 1795, she died in 1802, destitute at 82. Since financing <italic>Creusot</italic>, Catholic cloth merchant Claude P\u00e9rier liquidated his bank and was imprisoned in 1793 and freed by his son-in-law. His brother committed suicide in custody, and his widow was murdered. In 1794, P\u00e9rier established a factory to produce arms for the government and paid a forced loan. He later acquired a large stake in <italic>Anzin</italic>, France\u2019s largest enterprise.\nLikewise, the French <italic>Revolution</italic> disrupted charters and guilds. Overturning royal top-soil mining monopoly charters, <italic>Assembly</italic> granted mining rights up to 100 feet to top-soil owners without concessions. While Huguenot funded<italic> </italic>France\u2019s revolutionary regimes, the French <italic>Revolution</italic> ended as General Napoleon Bonaparte seized power in late 1799. Within days, <italic>N\u00e9gociants </italic><italic>R</italic><italic>\u00e9unis</italic>\u2014mostly Catholic financiers and merchants including Claude P\u00e9rier, Florentin Seilli\u00e8re, Gabriel Ouvrard, and Jacques Laffitte\u2014organized <italic>Bank of France</italic> (\u201cBDF\u201d) to support the new regime to not rely on Huguenots. \nWhen Claude P\u00e9rier died in 1801, his son Antoine became a BDF Regent and parlayed <italic>Anzin</italic>\u2019s mining profits to found the Paris bank <italic>P\u00e9rier</italic>. From a Lorraine textile trading family, Florentin Seilli\u00e8re led the management of the Pierrepont factory near Longuyon. In 1789, Seilli\u00e8re obtained a 15-year lease for the Ruelle cannon foundry in Charente. By 1795, he shifted his focus to banking, first in Nancy, and, from 1798, in Paris. Continuing to supply the army, Florentin\u2019s son Nicolas arranged supplier credits, bond loans, and guarantees for military contracts by 1799.\nStill, Swiss <italic>Hentsch</italic> and served as Bonaparte\u2019s payment intermediary, fellow Huguenot <italic>T\u00fcrckheim</italic> returned to bank industry in Strasbourg, and Parisians were satisfied with the existing notarial intermediation system\u2014as opposed to the government issued scrip\u2014and there was little interest in this new governmental bank. So, Napoleon\u2019s <italic>Consulate</italic> delegalized notary intermediation and subsequently granted BDF a note issue monopoly in Paris. During the <italic>Panic of 1803</italic>, the established banking system collapsed, and a crisis erupted by the summer. As France auctioned the Hayange forges, Fran\u00e7ois Wendel returning to Lorraine and bought with credit from <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic>, securing military contracts for axles and cannonballs.\nIn addition to founding BDF, Ouvrard<italic> </italic>supplied Napoleon\u2019s army with food and advanced funds to Spain to fund a debt for equity swap in exchange for specie from the Americas. However, as Napoleon crowned himself Emperor in 1804 and declared war on the Germany, Ouvrard\u2019s gold deal became contested and the <italic>N\u00e9gociants r\u00e9unis</italic>\u2014including BDF and the Treasury\u2014increasingly created credit amongst themselves to finance the war. Although Napoleon succeeded in dissolving Germany, a crisis erupted and bankruptcies accelerated as note holders ran on BDF. Following Ouvrard\u2019s collapse, Napoleon oversaw an authoritarian revision of the <italic>Ordonnance </italic><italic>of 1673 </italic>with the<italic> Commercial Code of 1807</italic>. \nAlthough the drafters wanted to eliminate the <italic>Ordonnance</italic>\u2019s dichotomy between civil-law promissory notes\u2014including bearer bills\u2014and commercial bills of exchange, Napoleon did not want to imprison civil-defaulters and so the distinction was broadened. While default on the former retained assignments for the benefit of creditors<italic> </italic>(<italic>cessios</italic>) and debt stays (<italic>lettres de r\u00e9pit)</italic>, the latter took the opposite approach to end speculation. \nUnlike the <italic>Ordonnance</italic>, the <italic>Code</italic> adopted 18th century jurisprudence to enforce commercial bills of exchange only between trade with distant partners\u2014unlike England, where bills of exchange became bearer credit instruments in 1764. The <italic>Code</italic> also granted the judiciary a monopoly over commercial bankruptcy and subjected failed firms to piecemeal liquidation\u2014abolishing <italic>cessio</italic>s and moratory <italic>lettres</italic>. Moreover the <italic>Code</italic> prohibited nonpossessory secured transactions (chattel mortgages) and reserved the same harsh treatment to brokers as fraudulent bankrupts. As such, separate privileges for bill brokers ended. \nWhile <italic>Creusot</italic> provided munitions, Napoleon developed coal to Saar and Belgium while he blockaded Britain. As BDF Regent<italic> </italic>Claude P\u00e9rier\u2019s <italic>Anzin</italic><italic> </italic>grew larger with Belgian coal mines, he married a Dietrich. Only in 1810 did Napoleon replace the <italic>Assembly</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>1791 preferential mining rights to top-soil owners. Recognizing the top-soil ownership, the 1810 law granted perpetual concessions that could be sold, but not sold in lots or partitioned without prior authorization from the government. \nSince regaining his family\u2019s Hayange forges, Fran\u00e7ois Wendel revived and acquired <italic>Moyeuvre</italic> forges in 1811 with funding from <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic>. As Napoleon withdrew from Moscow in the winter of 1812, Savva Morozov made weekly journeys, covering 50 miles over two days. His trips during this time earned him a reputation, and after eight years, he had earned enough to buy his family\u2019s freedom. \nAfter the defeat of Napoleon, Austria in the <italic>Congress of Vienna</italic> supported a friendly Bavaria, and loosely confederated north from 1815 with the <italic>Treaty of Chaumont</italic> against a Prussian-led united Germany. In return, France lost most of her coal as Prussia gained the Ruhr, the Dutch fused with Belgium. While BDF Regent Claude P\u00e9rier parlayed <italic>Anzin</italic> profits into his bank, he soon  posted <italic>Anzin</italic> shares as collateral to borrow from <italic>P\u00e9rier</italic>. Since P\u00e9rier married a Dietrich, the Dietrichs kinterlinked with Huguenot banker T\u00fcrckheim in 1818. \nAs Austria\u2019s note-issuing monopoly, <italic>Bank of Vienna</italic>, issued increasing volumes of bearer bonds during the wars, the notes depreciated against silver. In 1811, Austria defaulted on and replaced the notes, leading aristocrat-led <italic>Schwarzenberg</italic> banks to allow her charter to expire. After the war, <italic>Bank of Vienna</italic> defaulted in 1816, and Emperor chartered <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> under the leadership of Bernhard Eskeles with funding from Sina, Swiss <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic>, and <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic> to deflate the issues, monopolizing paper money and discounting bills payable in Vienna. As Austrian bank notes stabilized, Sina\u2019s investments soared in value, and Sina\u2019s son was a director of <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> until his death in 1856. \nAs the Dutch Crown Prince married Tsar Alex\u2019s sister in 1816, <italic>Hope</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, and <italic>Gontard</italic> financed the dowery. From 1817, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, and Huguenot <italic>Gontard</italic> of Frankfurt conveyed the French war indemnity to Prussia, and <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> gained authorization to sign contracts in <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s name, facilitating financing for Prussian subjects\u2019 private claims by the French government. While Britain recovered Hannover as a viceroyalty, EIC vanquished the French from the former Dutch Indies strategic port in 1811 to found Singapore as the British Free Port and base in 1819. And as Britain gained the Ionian Islands, Greek traders increasingly traded Ukrainian grain across the Mediterranean.\nMeanwhile, the <italic>Baring</italic>-affiliated <italic>Hope</italic> reponed in Amsterdam\u2014with Huguenot in-law Pierre Labouchere in charge\u2014they reorganized Austrian debt. The partnership also muscled into France. At the time, French investments were cliquey. For example, BDF Governor Jacques Lafitte established maritime insurer <italic>Paris</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Assurance</italic> with <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>P\u00e9rier</italic>, and other BDF regents in 1816. The same group founded Parisian savings bank <italic>Caisse d\u2019\u00c9pargne</italic> soon after. \nThe French Ministry, seeking loans to fund reparations and liberation efforts, favored <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Hope</italic>, who subcontracted to <italic>Laffitte</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, and other French bankers in 1817. In 1818, <italic>Baring</italic> secured the largest share of a 21-million-<italic>franc</italic> bond issue, with a consortium of <italic>Laffitte</italic>, <italic>L</italic><italic>essert</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris receiving 3.1 million <italic>francs</italic>. Advocating for competitive bidding, <italic>P\u00e9rier</italic>\u2019s group of 32 bankers bid unsuccessfully on this loan but obtained a smaller 14.5-million-<italic>franc</italic> loan.\nAnd as interest rates fell, France\u2019s post-Napoleonic Bourbon regime chose <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, and <italic>Laffitte</italic> to convert her debt in 1824. As Bourbons regained control of Spain that year, Rothschild contemplated a loan with <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Reid Irving</italic>, but declined to lend to without guarantees. While France would not provide the assurances because of Spain\u2019s refusal to repay bonds or reimburse France for invasion expenses. And Britain suspected that Spain\u2019s Ferdinand VII would use the funds to reclaim his former South American colonies, which had been fighting for independence since 1808.\nWhile one of the British-branch Swiss Huguenot James Cazenove\u2019s sons worked at <italic>Lloyd</italic> from 1819, several others married into the Knapp banking family and created what became <italic>Cazenove</italic> broker in 1823. Buoyed by significant work from <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Cazenove</italic> became one of the largest firms on the stock exchange. After former<italic> Hottinguer</italic> partner Rougemont kinterlinked with a Thellusson in 1818, <italic>Hottinguer</italic> branched to Havre by 1824 to import British cotton, led by Bourlet, whose son apprenticed with Quaker <italic>Benson</italic>. And a year later, the daughter of a Thellusson and a British Vice Admiral married a Baring. By 1835, a granddaughter of <italic>Thellusson </italic>cousin <italic>Robarts</italic>\u2019 William Curtis married a Quaker Bevan.\nSince marrying Habsburg Court Banker Barbe Nettine\u2019s daughter, French Court banker Jean-Joseph Laborde was guillotined during the Reign of Terror. Before the Revolution, their two daughters married dukes. While their son Fran\u00e7ois was and elected deputy to the Estates General and banked at <italic>Boyd Ker</italic>, he died without issue in 1802. Another son, Alexandre, married Empress Josephine\u2019s lady-in-waiting and held various posts, including prefect and Councilor of State.  He received a barony in 1810 and became Deputy after the fall of Napoleon.\nAfter Alexandre Laborde\u2019s daughter married Genevan banker <italic>Lombard</italic>\u2019s cousin Edouard Odier in 1820, their Cazenove cousin kinterlinked with a Mallet in 1823. By 1830, Edouard\u2019s cousin Charles Odier joined his cousins at <italic>Lombard. Lombar</italic><italic>d</italic>\u2019s former partner Henri Hentsch banked in Paris where he helped found <italic>Paris</italic><italic> Assurance </italic>in 1816 and <italic>Caisse d\u2019\u00c9pargne </italic>in 1818. While two Mallet siblings married into the industrial Oberkampf family, their widowed father married fellow the widowed Madeleine LaTour, a sister-in-law of BDF Regent Guillaume Mallet and Genevan banker Bontemps.\nWith her first husband, Lyon banker \u00c9tienne Lessert, LaTour was the mother of Huguenot public official Gabriel Lessert, who married Fran\u00e7ois Laborde\u2019s daughter in 1824. Along with banking at <italic>Lessert</italic>, Gabriel\u2019s brother Benjamin founded a beet sugar refinery in 1801 and became Regent of BDF in 1802. He was elected to the <italic>Protestant Consistoire</italic> in 1808 and received a barony in 1812. With fellow BDF regents, Lessert co-founded <italic>Paris</italic><italic> Assurance</italic> and <italic>Caisse d\u2019\u00c9pargne</italic>. Another brother, who served as Regent of BDF from 1821 to 1848, married his daughter to Hottinguer\u2019s son in 1832. While their brother-in-law headed Lausanne<italic> </italic>bank <italic>Lessert Will</italic>, a cousin wed an in-law of the Huguenot banker Say family. Receiving the Lesserts\u2019 sugar assets after the Continental Blockade, the family established <italic>Say</italic> refinery by 1832.\n<italic>Mirabaud</italic> connected BDF to Italy. Originally of Gard in the south of France, Mirabaud joined Geneva\u2019s bourgeoisie in 1743. By 1814, Jacques Mirabaud established <italic>Mirabaud</italic> in Milan. He negotiated loans for the King of Sardinia in 1821 and the Duchess of Parma in 1823 and 1827, settling the \u2018Mont Napol\u00e9on\u2019 debt that split Italy at the Congress of Vienna. Following the death of Antoine P\u00e9rier in 1821, his brother Casimir became Head of <italic>P\u00e9rier</italic>, Regent of BDF, and President of <italic>Anzin</italic>, when the latter company suffered with low coal supplies following the loss of Belgian territories. Still, the family held BDF regencies until 1868. But Huguenots dominated BDF and industry, with the Huguenot Mallet and Vernes families being Regents of BDF for generations along with Catholic Seilli\u00e8re and Jewish <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris. \nAlthough the Jewish share of the population barely changed (0.16% to 0.24% between 1808 and 1886), French Jews shifted to urban areas since 1789, including Paris, where Cerf Berr\u2019s brother-in-law Rabbi David Sinzheim co-founded the <italic>Jewish</italic> <italic>Consistory of Paris</italic>. Several families led the way.\nDescended from Lion Halphen Goudchaux\u2019s brother and wealthy Kohanim in Metz, Gar\u00e7on Silny married Isaac Orchel\u2019s daughter in 1788 and founded <italic>Silny</italic> in Nancy to trade and bank. By 1793, Gar\u00e7on\u2019s brother Jacob married Hayem Worms\u2019 daughter. Gar\u00e7on\u2019s son Isaac joined <italic>Silny</italic>. While an 1808 decree restricted Jewish settlement in Saverne, Isaac married Marie Cerf, daughter of Saverne merchant, in 1812 and received an exemption. He lived, banked, and engaged in the consistory in Strasbourg, before joining his brother Michel. \nHaving trained with his uncle Jacob, a BDF correspondent in Metz, Michel formed <italic>Silny</italic> Paris in 1827 and became a lay President of the <italic>Consistory </italic>in 1829. Opposing socialism and the <italic>Revolution of 1830</italic>, he helped publish the liberal newspaper, <italic>National</italic>, and banked the Republicans. After being wounded during the uprising, Silny became mayor of a Paris district, but declined a higher post, opting to serve as a paymaster. By 1837, his niece, Isaac\u2019s daughter, married a descendant of Olry Worms, who joined the bank. While Silny and Eichthal focused on banking, the majority of descendants of the Jewish pioneering clan of France continued to peddle in cities like Metz and Nancy. \nStill, a few broke new grounds. Silny\u2019s cousin Isaie Orchel became a lawyer at the Metz bar in 1832 and later an advocate general at the Riom court of appeal.  Others, like Hayem Worms\u2019 cousin twice removed, Olry Dupont (unrelated to the Catholic DuPonts), and Salomon Halphen worked in jewelry. Malka Cahen\u2014a descendant of Elias Gomperz, Glikl and Joseph Goldschmidt, Lion Halphen Goudchaux, and Aisik Orchel, and a sister-in-law of Chief Rabbi of Metz Joseph Guggenheim\u2019s son\u2014married Salomon Halphen\u2014a descendant of Glikl and Joseph Goldschmidt and Elias Gomperz. \nBorn in Metz, Salomon moved to Paris by 1787, and in 1802, transitioned from haberdashery to being a jeweler. He ranked among the top taxed Jewish taxpayers in Paris by 1811. After he was elected to the <italic>Consistory of Paris</italic> in 1818, he started <italic>Halphen</italic> jewelers with his sons in the 1820s, several of whom married Frankfurt Oppenheims. One of these sons later succeeded Salomon at the <italic>Consistory</italic> and became a BDF Regent. \nSince starting as a merchant in Lorraine and selling supplies to the German army during the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War</italic>, Hayem Worms discounted food in a famine of 1770 and wed his son to Lion Goudachaux\u2019s great-granddaughter. In 1787, Hayem secured letters of protection. Settling and marrying in Paris in 1790, he operated a hosiery business and became deputy mayor in 1799. Hayem\u2019s daughter Rose married Jacob Silny in 1793, whose brother Gar\u00e7on wed Isaac Orchel\u2019s daughter in 1788. \nBy 1812, Gar\u00e7on\u2019s son married Katz-cousin Marie Cerf, whose cousin Esther Cerf Aron of Phalsbourg married Abraham Lazard\u2019s son Elie in 1820. While Esther\u2019s sister married David Weil, the second generation of Lazard, Weils, and Silny reinforced bonds. Likewise, Aron of Phalsbourg\u2019s third great-grandson served as Chief Rabbi of Strasbourg, his brother Alexandre worked in the dry goods trade and, by 1824, married a Katz descendant whose father served as Chief Rabbi of Karlsruhe and whose grandfather was Chief Rabbi of Metz until his death in 1785.\nAnd a descendant of Olry Worms, Hayem Worms, wed his daughter to a descendant of Glikl\u2019s Levy-Wimpfen husband, and his son, Olry, contracted his children to bankers: Baden Court Jew\u2019s son Max Haber, a daughter of the master of the post in Strasbourg Ratisbonne\u2014a Kaulla relative and a descendant of Cerf Berr, <italic>Boas</italic>, and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister\u2014and later succeeded him, and Sephardi Abraham Rodrigues of Bordeaux by 1826 (whose extended cousin married a Pereire two years earlier.) Abraham\u2019s cousin, Hippolyte Gradis Rodrigues, a son and grandson of Bordeaux stockbrokers, became a stockbroker at <italic>Paris </italic><italic>Stock Exchange</italic> and was already a Catholic when he married in a church ceremony in 1836.\nSince Cerf Berr\u2019s apprentice and Goudchaux cousin Lion Fould and his brother kinterlinked with descendants of Katz-Oppenheim and Levy-Wimpfen, and formed <italic>Fould</italic>, with Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s brother as a cashier. After<italic> Fould</italic> failed in the <italic>Panic of 1810</italic>, Lion Fould\u2019s daughter married the eldest son of Cologne banker Salomon Oppenheim by 1813 and founded Paris bank <italic>Fould Oppenheim</italic>. As Oppenheim\u2019s daughter wed Cerf Berr\u2019s Ratisbonne stepson in 1820, her sister married a banker Hertz after Lion\u2019s son Achille Brillin Fould married Henriette Hertz Goldschmidt. By the time Haber gained a hereditary nobility in 1829, Achille Fould hired Moses Mendelssohn\u2019s daughter as a governess for his daughter.\nSince 1780, the Schnappers of Frankfurt were the Imperial Court Jews of Austrian Count Metternich. While his father had married a Speyer before his birth, Wolf Schnapper married his cousin Gans, related to the Goldschmidts and conducted transactions on behalf of the Grand Duke Georg of Sachse-Aleiningen. While Wolf\u2019s son had married a nephew-in-law of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s daughter, he died by 1746. In 1770, Wolf\u2019s daughter Gutele married Mayer Rothschild. After raising five sons and five daughters into adulthood, she stayed in her ancestral home in Frankfurt\u2019s ghetto. Likewise, Gutele\u2019s cousin married Frankfurt banker Benedict May in 1768, who daughter married Joseph Reinach of Mainz in 1804 while the city was under French control. \nAlthough Mayer Rothschild established a strict rule that excluded women from <italic>Rothschild</italic> and limited individual actions and partnerships, wives, including in London and Vienna, were involved in the business behind the scenes. Likewise, cousins and in-laws continued to drove scale. After Mayer died in 1812, his sons branched to Berlin, Vienna, Paris, and Naples after 1815. \nPooling capital and syndicating national loans, Rothschild joined <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Reid Irving</italic>, <italic>Rougemont</italic>, <italic>Cazenove</italic>, along with the Jewish cousins <italic>Cohen-Barent</italic>, <italic>Mocatta</italic>, <italic>Montefiore</italic>, and <italic>Schnapper</italic> for Russian loans in 1820 and 1822. In 1820, <italic>Reid Irving</italic>\u2019s John Reid joined BOE as a director, which he remained on for decades. <italic>Rothchild</italic> London was the only non-Protestant Regent of BOE before WWI, Britain emancipated Catholics from 1820, allowing participation in public office. But like Jews, participation remained limited for decades, with no Catholic PM for two centuries.\nIn Vienna, continuing antisemitism required Solomon Rothschild to seek Metternich\u2019s permission for his cousin Anton Schnapper to move to Vienna and marry Maria Wertheim\u2014the daughter of Rothschild\u2019s clerk Leo Wertheim, a Katz-cousin descendant of Samson Wertheim\u2014by 1823. After Anton\u2019s brother wed Maria\u2019s second cousin in 1829, <italic>Rothschild</italic> applied for renewal of \u2018toleration\u2019 for another Frankfurt-born cousin and employee, Moritz Goldschmidt. Only between 1862 and 1865 did the Emperor ennobled the aforementioned Goldschmidt, Wertheim, and Schnapper.\nAnd, as Russia, Britain, Prussia, and Austria formed the <italic>Holy Alliance </italic>for a more \u2018Christian\u2019 approach to uprisings, the Alliance mandated Austria quash revolts across southern Italy in 1822 to maintain to prevent contagion. Austria commissioned <italic>Rothschild</italic> Naples to fund the invasion and occupation and then ennobled the family. To pressure Vienna into ending its occupation of Naples in 1823, the British government raised concerns about outstanding loans granted to Austria during the early stages of the war against France. Metternich requested Solomon Rothschild to seek assistance from his naturalized British citizen brother, Nathan, in influencing the British Ministry on Austria\u2019s behalf. Prior to approaching the Ministry, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London enlisted the support of <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Reid Irving</italic>. Together, these bankers convinced the London cabinet to reduce its claims in exchange for a cash payment. \nFrench bankers also reestablished Spanish credit. Possibly descended from ennobled Sephardi converts related to Spanish colonial governors, Alexandre Aguado supported Napoleon first as a soldier and then then an aide-de-camp. Exiled with Napoleon\u2019s downfall, Aguado became a French citizen. Parlaying his family connections in Havana and Mexico, Aguado became the financial agent of Spain\u2019s Ferdinand VII, floating loans in the late 1820s as one of France\u2019s wealthiest men.\nSerfdom continued east of Prussia. But industrialization spread in the west as Napoleon\u2019s <italic>Code</italic> continued. But as the <italic>Code</italic> shattered estates, fragmented land hindered mining in Spain, Italy, and German countries until soil nationalization in the 1860s. Retaining private soil, British banks and insurers funded estates to export coal. From the 1820s, bankers financed coal roads in French Alsace, Dutch Belgium, and Prussian Ruhr.\nNapoleon\u2019s conquest of the Netherlands and the western Germany propagated the liberating ideals of the French Revolution reforming the hereditary bondage and primogeniture of the manorial system with the <italic>French Code of 1807</italic>. Out of the ashes of Napoleon\u2019s Empire, emerged the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, a larger Prussia within the German Confederation, and the Kingdom of France. In the decades of peace following the Napoleonic Wars, governments restructured their credit and social systems between common law and the <italic>French Code </italic>as they deflated their enormous fiscal obligations and industrialized. \nUnder French control, Holland and Belgium adopted the <italic>Code</italic> and, after liberation, merged into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. While the <italic>Code</italic> abolished the Dutch bankruptcy process, it filled a void in the Southern Netherlands. So, as Northerner Dutch fought to return to traditional law, the Southern Belgians refused to adopt it. By then AWB deposits were at a nadir and the impoverished State liquidated it and founded <italic>Nederlandsche Bank</italic> with a paper money monopoly, but only issuing to Amsterdam. \nThe government subsequently chartered French-style companies to develop industry. Aside from insurance companies, the primary enterprises were <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic><italic> </italic>from 1824, which replaced VOC with to rebuild the Dutch East Indies trading company monopoly, in the north and, in the south, the Dutch king chartered <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic><italic> de </italic><italic>Belgique</italic> (\u201cSG <italic>Belge</italic>\u201d) to monetize royal estates and develop finance Belgian industry for export\u2014and English-style savings banks that invested in government debt.\nAlong with the government monopolies, Anglo-Dutch Christians led the Netherlands. By 1813, <italic>Baring</italic> took over <italic>Hope </italic>in Amsterdam, which was led by Huguenot Labouchere and with <italic>Borski </italic>as her sole broker. The connections ran deeply as Willem II Borski trained at <italic>Baring</italic> London. But they soon faced competition. \nWhile the Bischoffsheims had ties to rabbinical families of Bischofsheim and Mainz with Bamberg, Berr, Sichel, and Orchel extended cousins, the Cassels may have descended from a Goldschmidt Chief Rabbi of Kassel. Born outside of Strasbourg, Raphael Bischoffsheim moved to Mainz to rise from a small merchant to purveyor of the Elector of Mainz during the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>. After Bischoffsheim served as a representative at Napoleon\u2019s Grand Sanhedrin and died wealthy in 1814, his widow, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cassel, raised their children. Their son Raphel joined family friend<italic> </italic><italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, another son, Louis started a bank in Amsterdam, and their daughters married Mainz banker August Bamberger in 1821 and Joseph Belmont in 1824, after his Carlebach wife died.\nBack in 1797, Samson Wertheim\u2019s descendant Jakob Kann founded a bills and commissions business in Frankfurt and Hayum Goldschmidt, who descended from Joseph Goldschmidt\u2019s uncle, married Gelchen Gans, a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, and started a currency trading business. By 1817, Goldschmidt\u2019s son Benedict became a procurator in his firm. Following his marriage to Kann\u2019s daughter in 1820, Benedict founded his own currency trading bank in Frankfurt, <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>. After Kann\u2019s son Philipp became Benedict\u2019s proxy in 1824, another of Kann\u2019s sons married Benedict\u2019s sister in 1829. Benedict\u2019s other siblings married Amsterdam banker Louis Bischoffsheim in 1821 and Henriette Schnapper in 1825. Likewise, Kann\u2019s other children soon married Vienna banker Bernhard Wertheim, Hanover banker Adolf Behrens, Amsterdam banker Salomon Sichel, and Rebecca Kaulla of Stuttgart.\nAlso a delegate to the Assembly of Jewish Notables in 1806 and member of the Grand Sanhedrin in 1807, Meyerbeer Manheimer was a son of Samuel Manheimer\u2014the richest Jew of Uffholtz and a descendant of the former Zinswiller forge lessee Jacob Reichshoffer\u2014helped implement the 1808 civil decrees, joined the Israelite Consistory of the Haut-Rhin. \nAfter Meyerbaer\u2019s brother Mo\u00efse married Guiguitte\u2014a granddaughter of Isaac Aron of Phalsbourg, great granddaughter of Lion Halphen Goudchaux, and third great niece of Isaac Orchel\u2014in 1810, Meyerbaer\u2019s niece wed Guiguitte\u2019s brother in 1822. While Mo\u00efse was a merchant in Alsace before moving to Paris, Meyerbeer settled in Colmar, founded a bank in 1832, that became the most prosperous in the city and one of the most significant in eastern France.\nIn the 1830s, Prussia and other German lands had a financial sector that was less developed than most of Europe and America. There were a few exchanges focused on government securities and no corporate banks. In the 1830s, Bavaria and Saxony started early note-issuing bank monopolies using private capital but controlled by the states. Private bankers, mainly acting as commission merchants and money changers, were numerous, numbering 1,131 firms in Frankfurt by the 1850s. Among the few investment banks were <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> in Berlin, and <italic>Oppenheim</italic> in Cologne. \nSince Catholic Cologne expelled Jews and Protestants by the 17th century, the Rhine\u2019s economic activity shifted to nearby towns, like Bonn, Frankfurt, and Wuppertal. After gaining control of the Rhineland in 1815, Prussia retained her commercial code, while the <italic>French Code</italic> governed the Rhineland. While the Catholic stronghold of Cologne allowed Jews to enter for the first time in centuries in the late 1780s, Protestant Prussia supported the minority Protestants. Although the <italic>Code</italic> decreased plantations in the Rhineland, Prussia\u2019s King issued moratoria to Junkers during the war, banks normally foreclosed on defaulting estates to maintain price stability. However, the process was faster in annexed Polish territory, where Prussia subdued the nobility.\nSince not even the archbishops of Cologne could permit residency for his Court Jews since the 15th century, the Elector of Cologne granted protection to his Jews in Bonn. Possibly a descendant of King Daivd, Samuel Cah\u00e9n of Deutz moved to Bonn around 1700, his son married the daughter of Rabbi Mehler, a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe\u2019s brother, and joined his father in Bonn. Another son, Lambert, became a Protected Jew in 1729 and married a Geldern, a descendant of Glikl Goldschmidt and relative to the Parnas of Geldern. \nOf unknown connection to the Cah\u00e9n, Hirsch Cahn of Bonn wed Beyle Speyer. Their son, Jonas, was a merchant from 1748 and opened <italic>Cahn</italic> bank in 1770. Since Salomon Oppenheim, a Katz-cousin and extended cousin of Samuel Oppenheim, left Frankfurt for Bonn in the first half of the 18th century to trade textiles. While his brother married a Cah\u00e9n, Salomon\u2019s daughter married a Goldschmidt of Frankfurt and son married a Seligmann and continued in commerce.\nAmidst the <italic>French Revolution</italic>, as wealthy Germans sought to protect their assets in Amsterdam and beyond, private banks distinct from trade arose. Since  Salomon Oppenheim established <italic>Oppenheim</italic> in Bonn by 1789, he soon became one of the first Jews to move to Cologne. His brother remained a merchant in Bonn and married Hanna, a Katz descendant daughter of the Chief Rabbi of Bonn in 1798. \nAlso remaining in Bonn, Jonas Speyer Cahn opened <italic>Cahn</italic> bank in 1770, his nephew married Gutle Schnapper Rothschild\u2019s sister in 1798 and daughter wed Moises Cassel Zeligman\u2014a descendant of the Goldschmidt related Court Jews of Kassel and an in-law of the Parnas of Geldern, relatives of the Orchel and Liebman families\u2014by 1800. By 1807, Jonas\u2019 son Heinrich married Hanna\u2019s sister, becoming Salomon Oppenheim\u2019s brother-in-law. By 1815, Heinrich and Moises inherited <italic>Cahn</italic>. Along with trading Prussian real estate, they worked with <italic>Fould Oppenheim</italic> and Zeligman\u2019s relatives Cologne banker Baruch Cassel and army contractor Samuel Zeligman in the 1820s.\nAnd, since starting as a spice merchant in Bonn and marrying the daughter of the Chief Rabbi of D\u00fcsseldorf, Mayer Geldern Cah\u00e9n transitioned into banking. Their son Lambert was very close to Heinrich Cahn. He married an in-law of Johann Eskeles\u2014a Katz descendant and first cousin thrice removed of the co-founder of <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic>, with whom he founded a soap factory and engaged in other trades. While one of Mayer\u2019s sons became a merchant in Antwerp and married a Frankfurt descendant of Joseph Goldschmidt in 1824, another son, Joseph, moved to Antwerp and became a broker for <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic>, soon marrying Raphael Bischoffsheim\u2019s daughter.\nParticularly after the <italic>Panic of 1826</italic> brought down the Christian <italic>Benecke</italic> of Berlin, Christian tradesmen transitioned into banking. In 1761, Protestant Johann Herstatt took over his father\u2019s silk factory and transitioned to banking in 1782, soon supporting industrial ventures like Alfred Krupp\u2019s steel empire. After Johann\u2019s death in 1809, his son Friedrich took control, and the bank grew further. By 1830, Friedrich\u2019s son married a daughter of Johann Styn. \nStyn, also a Protestant, had founded <italic>Styn</italic> trading firm in Cologne in 1790. After he died in 1820, his widow took control of the firm. Within a year, their daughter married Carl Schnitzler, whose father and their fathers before them had been merchants and mayors of Gr\u00e4frath, Bergisches Land. Alongside his mother-in-law and her sons, Schnitzler became a<italic> </italic><italic>Styn</italic> partner and senior partner from 1825, when he transformed the trading firm into a bank and became <italic>Royal Commercial Councilor</italic>.\nThe son of a Catholic Cologne banker, Johann Schaaffhausen founded <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic> around 1790 with his Protestant son-in-law Wilhelm Deichmann. From 1807, he focused on real estate, acquiring 46 estates in 1818, before shifting from trade to banking and providing industrial loans to textiles, leather, and heavy industry. He held public offices, including councilor and president of the commercial court, until his death in Cologne in 1824, when his son-in-law Deichmann continued the business. \nDeichmann\u2019s cousin-in-law wed a Fremery, whose sister married David Hansemann. A son of a Protestant minister in Hamburg, Hansemann became wealthy in the linen trade and founded <italic>Aachen Fire Insurance Co</italic> in 1825. The son of another a Protestant pastor of J\u00fcchen and Baerl, Johann Kamp became a partner in his father-in-law\u2019s bank <italic>Brink </italic>in 1808. He co-founded <italic>Mechanical Workshop Harkort </italic>in Wetter, <italic>Rhenish</italic><italic> </italic><italic>West Indi</italic><italic>es</italic><italic> Co</italic> (1821), <italic>Patriotic Fire Insurance Co </italic>(1822), and <italic>German-American Mining Association</italic> (1824). Kamp served as President of the Elberfeld-Barmen Chamber of Commerce from 1831. \nThe Protestant Berenberg family fled Antwerp for Cologne around 1515. Later in the century, Hans Berenberg and his brother married Schnelling sisters\u2014tied to trading in Spain, Italy, and Hamburg\u2014and settled in the Hanseatic Free City of Hamburg, where they traded goods including cochineal, cloth, madder, indigo, cotton, ginger, and spices with Sanl\u00facar, Venice, Stade, Amsterdam, and Marseille. In 1616, Paul participated in <italic>Danish East Indi</italic><italic>es</italic><italic> Co</italic>. Shortly after, they became among the first account holders at <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of </italic><italic>Hamburg</italic>. \nThey later founded a bank, which, after the family kinterlinked with the Gosslers, became <italic>Berenberg</italic> <italic>Gossler</italic> in 1791. After the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, they kinterlinked with fellow Hanseatic Protestants, including Hamburg merchant bankers <italic>Amsinck</italic><italic> </italic>and a granddaughter of Conrad Donner was born in Altona to a Director of the Danish <italic>Specie Bank</italic>, which issued notes until 1813. Donner had joined <italic>Danish East Indi</italic><italic>es</italic><italic> Co</italic> in 1798 and founded <italic>Donner</italic> in Altona to trade overseas goods, conducted banking for French \u00e9migr\u00e9s.\nThey also engaged in North American trade and finance. In the 1820s, Johann Gossler was sent to America to maintain existing business relationships and establish new contacts. In 1829 he traveled to Boston and married a granddaughter of a former President of <italic>Massachusetts Bank</italic> and cousin of the Higginson and Thayer families. While he founded <italic>Gossler Knorre</italic> in Boston with another emigrant, his brothers ran <italic>Berenberg</italic> <italic>Gossler</italic>. \nMeanwhile, as the United Kingdom of the Netherlands debated <italic>Code</italic> revision, it institutionalized the moratoria process and limited its impact for secured creditors after the <italic>Panic of 1825</italic>. Despite spiking in 1827, Dutch bankruptcies remained low as the <italic>Nederlandsche Bank</italic> and Prussian-style land banks added credit. Moreover, the north experienced a boom in credit-producing insurance<italic> </italic>companies, that the government limited after 1828. \nNearby, Louis Boigues, the son of a Paris iron trader, introduced coke-based iron production in France. After he lent to <italic>Foulques</italic> in Pont-Saint-Ours in 1826, his sister married the nephew and adopted son of BDF Regent Francois Jaubert. While Boigues initiated <italic>Saint-\u00c9tienne-Andr\u00e9zieux</italic> RR, <italic>Foulques</italic> went bankrupt by 1830 as Belgian credit fell and the Dutch King directed SG <italic>Belge</italic> to discount CP for select collieries. \nAs failures spread, so did ruinous competition, leading <italic>Baccarat</italic> to start a crystal cartel in 1830. As <italic>Chagot</italic> resumed <italic>Creusot</italic>\u2019s crystal factory, <italic>Baccarat</italic>\u2019s cartel refused entry. While the cartel offered to pay to give up making crystal, <italic>Chagot</italic> refused. So, the cartel bought a factory. Before Dieuze notary Antoine Schneider died in 1828, his sons joined the <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic> bank. By 1830, Eug\u00e8ne Schneider managed the Bazeilles forges for <italic>Neuflize</italic> as his brother Adolphe married Boigues\u2019 stepdaughter. \nBy 1831, the Dutch Kingdom legislated to replace the <italic>Code</italic>. With the dearth of credit and promise of unwanted legal change, savings banks suspended as the French <italic>Revolution</italic> destabilized government debt. Within months Belgium seceded. As Johnathan Bischoffsheim moved to Brussels, he married the sister of Frankfurt banker <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>\u2019s Benedict Gans Goldschmidt, and together with his Louis in Amsterdam and their brothers-in-law, started <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> in 1832. \nAfter retaining his services as a merchant-trader in Amsterdam, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris appointed cousin Lazare Schnapper Richtenberger in Brussels by 1832 as the first fully fledged agent. While SG <italic>Belge</italic> continued, Belgium\u2019s new government chose <italic>Bank of Belgium</italic><italic> </italic>as her agent in 1835 which invested in coal mining and ironworks to supply the construction of the state railway network. Funded by<italic> Rothschild</italic> Paris and <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Belgium</italic>\u2019s treasurer was Adolphe Oppenheim. Born in Frankfurt like <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne\u2019s founder and an extended cousin of the Cologne founder and of Samuel Oppenheim through the paternal line, Adolphe\u2019s brother Joseph founded <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels.\n<italic>Rothschild</italic> also utilized agents, correspondents, and satellite banks. Since Nathan Rothschild sister\u2019s wed Speyer cousin Bernhard Sichel in 1802, <italic>Sichel</italic> represented the family in Amsterdam, while Cohen-Barent in-law <italic>Ezechiels</italic> was <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Rotterdam correspondent. And as Cohen-Barent Ezechiels kinterlinked with Goldsmid cousin and Amsterdam banker Simon Daniels, the latter\u2019s brother wed <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne in-law <italic>Cahn</italic>\u2019s Heinrich Cahn\u2019s daughter in 1835. \nLikewise, the Kann family\u2014descended from Frankfurt bankers and descended from Oppenheim, Wertheim, and Boas\u2014of the Hague formed <italic>Lissa Kann</italic><italic> </italic>in 1805 shortly after the Lissa kinterlinked with a first cousin twice removed of Lobl Duschenes, Primator of Prague Jews<italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>While <italic>Lissa Kann </italic>did not kinterlink with <italic>Ezechiels</italic>, a Kann heiress married Salomon Rothschild Sichel in 1833.\nSince Amsterdam\u2019s Dani\u00ebl Boissevain formed shipping and trade company <italic>Boissevain </italic>in 1795, he kinterlinked with the Mennonite Clercq family that helped form and lead <italic>Nederlandsche Bank</italic> and <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic> from decades. After Boissevain\u2019s son kinterlinked with <italic>Stiglitz</italic>\u2019s London agent by marrying Caroline Mollet in 1833, his Clercq grandson later married Caroline\u2019s niece and directed <italic>Netherlands Trading Society</italic>. <italic>Boissevain</italic> collaborated with converted Sephardi<italic> Teixeira</italic>, <italic>Speyer</italic>\u2019s Amsterdam agent. In 1838, Teixeira\u2019s in-law Elisabeth Mendes married Josef Cah\u00e9n, a brother of <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic>\u2019s in-law Antwerp banker Joseph Cah\u00e9n, who opened <italic>Cah\u00e9n</italic> Amsterdam. \nAfter a Dutch <italic>Borski</italic> heir married a Boode\u2014kinterlinking with <italic>Hope</italic>\u2019s Pierre Labouchere, <italic>Bethmann</italic>, and <italic>Metzler</italic> of Frankfurt\u2014in 1820, one of Hamburg-born <italic>Hope</italic> partner Hieronimus Sillem\u2019s daughters married a Swiss Cazanove-cousin Odier in 1823, her sister married a <italic>Borski</italic> heir. Likewise, Borski and Labouchere kinterlinked with <italic>Insinger</italic> heirs. While <italic>Hope</italic>\u2019s partner <italic>Baring</italic> kinterlinked with a former <italic>Cornish Mining Bank</italic> partner connected to <italic>Glyn</italic> and <italic>Lubbock</italic>,  Labouchere\u2019s nephew married a Mallet by 1839.\nOver time, Johanna reduced her involvement, and in 1832, Willem II took over the day-to-day operations. After supporting <italic>Netherlands Trading Society </italic>with favorable terms in 1840, she died in 1846, when Willem increasingly invested in American railroads, to the detriment of the firm.\nSimultaneously, the emancipation of Belgium in 1830 offered the Rhineland an opportunity to connect to the North Sea and bypass the Dutch monopoly on the Rhine River transport. In 1834, Ludolf Camphausen, who married a sister-in-law of Johann Styn\u2019s second cousin once removed, and <italic>Hansemann</italic> founded rival companies to build the Rhineland-Belgium line. \nBy 1837, <italic>Camphausen</italic> and <italic>Hansemann</italic> fused their Prussian railroad ventures into<italic> Rhineland</italic> RR with financing from<italic> </italic><italic>Styn</italic>, <italic>Herstatt</italic>, <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>,<italic> Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne, <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris. Likewise, as Prussia barred foreign insurers in 1837, <italic>Aachen Fire Insurance </italic>bought French policies, leading <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne, <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, <italic>Styn</italic>, and <italic>Herstatt</italic> to found <italic>Cologne Fire Insurance Co </italic>(\u201c<italic>Colonia</italic>\u201d), with Johann Kamp as the first Director.\nWithout coal, French wood and British imports inflated. As BDF guarded gold after the <italic>Panic of 1825</italic>, she squeezed industry and fueled France\u2019s<italic> Revolution of 1830</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Panic of 1830</italic>. Earlier, withering without munitions in France, <italic>Creusot</italic>\u2019s creditor, <italic>Chagot</italic>, took her over in 1813, and sublet her to British <italic>Manby</italic> in 1826. With the bankruptcy of British <italic>Manby </italic>in 1832, Aguado and Fould acquired <italic>Creusot</italic> from <italic>Chagot</italic>. As coal helped French iron prospecting boom from 1834, <italic>Seilli\u00e9re</italic> gained notoriety as a speculator. \nWhile <italic>Cahn</italic> of Bonn\u2019s Heinrich Cahn\u2019s daughter married Amsterdam banker Simon Daniels\u2014related to the Rothschild, Cohen-Barent, Ezechiel, and Goldsmid families\u2014in 1835, <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne\u2019s children married Haber, Rothschild Beyfus (who also wed with one another), Daniel Itzig-Jaffe\u2019s Dutch great-granddaughter, and Kaulla\u2019s Augsburg partner, and Kaulla kinterlinked with <italic>Heine</italic>. \nThe same year Louis Haber married a niece of Vienna banker Leo L\u00e4mel and Sophie Eichthal, L\u00e4mel\u2019s daughter married Leo Javal of Paris in 1830. After Sephardi Pereire brothers of Bordeaux\u2014cousins of Pereira, Rodrigues, and Brandon\u2014started a journal to advocating for development banks in 1825, they obtained a charter for France\u2019s first common carrier, <italic>Paris-Saint</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Germain</italic> RR, in 1835, which they built with funding from<italic> Rothschild </italic>Paris, <italic>Fould Oppenheim</italic>, <italic>Eichthal</italic>, and <italic>Heine</italic>. \nThe Heines also reinforced bonds between Hamburg, Prussia, and Russia with fellow converted Court Jews. Since Saint-Petersburg bank <italic>Stiglitz</italic> kinterlinked with the Heines of Hamburg at the turn of the century, <italic>Heine</italic>\u2019s Heckscher partner married a Stiglitz in 1832. And as a Heine married a Mendelssohn of Berlin in 1835, another Heine married a Heckscher by 1837. By then, the Lutheran <italic>Schepeler</italic> of Riga formed <italic>Schepeler</italic> New York by 1835, which soon became <italic>Stiglitz</italic>\u2019s New York agents.\nMeanwhile, unlike the Continent, Britain did not have Jewish railway barons. The key early figures\u2014<italic>Pease</italic>, <italic>Hudson</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2014were all Christian. Before 1830, British railways were short and linked to canals or docks. Around the <italic>Panic of 1825</italic>, Isaac Goldsmid served as director of <italic>London </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Birmingham</italic> and <italic>Grand Junction</italic>, of which Moses Montefiore was director, Edward Goldsmid audited <italic>London Northern</italic>, and Nathan Rothschild promoted <italic>Festiniog</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Portmadoc</italic> RR. Only <italic>Liverpool </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Manchester Railway</italic> was completed, with Colonel Aguilar as shareholder. Interest revived in the early 1830s and peaked around the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>. \nBy 1841, <italic>Goldsmid</italic> directed <italic>London</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Brighton</italic> and <italic>London</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Greenwich</italic>; John Ricardo directed <italic>London</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Croydon</italic>; Leo Schuster directed <italic>Manchester & Leeds</italic>, and Francis Henry Goldsmid served as Counsel of <italic>London</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Brighton</italic>. During the 1844\u201346 railway mania, Emanuel Lousada served on <italic>Exeter Great Western</italic>\u2019s committee, Montefiore chaired <italic>Swansea</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Loughor</italic> RR, Isaac Lyon Goldsmid with  Ricardo and David Salomons. From an Anglo-Dutch Sephardi family kinterlinked with Goldsmid cousin Keysers, as well as Christian bankers, Richardo was a half-Jew and associated with <italic>Westminster</italic> like  Salomons. \nWhile <italic>Rothschild</italic> London provided a loan to the Spanish Government for a monopoly of <italic>Almad\u00e9n</italic> mercury in 1835, Nathan Rothschild left brother-in-law Daniel Weisweiller as the family\u2019s Spanish agent. Along with French monopoly rights for Russia\u2019s <italic>Demidov</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> dominated European sales of mercury, essential for refining precious metals. Like <italic>Rothschild</italic>, Weisweiller employed local Christians, such as the Basque Estanislao Urquijo to negotiate silver contracts.\nThe French boom also stimulated Spain, which chartered <italic>Royal Asturian Mines</italic>. In Santander, <italic>Rothschild</italic> hired the Christian Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00e9n Vial Lopez-Doriga. While Jos\u00e9 had linked the Lopez-Doriga and Vial mercantile families with his wife\u2019s Aguirre clan, his death led his widow to marry Jos\u00e9 Botin, a surgeon of Cadiz. \nBy 1836, Aguado and Fould sold <italic>Creuset</italic>, to <italic>Schneider</italic>, funded by Boigues, <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic>, and <italic>Neuflize</italic>. The same year, <italic>Creusot</italic> hired the Catholic Charles Demachy, whose father was the Bourbon King\u2019s royal stockbroker in the 1820s.<italic> </italic>Acquiring Montcenis coal, <italic>Schneider</italic> sold the crystal factory to <italic>Baccaart</italic>, and agreed to not produce crystal for half a century. \nAfter Emile Fould became the first Jewish notary in Paris, followed by the sons of Salomon Halphen and Gar\u00e7on Silny, Fould\u2019s cousin married a Katz-cousin Heine in 1838, kinterlinking with Stiglitz and Mendelssohn. However, the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic> forced <italic>Stiglitz</italic> to liquidated <italic>Stiglitz</italic> Odessa and <italic>Mahs</italic> took the banking business. As <italic>Stiglitz</italic> and Mahs continued to dominate London flax, Ernest Mahs became a <italic>Stiglitz</italic> partner to trade with the Christian <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic><italic> </italic>of Hamburg. The following year, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> kinterlinked with <italic>Donner</italic> of Hamburg, and so grew closer to <italic>Berenberg</italic> <italic>Gossler</italic>.\nWhile Jacques Laffitte tried to organize a note-issuing Parisian bank in 1836, BDF objected that his notes competed with her own and prohibited them from being payable on demand. So, Laffitte formed the <italic>Caisse G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> to issue bearer time deposits, possibly following <italic>Bank of the United States </italic>(\u201cBUSP\u201d). Still, France had only 25 miles of railroads, while Britain had over 2,000. So, Jacques Laffitte\u2019s nephew, Charles Laffitte, partnered with Edward Blount, a British Catholic who promoted <italic>Provincial Bank of Ireland</italic> before becoming a French diplomat. Together, <italic>Blount Laffitte </italic>promoted French railroads. \nAs France debated central railroad planning, she granted a concession.<italic> </italic>By 1838, France amended the <italic>Code</italic> after decades of debate. The amendment increased bankruptcies by eliminating the previously allowed distinction between commercial bills of exchange subject to bankruptcy without moratoria and civil promissory notes permitted to make assignments for the benefits of creditors and granted judicial stays. So, banks soon replaced notaries. With the easy bankruptcy, the <italic>Code</italic> required public registration of securities and other transfers. \nAlthough special laws allowed BDF<italic> </italic>and<italic> Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic> to lend on collateral security, private collateral loan money markets could not develop in France. Without <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 involvement in coal roads, other investors such as <italic>Reid Irving</italic> in Belgium in 1838, <italic>Tastett</italic> in 1840, and <italic>Baring</italic> and Gladstone-affiliated <italic>Thomson Bonar</italic> in French syndicates in 1843 were neither sustained nor coordinated. As <italic>Rhineland</italic> RR suffered financial difficulties, Prussia rejected a petition for aid, forcing Belgian intervention via <italic>Rothschild</italic> to prevent liquidation. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1839</italic>, run started on <italic>Bank of Belgium</italic> and, when the run spread to <italic>Caisse Generale</italic>, BDF discounted the latter\u2019s paper. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> supported SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Bank of Belgium</italic> suspended convertibility and ceased discounting, sparking a depression in Belgium without government intervention. That year, the daughter of Adolphe Oppenheim<italic> </italic>of<italic> Bank of Belgium</italic> and <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels married Rothschild\u2019s cousin<italic> Reinach</italic>. \nAs Bischoffsheim cousin and Cologne Court Jew descendant, Germain Cassel, founded a Brussels bank in 1839 (and married a <italic>Stern</italic> of Frankfurt by 1842), The <italic>Rothschild</italic>-linked Sterns also branched to London, Paris, and Amsterdam. Louis Bischoffsheim<italic> </italic>branched <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> to London in 1840 and Paris in 1848, leading his in-law, Joseph Cah\u00e9n, to move his family bank to Paris and power his own career. Having starting funded <italic>Bavarian Mortgage & Exchange Bank</italic> with Hirsch, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, and Wertheim of Munich in 1835, <italic>Eichthal</italic> built and operated Augsburg\u2019s lighting gas factory from 1847.  \nSince <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 Belgian agent Lazare Schnapper Richtenberger settled in Brussels, his son-in-law Samuel Ca\u00efn \u201cLambert\u201d, born in Lyon to Alsatian merchants, branched to Antwerp by 1843. Upon Richtenberger\u2019s death in 1853, Lambert inherited the business and renamed her <italic>Lambert</italic>. \nJewish banking families abandoned religion for various reasons. After her sister married an Eichthal in 1842, Anna Rodrigues kinterlinking with Ernest Go\u00fcin, of a Christian Touraine banking family, in 1845. As an engineer, Go\u00fcin had worked on the <italic>Paris-Saint-Germain</italic> and <italic>Versailles </italic>railroads, and founded rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> in Clichy and Mulhouse with funding from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Pereire</italic>, and <italic>Eichthal </italic>in 1847.\nLike his sister, an <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne heir converted in 1839 to enter politics. As Achille Fould\u2019s cousin wed a Katz and Speyer cousin Palmyre Oulma in 1836, Eug\u00e8ne Schneider wed Neuflize\u2019s niece. When Alexandre Aguado died after visiting the Asturias coal mines that he had just acquired in 1842, Fould entered politics in the Hautes Pyrenees council-general, and soon became a deputy for Tarbes. \nAnd as New Orleans\u2019s economy recovered that year, their cousins-in-law, brothers Armand Heine and Michel Heine established a commission and banking business in New Orleans. A son of New Orleans banker Joachim Kohn, on the other hand, started a bank in Paris soon after. Amidst the Great Fire of Hamburg in 1842, Salomon Heine placed large amounts of cash into the market to prevent financial stagnation and offered it for discount against bills. He contributed even more to Hamburg\u2019s loan for reconstruction.\nAlso in 1842, Palmyre Oulma Fould\u2019s brother Emil married a Katz-Oppenheim, Wertheim, Speyer, Frankel, and Hannover\u2019s Lipman Cohen-Behrens descendant Simonette Wertheim, an in-law of Merton and Rothschild. The same year, Fould was among the first elected Jewish deputies, along with Cerf Berr\u2019s son and Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux. As Fould converted to Protestantism in 1846, his daughter with his Heine wife wed a French aristocrat, the first of many such mixed religion kinterlinks between Jewish bankers with Christian nobles. Over King Louis-Philippe\u2019s reign, Jews increasingly participated in national life, with Fould serving as Minister of Finance and State from 1849 over the following two decades.\nAfter reprimanding David Drach for converting in 1823, Olry Worms became President of the <italic>Consistory of Paris</italic> but resigned in 1843 after his granddaughter converted to Catholicism. (Along with her sisters, she married a French aristocrat.) Worms\u2019 successor was Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux, a lawyer who succeeded as deputy in 1842 in opposition to the monarchy after Jacques Laffitte retired. However, Cr\u00e9mieux resigned in 1845 after the secret conversions of his daughters. \nWhile Th\u00e9odore Ratisbonne, a descendant of Cerf Berr and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, converted to Catholicism in 1827, became a priest in 1830, and co-founded a congregation to convert Jews, his brother, Marie-Alphonse remained in banking until converting in 1842, when became a priest, and later joined Th\u00e9odore. Still, their Oppenheim Ratisbonne niece married a Worms heir in 1845. Since the son of Berlin\u2019s wealthiest Jew, Jacob Beer, married a Mendelssohn in 1818, the daughter of Beer\u2019s other son married Salomon Haber\u2019s son in 1842. Their nieces\u2014the daughters of the converted Max Haber and Hayem Worms\u2019 granddaughter\u2014subsequently married Christian aristocrats.\nSince Alex Mendelssohn married a Seligmann  and converted to Lutheranism and became head of <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, his cousin wed a Heine in 1835, and, in the late 1840s, his daughters married cousins Otto Oppenheim and Robert Oppenheim Warschauer, second great nephews of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe and heirs of K\u00f6nigsberg<italic> </italic>bank <italic>Oppenheim Warschauer</italic>. In 1849, Warschauer opened the Berlin branch <italic>Warschauer </italic>in 1849 with Eduard Synger, a descendant of Koppel Frankel and cousin of the Mendelssohns.\nIn 1852, Mendelssohn\u2019s daughter married a Horsfall, a Christian African palm oil trader of Yorkshire. Likewise, Mendelssohn\u2019s second cousin Adolph Hertz\u2014born in Hamburg to banker Jacob Hertz, a cousin-in-law of the Goldsmid, Rothschild, and Fould families, Fanny Bacher, a second great-granddaughter of Samuel Oppenheim and niece of Moses Mendelssohn through his wife, Frumet Guggenheim\u2014converted to Lutheranism in 1822. He acquired ships from 1837 and expanded trade to China, East India, Africa, and Arabia by 1844. His son Ferdinand traveled to Africa, Arabia, and East Indies from 1850 to 1854, while his son John established a Zanzibar factory in 1851.\nIn France, pamphleteers such as Alexandre Weill attacked reformed Judaism and capitalism of Rothschild and the <italic>Consistory </italic>by the early 1840s. Still, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and London refused to fund the <italic>French Ministry </italic>(\u201cMOF\u201d) public railroads until 1845. But religious and geographic alliances soon broke the deadlock. Connected to the Huguenot Thelusson and Mallet families since the 18th century, the Pictets kinterlinked with the Cazenoves in 1823, and, by 1841, Edouard Mallet Pictet joined his cousins at the Geneva bank <italic>Candolle Mallet</italic>. \nIn 1843, <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic> allied with <italic>Baring</italic> and fellow Catholic banker <italic>Durand</italic> to compete for P<italic>aris-Lille-Belgium </italic>RR concession. They faced opposition from <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 syndicate, supported by <italic>Mallet</italic> and <italic>Lefevre</italic>. After debates in the Chamber of Deputies in 1845, <italic>Rothschild</italic> successfully obtained the concession, leading to the founding of <italic>Nord</italic>. As BDF limited credit, however, famine spread.\nMoreover, British industrialization reverberated through the Rhineland. After Caspar Engels started a firm near Wuppertal producing lace and ribbon in 1747, his grandson Johann expanded production and diversified into mineral baths, steam brick factory, and potash. Following Johann\u2019s death, three of his sons continued the business while Friedrich left the company in 1837 to start a partnership in Manchester and, in 1840, Engelskirchen, near Cologne. The same year, his nephew married a Meinertzhagen cousin. \nWhile <italic>Schunk Souchay</italic> built a printworks near Manchester that year, a Schunk Souchay heiress and niece-in-law of a Benecke married Felix Mendelssohn. By 1841, Souchay\u2019s cousin married Carl Bunge. While his paternal grandmother was a Krupp, Carl\u2019s mother was a Boelling, connected to the Dutch Protestant Croon family of the Lower Rhineland, which was prominent in the cotton and grain trade.\nLikewise, Anglo-Hanseatic merchants traded cotton across the Baltic. Since <italic>Meinertzhagen</italic> of Bremen failed in 1826, Daniel Meinertzhagen moved to London and joined <italic>Huth</italic>. By then, Carey DeJersey,  of the failed Guernsey bank <italic>Bishop DeJersey</italic>, partnered with <italic>Frericks</italic> of Hamburg to form <italic>DeJersey</italic> in Manchester and export cotton twist to Russia. Around 1838,<italic> DeJersey</italic> hired Bremen-born Ludwig Knoop\u2014whose aunt had married a Meinertzhagen cousin-in-law\u2013in Manchester, and by 1840, represented the firm in Russia. After Britain lifted her ban on machinery exports in 1842, Knoop married the daughter of a Baltic-German merchant in Moscow and secured an exclusive agency with <italic>Platt</italic> for Russia.\nPossibly an in-law of Deichmann and Hansemann, yarn wholesaler Christian Fremery partnered with Gustav Gierlings Mevissen. The son of a Catholic landholder, Mevissen joined his family\u2019s business, including the production of flax for linen business of his father and the linen trade of his maternal grandfather Gierlings. Along with his cousin and brother-in-law Franz Gierlings Koenigs, Mevissen became impressed with British industrialization. \nIn 1841, he moved to Cologne, where he partnered with Fremery and became involved in reform politics. (Still, Junker conservatives led Prussia, which donated Silesian plantations to banks and raised tariffs from 1842.) Following a fire in Hamburg in 1842, <italic>Mevissen</italic> and <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne formed an independent reinsurance company to work with <italic>Colonia</italic>, which he invested in, but approval dragged on.\nAfter a dispute with Hansemann, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne and <italic>Styn</italic><italic> </italic>resigned, and, per <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne\u2019s request, Mevissen became President of <italic>Rhineland</italic> RR in 1844. He also restructured the financially troubled <italic>Rhineland </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> and explored founding joint-stock companies for coal mining in the Ruhr. Due to legal restrictions, he established the consortium including <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>for <italic>Cologne Mining Association</italic>. Likewise, authorities rejected his claims to extend the railway. Despite his efforts, Prussia continued to reject joint-stock banks, and Mevissen faced obstacles in establishing one in 1845.\nOn a smaller scale, <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne\u2019s brother-in-law <italic>Cahn</italic> developed Bonn. After Heinrich Cahn\u2019s daughter married a brother of Amsterdam bankers, Michael Behrend\u2014who descended from Behrend Lehmann and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother and was a Rothschild Sichel in-law\u2014in 1841, <italic>Cahn</italic> supported the financial stability and growth of <italic>Bonn Savings Bank</italic> from 1842. Between 1843 to 1845, <italic>Cahn</italic> managed property sales, including a house in Bonn, forest rights, life insurance policies, and a mill in Schweinheim. <italic>Cahn</italic> also acquired shares in <italic>Vereinigte Sellerbeck</italic> mining company and participated in infrastructure projects, serving as a director of <italic>Bonn-Cologne</italic> RR in 1846 and acquired vineyard through <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> of Amsterdam.\nWhen Prussia\u2019s <italic>Royal Bank</italic> halted operations to restructure into <italic>Prussian Bank</italic>, she squeezed <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>of Cologne and other Ruhr banks in the process. Easing tariffs amid failures, Prussia banned exports with inflation in 1846. In Hessen-Darmstadt, <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne-in-law <italic>Haber</italic> applied for a concession for <italic>Bank for Southern</italic> Germany in 1846, but authorities were uninterested. And again, Frankfurt rejected plans for a joint-stock bank. Hamburg, however, allowed <italic>Berenberg Gossler</italic> and <italic>Merck</italic>\u2014started by a relative of the patrician Hamburg pharmaceutical family\u2014to found <italic>Hamburg-American Shipping</italic>. \nEarlier, in the <italic>Panic of 1839</italic>, le <italic>Rothschild</italic> refused to aid BOE but <italic>Baring</italic> did. In 1840, BOE abolished her gold broker monopoly with <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic> to buy from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and soon others. Linking British protectionism to the colonial crises in America, merchant bankers Members of Parliament<italic> </italic>Brown, Shipley, Irving, and <italic>Smyth</italic> bankers, joined Chancellor of the Exchequer Baring against Grenfell and other protectionists in lowering tariffs for free trade of cotton and corn from America and Egypt by 1841. \nWith the creation of <italic>Bank of Ceylon </italic>in 1841, <italic>Rothschild</italic> invested in Ceylonese tea plantations. While a son of Nathan Rothschild\u2019s sister Jeanette and Benedict d\u2019Worms married Henriette, a daughter of a Katz-Samuel descendent and <italic>Cohen-Barent</italic>\u2019s daughter, their other two sons Gabriel and Moritz d\u2019Worms planted the tea initial cuttings from China on Rothschild\u2019s Ceylonese estate. Other relatives struggled. \nAs the <italic>Panic of 1841</italic> destabilized the sheep markets, Australian colonial banks unable to tap British capital markets collapsed, and Joseph Montefiore\u2019s <italic>Montefiore</italic> fell into bankruptcy in Sydney and London. By 1842, <italic>Oppenheim </italic>of Manchester and Hamburg failed. Montefiore\u2019s <italic>Bank of Australasia</italic> soon merged with <italic>Union Bank of Australia</italic> and other banks to form what became ANZ.<italic> </italic>After Joseph returned to London, <italic>Montefiore</italic> resumed by 1844 with assistance from <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. \nWith the discovery of copper in South Australia, Joseph moved there and set up an import and shipping agency with his nephew. Moreover, Joseph invested in copper mines and became a director of <italic>Royal South Australian Mining</italic>. And when Saint-Petersburg denied him residency ostensibly because of his Judaism, Rothschild cousin Benjamin Davidzon traveled across the Atlantic, through the West Indies, Panama, Chile, Peru, and Mexico. To protect free labor sugar, British warships seized Afro-Latin American slavers in 1845.\nAs Parliament banned coal cartels and serfdom domestically and slavery in India, only chartered railroads, the new clearinghouse bank cartel of 1842, and gas PUs by an official act in 1847 escaped free trade. Edinburgh-born Samuel Laing helped shape the <italic>Railway Act of 1844. </italic>He had started out as the private secretary to Henry Baring Labouchere, who became President of <italic>Board of Trade </italic>in 1842, and appointed Laing secretary of railway department. He served on the Railway Commission, and became Chair of <italic>London, Brighton, & South Coast</italic> RR until 1852, when he resigned to enter Parliament.\nSome pundits argued that greater locomotive replacement costs increased a company\u2019s assets without accounting for depreciation. On behalf of <italic>Great Western</italic> RR, William Deloitte popularized the double-entry accounting system. This system was important in Britain\u2019s <italic>Joint Stock Banking Act</italic> in 1844, which made it mandatory for companies to provide balance sheets and income statements. \nWith Parliament extending free incorporation<italic> </italic>that year, accountancies soon formed. Facing barriers due to his Catholic background, William Deloitte, a grandson of a French emigrant from 1793, unquestionably impacted the field. So did other non-conformists. Quaker <italic>London & County Bank</italic> heir William Cooper founded <italic>Cooper</italic>. Samuel Price, founder of <italic>Price Waterhouse</italic>, had a brother married to a Baptist minister\u2019s daughter. Edwin Waterhouse, his partner, was a Quaker who later joined the Church of England. \nWhile <italic>Bank of Ireland</italic> lost her Dublin monopoly in 1845, allowing joint-stock competitors into Dublin, leading to the decline of <italic>Touche</italic> bank, the British <italic>Sugar Duties Act of 1846</italic> reduced the existing duties on sugar, promoting free trade and competition between British plantations using free labor and those outside the British Empire utilizing slaves. Also that year, low tariffs sparked famine in coal-poor Ireland. <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London joined to aid victims and the country.\nWhile BOE Directors, hailing from merchant banks, aimed to regulate commercial activities through counter-cyclical interest rates, colonial merchant bankers held a contrasting incentive\u2014keeping interest rates low. This contrast became more pronounced after the implementation of the <italic>Sugar Duties Act</italic> in 1846, which intensified concerns over foreign competition and eroded confidence in <italic>Reid Irving</italic> and other East Indies sugar banks. Likewise, Ireland\u2019s Great Famine inflated food prices. To rebuild gold after buying Russian grain, BDF and BOE hiked rates in 1847, triggering bank bankruptcies and the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>. The bankruptcies of <italic>Reid Irving</italic> and over twenty Calcutta firms collapsed a record number of BOE directors. Indeed, Britain refused requests to fuel credit by local bankers.\nWhile Parliament protected creditors from holdouts with majority compositions, British bankers adjusted to free trade from protectionism. While Cornish <italic>Grenfell</italic> and <italic>Vivian</italic> cartelized British copper supply, 1840s reforms spurred American and Australian imports. Instead, <italic>Hirsch-G\u00f6ttingen</italic>\u2014by then kinterlinked with a descendant of Simon Bondi\u2014and <italic>Cohen-Barent </italic>increased exports as <italic>Rothschild</italic> linked mercury and other mineral monopiles from Spanish <italic>Almad\u00e9n</italic> to French monopoly rights for Russia\u2019s <italic>Demidov</italic>. \nLike the Grenfell and Smyth families, another dynastic merchant banker was George Norman, with a family history in London commerce dating back to the 18th century when they imported Norwegian timber. He joined BOE in 1821 and remained until 1872. George\u2019s son, Frederick, married Russia trader Mark Collet\u2019s daughter. After Shipley retired in 1850, Collet led <italic>Brown Shipley</italic> from Liverpool, before serving as a BOE director from 1866 until his death in 1905. Frederick\u2019s son, Montagu Norman led BOE from 1920 until 1944. \nAnd in America, the <italic>Panic of 184</italic><italic>8</italic> brought down <italic>Prime</italic>, with blame falling on commodity speculation. As marriages unwound, the partnership restructured and continued to represent <italic>Baring</italic>. Since Boston\u2019s Joshua Bates worked with Thomas Perkins and married Russ Sturgis\u2019 cousin in 1826 to link <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Russell</italic>, Russ Sturgis became a Partner at <italic>Baring</italic> London by 1851. After <italic>Baring</italic> Liverpool\u2019s American-born Partner Samuel Gair secured an apprenticeship for Liverpool cotton trader <italic>Rathbone</italic>\u2019s William Rathbone VI at <italic>Baring</italic> London, Rathbone married Gair\u2019s daughter in 1847. By 1851, <italic>Rathbone</italic> opened a New York agency under Gair\u2019s son.<italic> </italic><italic>Rathbone</italic> soon became the leading Anglo-American bulk grain dealer.\nHowever, British efforts to industrialize India with mines and railroads did not take off. Increasingly, British bankers kinterlinked through aristocrats. Since Charles Grenfell married noble Georgiana Lascelles\u2014a descendant of <italic>Russia Co</italic>\u2019s John Cayley\u2019s second great aunt\u2014in 1852, her cousin Louisa Lascelles married Charles Mills of <italic>Glyn </italic>in 1853. In 1854, Britain ended the ban on usury and allowed credit competition.\nAs coal exports surpassed grain imports, coalers struck across Europe. As impoverished farmers in rural Baden targeted Jewish moneylenders, nobles, and tithe offices, the Jewish community requested. While the Bavarian military sided with the aggressive, Prussia emancipated the Jews of Posen and freed labor spread for Christians in west Prussia.\nLike Hansemann, Camphausen, Kamp, and Schnitzler, Mevissen was elected to the Prussian Parliament in 1847, where they advocated for liberal reforms, supporting a unified Germany and the expansion of the railway system. Along with <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, and <italic>Styn</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Carl Schnitzler, his efforts contributed to link Antwerp railways into <italic>Cologne-Minden</italic> RR under Schnitzler\u2019s leadership to mine and transport coal. While his consortium submitted a statute proposing both coal mining and iron smelting, this proposal was rejected as too broad and insufficiently defined.\nAfter insufficient harvests forced France to buy Russian grain, BDF and BOE hiked rates to rebuild gold from 1847. As Anglo-Russian bank <italic>DeJersey</italic> collapsed in 1847, Bremen-born Ludwig Knoop kinterlinked with <italic>Frericks</italic> of Hamburg and acquired control of <italic>DeJersey</italic> with capital from <italic>Berkfeld.</italic> When <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>suspended payments in 1848, Hansemann and Mevissen gained permission to convert her into a joint-stock and take control. Mevissen\u2019s coal consortium also received a concession without steel integration. While having succeeded in some of his business goals, Mevissen and others withdrew from Parliament to focus on business. \nAlong with financing <italic>Bonn-Cologne</italic> RR and, with Lambert Cah\u00e9n, <italic>Bonn-Coblenz</italic> RR, <italic>Cahn</italic> traded shares in <italic>Stinnes</italic>, a Schweinheim mill, and, with <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> Brussels, <italic>Metallurgical Society</italic>. Although several small German states\u2014including Brunswick, Hessen-Darmstadt, Hessen-Homburg, Nassau, Oldenburg, Saxony, Saxe-Weimar, Waldeck, and Frankfurt\u2014emancipated Jews in 1848, Frankfurt and others revoked these rights, like the dissipated rights Prussia and other German states had granted after the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>.\nAlsace miners revolted amidst the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic> as Laffitte\u2019s <italic>Caisse Generale</italic>, <italic>Eichthal</italic>, and <italic>Haber</italic> failed and <italic>Hottinger</italic>, <italic>Mallet</italic>, <italic>Fould Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris withdrew from the market. So, Napoleon III seized control and rescued industry after the provisional government, appointing the first Jews to the cabinet, with Michel Silny\u2014Isaac Orchel\u2019s grandson, Paris banker, and a leader of the <italic>Revolution of 1830</italic>\u2014as Minister of Finance and Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux as Minister of Justice. As France abolished slavery, she founded <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2014requiring two co-signers for discounting instead of three like BDF\u2019s\u2014to rebuild Parisian credit and to back colonial banks with funds from former slave owners, who became shareholders, expanding business. \nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, French Emperor Napoleon III chartered two banks by 1852: <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>. While the former mortgage bank invested in urban renewal, Pereire led the latter to industrialize Europe. Along with gas and water works, railroads, banks, and industry, <italic>Mobilier</italic> funded <italic>Transatlantique Shipping</italic>. Among <italic>Mobilier</italic>\u2019s founding directors was Napoleon\u2019s half-brother Charles Morny. Interreligious <italic>Mobilier</italic> accelerated mixed kinterlinks. Since Emile Pereire\u2019s daughter married into the Rhon\u00e9 family, which controlled <italic>Anzin</italic>, in 1846, another daughter married Georges Thurneyssen, whose family was related to the old <italic>Gontard</italic> and <italic>Fries</italic> banking houses, in 1853.\nAlthough Pereire offered <italic>Rothschild</italic> a share that did not match the dignity of their house, effectively excluding the latter. While several Oppenheims and in-law Moritz Haber supported <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Mobilier</italic> coordinated Fould Oppenheim, Arnstein Eskeles, Camondo, Sina, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt\u2019s former employee Emile Erlanger, a Hahn cousin of Frankfurt. While Moritz remained in German lands since his father\u2019s bank collapsed, his brothers became bankers elsewhere. Samuel went to Paris, while Louis moved to Vienna, working with his L\u00e4mel in-laws and reorganizing a Bohemian sugar factory with nobles.\nInstead of joining <italic>Mobilier</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris shared many directorates with <italic>Alais</italic> forge owner Denis Benoist d\u2019Azy and his Huguenot ally Francois Bartholony. Founded in 1853, <italic>Co G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux</italic>\u2019 board included diplomat and minister Napol\u00e9on Lannes, Duke of Montebello, Benoist d\u2019Azy, James Rothschild, and Henry Avigdor. For her first President, the Board appointed Count Henri Sim\u00e9on, a senator and former prefect, to secure major contracts in water distribution and infrastructure development across France.  \nLike <italic>Creusot</italic>, <italic>Alais</italic> suffered after the <italic>Panic of 1830</italic>. After narrowly avoiding the disaster, <italic>Alais</italic> closed in 1834 until Denis d\u2019Azy revitalized her. Born in Paris, he began his career as secretary at the Legation of Frankfurt in 1819, later becoming inspector of Finance and then Inspector General by 1825. In 1822, he married Am\u00e9lie d\u2019Azy, whose father owned over 2,500 hectares in Ni\u00e8vre and was a master blacksmith in Vierzon and Saint-Benin d\u2019Azy. Thanks to his father-in-law, Denis gained control of <italic>Alais</italic> and other forges. In 1847, a royal ordinance allowed Denis to add to his wife\u2019s d\u2019Azy surname to his own. \nThe <italic>Panic of 1848</italic> of also pushed Belgium to serve as a fiscal agent and monopolize note issuance from<italic> Bank of Belgium</italic> and SG <italic>Belge</italic>, creating <italic>Belgian</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>in 1850 with investors including <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> Brussels. Since introducing mechanized spinning to Prussia with a British steam engine in 1845, <italic>Mevissen</italic> expanded operations to Belgium in 1849. After Prussia allocated premiums in 1849 to support flax processing for linen, Mevissen and Koenigs established a flax-spinning mill in D\u00fcren in 1851. Having married a textile magnate <italic>Croon</italic>, the Boelling family\u2014relatives of the Bunge, Krupp, and Souchay families\u2014kinterlinked with Frankfurt banker <italic>Metzler</italic>\u2019s affiliate Andreae in 1849 and Anglo-German textile trader <italic>Engels </italic>in 1850. \nAfter Johann Gossler\u2019s daughter married a Meinertzhagen cousin in 1850, his <italic>Amsinck</italic> niece married a Merck in 1854. Amidst a shortage of credit and weaving yarn, <italic>Mevissen</italic>, <italic>Styn</italic>, and their banker allies founded <italic>K\u00f6lnische Baumwollspinnerei</italic> in 1853. However, the same year, textile manufacturers\u2014including <italic>Croon</italic>, <italic>Pferdmenges</italic>, <italic>Brinck</italic> (of unknown relation to Johann Kamp\u2019s banker father-in-law), and Mevissen\u2019s brothers-in-law Koenigs and Specken\u2014founded joint-stock company <italic>Gladbacher Spinnerei</italic> without bankers. \nBy 1852, <italic>Mevissen</italic>\u2019s independent reinsurance company to work with <italic>Colonia</italic><italic> </italic>finally gained approval as the first in Germany, with funding from <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne, <italic>Herstatt</italic>, <italic>Styn</italic>, and <italic>Camphausen</italic>. And after Kamp died in 1853, <italic>Colonia</italic>, having offered exclusively fire insurance, established <italic>Concordia </italic>for life insurance, with <italic>Oppenheim </italic>Cologne and <italic>Styn</italic> linking both boards. As Messiven founded <italic>H\u00f6rde Mining & Smelting Association</italic> as the first integrated mining company in the Rhine and Ruhr, his brother-in-law Koenigs founded <italic>Cologne-M\u00fcsener Mining Association</italic> and secured coal drilling rights with banker<italic> </italic><italic>Styn</italic> and ironmaster <italic>Haniel</italic>.\nBefore gaining control of <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, <italic>Mevissen</italic> had failed to obtain authorization to establish a joint-stock bank in Cologne to support industrial development of Prussian Rhineland-Westphalia in 1845, but revisited the project with <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne after Pereire created <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> in 1852 and moved the headquarters to Darmstadt as <italic>Haber</italic> proposed their own joint-stock company for industrial credit. \nIn 1853, <italic>Mevissen</italic>, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>, and <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic> started Germany\u2019s first industrial bank, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, in 1853. Although half of the capital was French, the directors were from Cologne (including two Oppenheim brothers, Philip Engels, Mevissen with two brothers-in-law, a Styn\u2019s in-law, and two of Deichmann\u2019s in-laws) and Frankfurt (including directors from <italic>Bethmann</italic>, Oppenheim\u2019s in-law <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, and <italic>Metzler</italic>\u2019s affiliates <italic>Goll</italic> and <italic>Schmidt</italic>). \nAlso in 1853, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> co-founded note-issuing banks in the duchies of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Brunswick. While prohibiting <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> and other banks from branching into the financial capital, Frankfurt approved the joint-stock <italic>Frankfurter Vereinskasse</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>application from <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, <italic>Bethmann</italic>, <italic>Donner</italic>, <italic>Ganslandt</italic>, <italic>Goll</italic>, <italic>Neufville</italic>, <italic>Schlamp</italic>, and <italic>Schmidt</italic>. \nAs Frankfurt granted full political (but not civic) equality to Jews in 1854, <italic>Frankfurter </italic>evolved into the central bank <italic>Frankfurter Bank</italic>, was granted note-issuing privileges by the city council, second only to <italic>Prussian Bank</italic>. Within a year, <italic>Mevissen</italic>, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne, and their associates created a note issuing bank for the state of Hesse, <italic>Bank for Southern Germany</italic>.\nMarrying Bertha Schaaffhausen Deichmann in 1855, textile entrepreneur Gustav Mallinckrodt founded <italic>Cologne Private Bank</italic>. As <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> branched out internationally by buying a silent interest in <italic>Ba</italic><italic>w</italic><italic>er</italic> of New York, Oppenheim sought to recruit Gerson Bleichr\u00f6der and his son to start a bank with <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, but he declined. By 1856, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> funded Carl Leiden\u2014Deichmann\u2019s son-in-law and Mevissen\u2019s brother-in-law\u2014and Benjamin Premsel, Hamburg-born a chief clerk of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, in founding <italic>Le</italic><italic>i</italic><italic>den Premsel</italic> with branches in Hamburg and Paris. \nHaving kinterlinked with Dutch <italic>Borski</italic> in 1810, <italic>Bethmann </italic>of Frankfurt\u2019s cousin married American knickerbocker Philip Schulyer\u2019s daughter in 1854. And in Prussian Cologne, along with reinforcing their kinterlink with Anglo-German textile trader <italic>Engels </italic>in 1855, Prussian textile magnate <italic>Croon</italic>\u2019s Boelling in-laws later married their textile partner <italic>Pferdmenges</italic>. Also in 1855, an <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne heir married an Engels\u2014of unknown relation to <italic>Engels</italic>\u2014and established <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne\u2019s Catholic branch. Four years later, his brother wed <italic>Croon</italic>\u2019s in-law, founding this Oppenheim family\u2019s Protestant branch. Kinterlinked with  <italic>Oppenheim</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and <italic>Haber</italic>, <italic>Beyfus</italic><italic> </italic>of Frankfurt restructured as a partnership with <italic>Steiger</italic>\u2014ennobled Christian Swiss in-laws of <italic>Bethmann</italic><italic> </italic>and more extended connections to <italic>Labouch</italic><italic>e</italic><italic>re</italic> and <italic>Pereire</italic>\u2014in 1857.\nWhile German Jews funded industry and <italic>Coppel</italic> participated in it, but not as much as French Jews. Significantly smaller than <italic>Wendel</italic>, <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> played a role in European industry unparalleled by other Jews. From a name indicative of descent from Treves, Dreyfus family were among the first to move to Wissembourg, Alsace, with Lion Dreyfus\u2019 daughter marrying an Aron of Phalsbourg in 1743. \nLikely Lion\u2019s cousin, Aron Dreyfus died in 1798, and his widow married a brother of Jacques Javal. Originally from Alsace and trained in Mulhouse, Jacques Javal and his brother moved to Paris, where they founded a bank and a painted cloth factory in 1819. In 1822, Javal, alongside Jacques and Martin Laffitte, shipped their goods to Australia, China, and Spanish California. This group also initiated a limited partnership society for industry in 1824, which King Charles X thwarted. \nAlso in 1822, Jacques\u2019 nephew married a Goudchoux descendant and founded a trading house in Rio de Janeiro. Jacques\u2019 influences also grew as he presided over the <italic>Consistory</italic> from 1824 to 1829, while his bank funded local textile mills and supported railway projects, notably those of the Koechlin and Schlumberger families. In 1835, Javal\u2019s son Leo took over the family business, marrying an Eichthal in 1838. By 1845, he increased the capital threefold, diversifying into coal, canals, and railways, including the lines from Strasbourg to Thann and Basel. \nRestructuring Koechlin\u2019s debts during the recession after the <italic>Panic of </italic><italic>1839</italic>, Leo shifted to agriculture, acquiring properties in Yonne and Landes by the 1850s. He served as general councilor for Gironde in 1851, deputy for Yonne from 1857 to 1871, and represented Alsace in the <italic>Consistory</italic> from 1853 to 1870.  And Koechlin, along with <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne, founded <italic>Mining, Lead</italic><italic>,</italic><italic> </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Zinc Manufacturing</italic><italic> Co</italic> in Stolberg and Westphalia, <italic>Ice Co</italic> of Aachen, and <italic>Mining and Metallurgical Operations</italic> in 1853.\nIn 1810, Aron Dreyfus\u2019 son Gaspard married Estelle Dupont, who descended from a Cahen of Metz and was Hayem Worms\u2019 cousin twice removed. While their son wed a descendant of Aron of Phalsbourg in 1834, another cousin, Adolphe, married the daughter of Estelle Dupont\u2019s brother Auguste in 1836. Auguste, along with his son and son-in-law Adolphe, started <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> to vend timber and coal in Metz before becoming iron masters by a rented a monastic forge in Ardennes. Between buying the forges of Apremont in 1837 and Champigneulle in 1846, <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> entered the Lorraine steel industry by buying the Saint-Benoit factory in Ars-sur-Moselle and, after the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, founded another factory and built a blast furnace by 1850. \nBy then, Auguste Dupont\u2019s brother Olry joined the jewelry trade, and Olry\u2019s son became a notary in Arcueil, near Paris, where he practiced from 1847. While Gaspard Dreyfus\u2019 nephew d a daughter of Madame Kaulla\u2019s widowed son-in-law and a descendant of Lion Halphen Goudchaux in 1845, Auguste Dupont\u2019s son married Kaulla\u2019s relative Adele Sciama Ratisbonne, a descendant from Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, Samson Wertheim, Cerf Berr, <italic>Boas</italic>, and the Chief Rabbi of Aleppo Sciama. His wife\u2019s cousin, Joseph Foa Sciama, became one of the founding engineers of <italic>Suez Canal</italic> and served as the Minister of Public Works for the Viceroy of Egypt. Through the old Italian Foa family, the Sciamas were relatives of Hippolyte Gradis Rodrigues. \nOf unknown relation to the Dreyfus family of Wissembourg\u2014but kinterlinked by the 18th century through the Bernheims\u2014Isaac Dreyfu\u00df of Alsace received a residence permit in Swiss Basel in 1812, where he founded trading house<italic> Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel. A year after his son joined the business in 1839, his daughter married a Lazard cousin Picard. Isaac died in 1845, and the business became a limited partnership, with Isaac\u2019s widow fought a legal battle to retain her place in the company and became a limited partner. \nAfter their son Jacques married a Jeidel of Frankfurt\u2014whose siblings banked and kinterlinked with <italic>Ellissen</italic> and <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>\u2014in 1848, the family started a silk ribbon factory in 1853. Around the same time, Isaac\u2019s extended cousin Leo Dreyfu\u00df of Alsace, began transporting grain to Basel in 1850, and established his grain trading business in Basel in 1852, later adopting the hyphenated surname <italic>Louis-Dreyfu\u00df </italic>and moving to Zurich.\nA descendant of Katz-Lwow, Goudchaux, and Kulp, Louis Weil married an Oppenheim of Hamburg in 1844 and became one of the few Jews on <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2019s board from 1852. From 1854, France privatized <italic>Comptoir</italic>, which soon joined the Pereire group. While sharing boards with <italic>Rothschild</italic> in many sectors, Pereire held exclusive positions in <italic>Mobilier</italic>,<italic> Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Creusot</italic>, and <italic>Parisienne du Gaz</italic>. The latter<italic> </italic>formed by 1855. Although Swiss Vincent Duboche pioneered Parisian gas in 1837, he had five competitors before consolidating into <italic>Parent Schake</italic> with investment from <italic>Mallet</italic>, <italic>Hentsch</italic>, <italic>L</italic><italic>essert</italic>, <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic>, and <italic>Warburg</italic>. \nAfter receiving aid from <italic>Rothschild</italic> London cousins in 1844, Joseph Montefiore moved to Adelaide in 1846, embarking on new business ventures. He advocated for Jewish rights in Adelaide in 1847 and was a trustee of <italic>South Australian State Savings Bank</italic> in 1848. Joseph\u2019s political career began in 1851, though he was defeated, coinciding with the discovery of gold in New South Wales and Victoria, igniting the <italic>Australian Gold Rush</italic>. Subsequent discoveries in Victoria, including Mount Alexander, Ballarat, and Bendigo, revealed extensive gold deposits. Joseph Montefiore became <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Australia agent.\nBy 1853, <italic>Rothschild</italic> secured a strategic lease on <italic>Royal Mint Refinery </italic>in London, driven by the substantial gold flow from Victoria, which more than doubled the existing influx from California. For the next century, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s <italic>Royal Mint Refinery </italic>split refining with <italic>Johnson </italic>and <italic>Rapha\u00ebl</italic>. However, by 1855, Joseph Montefiore faced financial troubles and bankruptcy, defaulting on substantial advances from <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. \nDespite this setback, over the next decade, most of gold extracted from central Victoria continued to flow through <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. Along with <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid</italic>, <italic>Samuel</italic> <italic>Montagu</italic>\u2014unaffiliated with Katz-Samuel-Rothschild or Governor Montagu\u2019s families\u2014started brokering bullion in 1853. Combining brokerage with banking, his success led to kinterlink with <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>\u2019s Cohen-Barent by 1862.\n<italic>Rothschild</italic> engaged agents in satellite cities, including <italic>Hambro</italic> in Copenhagen, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> in Berlin, and <italic>Behrens</italic> in Hamburg. After <italic>Behrens</italic>\u2019 cousin Solomon Behrens married Anne Lucas by 1816, her brother Philip wed Moses Montefiore\u2019s niece Juliana Gomperz in 1836. As other relatives failed in the Manchester cloth trade, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London retained <italic>Behrens</italic> and sent his son there as a trainee. <italic>Behrens</italic> branched from Hamburg and Manchester to China and India as heir Jacob Behrens kinterlinked with <italic>Ladenburg</italic> in 1844.\nMarrying a daughter of Salomon Lorch, the richest Jew of Mainz\u2014a great aunt of August Belmont\u2014Wolf Ladenburg,  of the city of Mannheim in the Dutchy Baden, established <italic>Ladenburg</italic> in 1785, focusing on coin exchange and jewel trading. After <italic>Hohenemser</italic> bank started in 1792, Ladenburg\u2019s sister married Hirsch Hohenemser in 1793, and their daughter wed cousin Joseph Ladenburg Hohenemser around 1817. \nWolf\u2019s son Selig married Julie Goldschmidt in 1823 and joined <italic>Ladenburg</italic> in 1832. He co-founded <italic>Wagh\u00e4usel</italic> sugar factory in 1836, <italic>Steam Tugboat Co</italic> in 1842, and bought land where BASF developed.  When Selig\u2019s son Carl took over<italic> Ladenburg</italic>, he founded Europe\u2019s largest pulp factory and served on the boards of <italic>Badische Bank</italic> and <italic>Baden Sugar Co</italic>. Joining <italic>Hohenemser</italic> in 1820, Joseph Ladenburg Hohenemser wed his daughter to Jacob Behrens in 1844. Joseph and his cousin and brother-in-law Selig developed Mannheim and beyond.\nTwo years later, Ludwig Ladenburg married Vienna banker Leo L\u00e4mel\u2019s daughter. In 1850, Selig Ladenburg\u2019s daughter married Ferdinand Beit of Hamburg, who worked as a director at <italic>Elbe Copper Works</italic> and was a brother-in-law of Warburg. Likewise, <italic>Ladenburg</italic> branched to London and Frankfurt. Marrying the daughter of a Halphen and Frankfurt banker Maurice Flersheim, Emil Ladenburg established <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Frankfurt in 1852. \nActing as <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s satellite bank in Amsterdam since 1838, <italic>Sichel</italic> sunset in 1853 as Elias Fuld, a cousin of the Sichel, Speyer, Goldschmidt, and Rothschild families, partnered with Carl Becker, a <italic>Sichel</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt alum born to Catholic and Protestant parents, to found <italic>Becker Fuld</italic>. Since Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s niece married Mozes Nijmegen Ezechiels\u2014a brother-in-law of the Goldsmids\u2014who founded <italic>Ezechiels</italic> in Rotterdam in 1781, <italic>Ezechiels</italic> became <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s correspondent of that city. Joining <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschimidt</italic>, <italic>Rapha\u00ebl</italic><italic>, </italic>and others, <italic>Ezechiels</italic> co-founded <italic>Amsterdamse Crediet</italic> in 1853 for small manufacturers and merchants. By 1854, Ezechiels\u2019 granddaughter married Amsterdam diamond Emanuel Brandon Vita-Israel. Emanuel took over his family\u2019s long diamond mining, cutting, and international trade business. \nLike <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> in Cologne, an early French imitator of Pereires\u2019 <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> was his fellow Bordeaux Sephardi. Having bought a railway-focused newspaper in 1848, Jules Mir\u00e8s expanded into gas distribution and established an investment trust in 1850 that he reorged into <italic>Railway Fund</italic> in 1853. As Mir\u00e8s secured contracts to develop ports and gas PUs in Marseilles, he obtained railway concessions in the Papal States and formed <italic>Roma</italic> RR with Roman nobles and raised <italic>Railway Fund</italic>\u2019s capital by 1856. \nAlso in 1853, <italic>Eskeles</italic>, <italic>Brandeis</italic>, and others founded <italic>Lower Austrian Discount </italic><italic>Bank</italic> in Vienna as a mobilier. Along with Joseph Montefiore\u2019s struggle, 1855 was a sad one for the Rothschild family. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s lead Solomon Rothschild and his brothers in Naples and Frankfurt died in 1855, <italic>Mobilier</italic> rushed into Austria, Naples, and elsewhere. United against <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Mobilier</italic><italic></italic><italic></italic><italic></italic>-affiliated <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic>,<italic> Sina</italic>, and Hungarian Count Fran\u00e7ois Zichy of Vienna\u2014a cousin-in-law of Austrian Count Metternich and Hungary\u2019s first PM\u2014built a railway into the Austrian frontier, joining Huguenots in 1855 to start <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR and link Vienna to Constantinople.\nAs <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic><italic> </italic>bid on <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna monopolized credit into a bank, <italic>Creditanstalt, </italic>with directors including Goldschmidt, Wertheim, K\u00f6nigswarter, Oppenheim, Haber, and L\u00e4mel  in-laws joined Austrian princes F\u00fcrstenberg, Schwarzenberg and Auersperg. Joined the Board of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, <italic>Behrens</italic>\u2019 Paul Schiff of Oder\u2014and unknown relation to the Frankfurt Schiffs\u2014kinterlinked with <italic>Warburg</italic>. The same year, a Halphen-K\u00f6nigswarter of Paris wed a Worms Rodrigues of Bordeaux, Pereire\u2019s extended cousin. While more Halphens kinterlinked with an Oppenheim of Hamburg and joined the <italic>Consistory of Paris</italic>, one wed a Speyer cousin Stern. \n<italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris collaborated with <italic>Hirsch</italic>, <italic>Eichthal</italic>, and <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> on Bavarian and German roads as Austria negotiated <italic>Lombard-Venetian & Central Italian</italic> RR with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>\u2019s Schwarzenberg, Genoese noble Ferrari, Scottish <italic>Baring</italic>-ally Samuel Laing, Matthew Uzielli of London\u2019s <italic>Devaux</italic>, Tuscan banker Pietro Bastogi, Count Zichy, Edward Blount, and Paulin Talabot, most of whom had partnered together on French railroads in the 1840s. \nAgainst <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris established <italic>R\u00e9union Financi\u00e8re</italic> by early 1856 with Bischoffsheim\u2019s in-law Joseph Cah\u00e9n, French Huguenots, <italic>Laffitte Blount</italic>, <italic>Schneider</italic>, <italic>Talabot</italic>, Fran\u00e7ois Bartholony, and other allies. However, a credit crunch threatened French railway construction and the overall economy. One reason such crunches resulted from poor credit intermediation. While BDF had only thirteen branches nationally as recently as 1848, France lacked private branched deposit banks as Napoleon\u2019s <italic>Commercial</italic> <italic>Code</italic> banned British-style checks. \nSupported by BOE\u2019s governor, William Gladstone rallied British financiers to reorg <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Docks </italic>and link her to an international commercial credit bank. While having partnered with cousin-in-law <italic>Gladstone</italic> <italic>Gillanders</italic> <italic>Ogilvy</italic> in EIC trade in the 1820s, the Gladstones switched to <italic>Thomson Bonar</italic> to ship Baltic grain to Liverpool. Representing the London firm <italic>Thomson Bonar</italic> in France, William Gladstone served on the board of <italic>Paris-Orl\u00e9ans</italic> RR. \nLikewise, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris requested authorization for a large discount and loan bank, <italic>Imperial Counter for Public Works, Trade, & Industry</italic>. William\u2019s cousin, Ewart began as a Member of Parliament in 1832, before following Jewish Mendes and Bassevi cousin Benjamin Disraeli to become <italic>Exchequer</italic> Chancellor in 1852, which he continued with until 1866 except when his party lost the government the three years after 1855.\nWhile <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne, <italic>Mevissen</italic>, and <italic>Erlanger</italic> started <italic>Bank of Luxembourg</italic><italic> </italic>in 1856,  Dutch commerce lagged Antwerp and Belgian railways. Since the 1840s, economic liberalism dominated Dutch policy, opposing state involvement in industry. In 1856, four proposals for a cr\u00e9dit mobilier type-bank\u2014including one by <italic>K\u00f6nigswarter</italic> and Jewish bankers from Amsterdam\u2014were submitted, but the government, advised by <italic>Nederlandsche Bank</italic>, rejected them. Likewise, the government held that state aid for railway construction should only be applied in urgent cases. \nAs the Amsterdam subsidiary of <italic>Bank of Luxembourg</italic>, Leo Lippmann formed <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic>, in 1859, with George Rosenthal, a descendant of Joseph Goldschmidt and a fourth cousin of Amschel Rothschild. While Rosenthal\u2019s brother-in-law married a Martha Cahn Daniels, Lippmann\u2019s brother married a great-grandson of Aisik Orchel, second great-grandson of Lion Goudchaux Halphen, and sister-in-law of Michel Silny.\nSince 1853, Goldschmidt-in-law Jonathan Bischoffsheim joined <italic>Royal Asturian Mines</italic> and Pereire to co-found <italic>Society to Produce Zinc</italic> <italic>of Spain</italic>. As <italic>Mobilier</italic> founded <italic>Credito</italic> in Spain, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris followed with <italic>Sociedad Espanola Mercantil & Industrial</italic>. As Spanish mercantile families kinterlinked with Lopez-Dorigas, formerly <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Santander agent, they soon formed <italic>Banco Santander</italic>.\nSwiss banking saw the formation of several private banks to meet the credit needs of the railroad and manufacturing industries. Since co-founding <italic>Comptoir</italic>, Liberal Genevan politician James Fazy, a son of a Huguenot manufacturer, politician, and ally of the Hentsch family, organized <italic>Banque G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Suisse  </italic>in<italic> </italic>1853 and contributed to the construction of railway lines connecting Lyon, Lausanne, and Saint-Maurice. Within a year, six private bankers in Catholic Basel established <italic>Basler </italic><italic>Bank</italic> to address these demands. \nAnd in Huguenot Zurich, after Henri Escher\u2019s son, Alfred, and two other companies promoted Swiss railways in the 1850s, Pereire and Rothschild acquired shares from 1855. Concerned about foreign capital in Swiss railways, Alfred Escher partnered with Swiss businessmen and politicians to receive a concession. By 1856, Switzerland\u2019s first commercial bank, <italic>Schweizerische Kreditanstalt</italic> (\u201c<italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u201d) started with Escher as her leader, with the aim of consolidating the Swiss railway system under local ownership. Like the private Swiss banks, the founding families remained on <italic>Credit Suisse</italic>\u2019s board for over a century.\nThe cr\u00e9dit mobilier idea peaked in 1856 as private bankers across Europe, with ten in Germany. That year, <italic>Prussian Bank</italic> gained the authority to increase its share capital and remove the limit on note issues, leading to over a dozen <italic>Mobilier</italic>-type banks, such as <italic>Allgemeiner </italic>of Leipzig and <italic>Vereinsbank</italic> of Hamburg. Despite restrictions on joint-stock banks, limited partnerships with transferable shares facilitated growth. The first joint-stock bank in Northern Germany, <italic>Norddeutsche Bank</italic> started in Hamburg that year with investment from<italic> Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne, <italic>Heine</italic>, <italic>Berenberg Gossler</italic>, and <italic>Merck</italic>, the latter two Christian bankers having founded <italic>Hamburg-American </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> in 1847 and insurer <italic>Lloyd</italic> Norddeutsche<italic> </italic>in 1857.\nFounded by Heinrich Fromberg, Wilhelm Lehfeldt, and Count Adrian Hoverden, <italic>Schlesische</italic> of Breslau engaged in banking, trade, and industrial investment, including financing Silesian noble families who controlled estates with coal and iron ore deposits. Likewise, <italic>Mitteldeutsche Credit</italic> as Saxe-Meiningen\u2019s note-issuing monopoly with an agency in Frankfurt and investment from <italic>K\u00f6nigswarter</italic>, Rothschild cousins <italic>Schwarzschild</italic> of Frankfurt, and <italic>Sulzbach</italic><italic> </italic>of Frankfurt. Siegmund Sulzbach founded <italic>Sulzbach</italic><italic> </italic>after marrying a descendant of Joseph Goldschmidt in 1851. His F\u00fcrth-born father was admitted by Frankfurt as a merchant in 1812 and became an exchange broker in 1822 after marrying an extended Oppenheim cousin. \nSince Moritz Salomonsohn\u2014the son of a famous rabbi of Prussian Poland and his wife, a Katz-cousin Solomon Luria descendant and sister of Posen salt industrialist Michael Levy\u2014co-founded Berlin commercial bank <italic>Disconto</italic> with Christians in 1851, David Hansemann\u2014who helped reorg <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>with <italic>Mevissen</italic> and managed <italic>Prussian Bank</italic>\u2014reorganized her into a <italic>Mobilier</italic>-type joint-stock bank with funding from <italic>Styn</italic> in 1856. After Hansemann approached them, <italic>Mevissen</italic>, <italic>Schickler</italic>, <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Warschauer</italic>,<italic> </italic>and Friedrich Frankel Magnus funded the new joint-stock <italic>Berliner</italic> in Berlin. \nIn 1857, David Hansemann\u2019s eldest son Adolph joined <italic>Disconto</italic> as a partner. Likewise, <italic>Disconto </italic>extended power of attorney to Meyer Goldsmith. Of unknown relation to the Goldschmidt family, Meyer\u2019s brother-in-law was Joseph Stargardt, a former partner of Paul Reuter. Reuter was born Israel Josaphat as the third son of Rabbi Samuel Josaphat of Kassel and clerked at his uncle\u2019s Gottingen bank. \nConverting to Protestantism, he changed his name to Paul Reuter, and married a daughter of Friedrich Frankel Magnus, who funded his ventures. A year after taking over a Berlin publishing business in 1847, he fled to Paris amidst the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic> due to charges of spreading \u2018democratic\u2019 pamphlets, where he worked as a translator for Charles-Louis Havas\u2019 news agency. In 1841, Reuter moved to London and established <italic>Reuter</italic> new agency with funding from <italic>Erlanger</italic>.\nAt least some of the construction resulted from the <italic>Crimean War</italic>, which disrupted the Anglo-Greek Ukrainian grain trade in the Mediterranean, inflating prices and necessitating over-land transport. While acquiring a railway from Prussian Silesia to Krakau, Austria extended the road to Galician Lemberg, halting at Premissel. In 1856, the government offered the concession to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s group, who declined due to financial conflicts with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>. So, Radziwill cousin Prince Leon Sapieha and other Galicia landowners secured a concession.\nMeanwhile, France extended BDF\u2019s note-issuing monopoly in early 1857, doubling her capital. As BDF issued smaller denomination notes, lent on railway shares, and established branches in every department, reaching 74 by 1870. While these changes generally protected French credit during the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic> as capital fled Europe and depleted bank reserves. Jewish bankers kinterlinked with Catholics connected to BDF. As converted banker Emile Erlanger married Catholic banker Charles Laffitte\u2019s daughter in 1858, Adolphe Fould wed the daughter of Roch Ledoux, who had succeeded his father as a judge at the Commercial Court of the Seine and a member of BDF\u2019s discount committee in 1833.\nPut on hold during the crisis, Napoleon III intervened to revive Gladstone\u2019s international commercial bank project for France in 1859. <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> started under French banker Armand Donon with investors including <italic>Gladstone Gillanders Ogilvy</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Schneider</italic>, and <italic>Berliner</italic>. Along with bankers, founding directors included Lyons silk merchant Arl\u00e8s-Dufour, head of <italic>Fourchambault</italic> and director of <italic>Caisse Baudon</italic> Hochet, directors of <italic>Co des Mines de la Loire</italic> tax collecting heir Adrien Delahante, public works contractor <italic>Parent</italic>, gas and coal industry contractor <italic>Dehaynin</italic>, and shipbuilder <italic>Montan\u00e9</italic>. At the suggestion of Gladstone to Napoleon, <italic>Industriel</italic>\u2019s first President was Marquis Gaston d\u2019Audiffret, who banked after the Revolution ruined him.\nWhile <italic>Disconto</italic> and <italic>Berliner</italic> survived, many of the new banks failed in the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>.  In November 1857 the financial crisis that began in America reached Hamburg. On December 4 the Hamburg Senate established a 15-million-<italic>mark banco</italic> fund, composed of 5 million in city bonds and 10 million in silver to be borrowed abroad. Loan requests were sent to <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, and <italic>Hambro</italic> in London, to <italic>Fould</italic> in Paris, and to financial authorities in Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Brussels, Berlin, Dresden, and Hanover, but all were refused. \nBy the 8th, all banks except <italic>Heine</italic> faced insolvency, and commercial activity had halted. That day Vienna offered the required silver, and a train carrying the bullion, arrived soon after. Loans were made to <italic>Merck</italic>, <italic>Berenberg Gossler</italic>, <italic>Donner</italic>, <italic>Merck</italic>, and several smaller firms. The crisis ended on the 12th when normal payments resumed. As an emergency measure against excessive bill discounting during the crisis, Hamburg\u2019s senate founded <italic>Garantie </italic>with investment from <italic>Heine</italic>, <italic>Warburg</italic>, and <italic>Behrens</italic>. Since <italic>Behrens</italic>\u2019 cousin-in-law married Moses Montefiore\u2019s niece Juliana Gomperz in 1836, the daughter from that union married <italic>Behrens</italic>\u2019 cousin in 1861. \nAfter the founder of <italic>Peine</italic>\u2014an iron mining and smelting company near Hanover\u2014committed suicide in 1857, the founder\u2019s nephew reorganized the firm with investment from <italic>Berenberg Gossler </italic>the following year. Since Johann Gossler\u2019s <italic>Amsinck</italic> niece married a Merck in 1854, <italic>Merck</italic> Partner Justus Merck Ruperti\u2019s daughter married, in 1860, William O\u2019Swald, a partner of <italic>Hertz</italic> heir Adolph Hertz. Since Hertz has converted to Lutheranism in 1822 and became a shipper, his son Ferdinand traveled to East Africa, Arabia, and East India. The family ended the African and general trade in 1859 and invested in shipping and a shipyard. By 1863, Ferdinand married Johann Gossler\u2019s niece.\nWithdrawing from managing <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic><italic> </italic>in 1857, Wilhelm Deichmann co-founded the private bank <italic>Deichmann</italic> in Cologne with his cousin-in-law and <italic>Styn</italic>-in-law Adolph Rath. Since his son-in-law (and Gustav Mevissen\u2019s brother-in-law) co-founded <italic>Leiden Premsel</italic> in Paris and Hamburg, Deichmann saw his son join <italic>Horstman</italic> in London and his brother establish <italic>Deichmann</italic> Amsterdam. Likewise, his friend Adalbert Delbr\u00fcck married <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>-kinterlinked <italic>Warschauer</italic>\u2019s niece-in-law and became a banker in Berlin.\nAlong with <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne, Christian dominated Cologne finance, including <italic>Herstatt</italic>, <italic>Styn</italic>, <italic>Camphausen</italic>, and <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>. Still small Jewish private banks started and grew with family, particularly after the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>. Since clerking as <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne\u2019s cashier, Abraham Levy founded <italic>Levy</italic> in 1858. His son had expanded the family\u2019s influence through his marriage to Johana Coppel in 1852, linking the family to the Coppel steel and weapons manufacturing business. Another relative of the Oppenheims, <italic>Cahn</italic> of Bonn kinterlinked with Amsterdam banker Goldschmidt Rindskopf in 1854 and Frankfurt banker Wertheim in 1860.\nSince Habsburg Mint Jew Jakob Bassevi\u2019s descendant had been a Court Jew to the Counts of Kaunitz in Westphalia, his progeny, Simon Hirschland, traded in goods, real estate, and bills of exchange in Essen, he married an in-law of the Wertheim and Hirsch families and founded a bank in 1841 as coal and steel expanded. By 1856, <italic>Hi</italic><italic>r</italic><italic>schland</italic> took part in the Ruhr\u2019s founding period, servicing <italic>Krupp</italic> and others, and the Essen stock exchange. \nHirschland\u2019s second cousin once removed through the Bassevi and Kaunitz Court Jews, Louis Eltzbacher, married a Frankfurt-born descendant of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister and founded Amsterdam bank <italic>Eltzbacher</italic> in 1852. A year after Louis opened <italic>Eltzbacher</italic> in Cologne in 1858, his sister married a Kaulla. And after an <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne heiress married Polish Saxon banker Felix Zbytkower Frankel Kaskele in 1857, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne instigated the Kaskeles to form Saxon<italic> </italic>central bank <italic>S\u00e4chsische</italic> in Dresden with investment from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, and others in 1865. \nBy 1861, David Hansemann\u2019s son Adolph wed Salomon Oppenheim\u2019s granddaughter, Emma Oppenheim Kusserow, the baptized daughter of a Prussian General Lieutenant.<italic> </italic>After an-law of Hansemann\u2019s Fremery wife and <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Deichmann kinterlinked with <italic>Haniel</italic> by 1862, a Deichmann wed Mevissen\u2019s brother-in-law, and Mevissen\u2019s daughter married a <italic>Styn</italic> heir. While Adolph later led <italic>Disconto</italic>, David\u2019s brother-in-law was <italic>Disconto</italic>\u2019s early procurist. Adolph\u2019s brother worked in the textile industry and represented <italic>Disconto</italic> on boards, like <italic>Bergisch-M\u00e4rkische Bank</italic> in Elberfeld. His more distant relatives Carl Senff and Gerhard Sachau directed <italic>Aachener </italic>and <italic>Leipzig</italic><italic>er</italic>, respectively.\nAfter David Hansemann died in 1864, the company shifted from lending to merchants and craftsmen to providing full banking services. Meyer Goldsmith, who had power of attorney since 1857, became a partner in 1864. In 1869, Goldsmith resigned due to health reasons, and the company appointed three new business owners: Johannes Miquel, Emil Hecker, and Adolph Salomonsohn, whose became<italic> Disconto</italic>\u2019s counsel in 1863 since his brother Moritz co-founded <italic>Disconto</italic> in 1851. \n<italic>Disconto</italic> soon broke into Prussian railways and Austrian and Bavarian state debt syndicates with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Warschauer</italic>, and <italic>Berliner.</italic> After Miquel resigned in 1873, Salomonsohn took a central role. Goldsmith remained on the board until his death in 1884. In 1864, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> kinterlinked with <italic>Lippmann Rosenthal</italic> of<italic> </italic>Amsterdam<italic>.</italic>\nBy then, Gerson Bleichr\u00f6der became the banker of Prussian President, Junker Otto Bismarck. Although Bismarck became a conservative antisemitic politician in the newly created Prussian legislature of 1847, he became Prussia\u2019s Ambassador to Russia and France by 1857 and sought a Jewish banker. Upon the recommendation of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, Bismarck hired Bleichr\u00f6der. \nSoon after <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> began stabilizing German coal and iron with cartels. As French backers abandoned the insolvent <italic>Belgium-Luxembourg</italic> RR, <italic>Hirsch</italic> saved the company in 1859 by convincing Otto Bismarck of its strategic importance. Since the Prussian government owned the Ruhr and Saar coal lands, and Bleichr\u00f6der suggested to Bismarck that the Saar coal be privatized. According to reports, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris was interested in acquiring the Saar coal mines since 1861, but Bismarck declined. Instead, Bismarck entrusted Bleichr\u00f6der to begin buying private coal roads competing with the state. \nWhen the Prussian Parliament refused to finance Prussia in the <italic>Austro-Prussian War</italic><italic> of 1866</italic>, Bleichr\u00f6der found financing by redeeming the state\u2019s share in <italic>Cologne-Minden </italic>RR instead of a loan. Against the <italic>Treaty of Chaumont</italic>, Bismarck sought to unify the German states. By 1866, Prussia defeated joint Austrian and Bavarian forces. Within a year, Bismarck united North German states, Frankfurt, and other principalities. As French Emperor Napoleon III moved to seize the Prussian Ruhr in 1870. However, as he lost the <italic>Franco-Prussian War,</italic> ending Napoleon\u2019s reign and <italic>Second French Empire</italic> a year later.\nInstead, the wars allowed for the formation of a Prussian-led German Empire, without Austria. As Prussian law spread, Frankfurt experienced an economic upswing, marking its transition into an industrial hub, and Jewish emancipation from the ghetto allowed nationwide freedom of movement and citizenship, creating a uniform legal framework for civil equality. This framework extended to southern states by 1871. While Bismarck switched bankers from <italic>Rothschild</italic> to Bleichr\u00f6der, <italic>Prussian Bank</italic>,<italic> Frankfurter Bank</italic>, and other note-issuers continued until fusing into <italic>Reichsbank</italic> (\u201cGRB\u201d) in 1876.\nSince his cousins kinterlinked with the Oppenheim Friedl\u00e4nd and Synger families<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic>Bleichr\u00f6der had replaced <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> as <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Berlin agent in the late 1820s, <italic>Rothschild</italic> had to replace him as he served Bismarck. <italic>While Oppenheim Warschauer </italic>became independent from <italic>Oppenheim </italic>K\u00f6nigsberg in 1867, they continued to work together. Moving to Berlin, <italic>Oppenheim </italic>served as <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Berlin representation. Robert Warschauer opened the Berlin branch of <italic>Warschauer</italic> in 1849, with Eduard Synger\u2014a descendant of Koppel Frankel and cousin of the Mendelssohns\u2014as co-founder. The firm merged with five other banks in 1859 to form the Prussian Consortium under <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>. After Warschauer withdrew from business in the 1870s, Sygner led the firm.\nSince marrying a Jeidel of Frankfurt\u2014and so kinterlinking with <italic>Ellissen</italic> and <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>\u2014<italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel founder\u2019s son Jacques established <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Frankfurt in 1868. His son, Isaac, joined in 1870 after completing his apprenticeship at <italic>Warburg</italic> in Hamburg. Jacques\u2019s experience in Basel gave the firm strong Swiss banking connections, distinguishing it from local banks. That year, Jacques\u2019 daughter married Jacob Schiff\u2019s brother. The company focused on brokerage, arbitration, and securities trading, stabilizing the currency after the 1870 French war reparations. Isaac became a partner in 1872.\nAs <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> developed in Protestant Zurich, Catholic Basel and other Swiss banks and states followed. While <italic>Bank in Winterthur</italic> emerged in Zurich\u2019s industrial city, private bankers founded <italic>Basler Handel</italic> in 1862, These early big banks represented only 14% of total assets in 1870, with local, cantonal, mortgage, and savings banks dominating. The Christian and Jewish bankers also worked together. Since converted Austrian Jew, Moritz Grossmann moved to Swiss Saint-Gallen in 1858, he became Director of insurer <italic>Helvetia</italic>. Born in rural Galicia in 1830, Grossmann worked at <italic>Generali</italic> in Trieste and Vienna. To end insurance premiums exports, Grossmann co-founded a local reinsurer,<italic> Swiss Re</italic> in Zurich, in 1863 with <italic>Credit Suisse</italic> financing, and transport insurer <italic>Italia</italic> in Genoa in 1871. \nBy 1872, <italic>Berliner </italic>transformed <italic>Basler </italic><italic>Bank</italic> from 1854 into a joint stock. <italic>Basler </italic>soon appointed a Jewish director, Carl Uffenheimer. His ancestor Jonathan Uffenheimer immigrated from Innsbruck, Austria, to Hohenems on the Swiss border in 1725. He became Court Jew to the Counts of Hohenems and later as community leader. While one son married Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s descendant, another son, Maier, succeeded him as leader. Later, Maier\u2019s daughters married a descendant of Samson Wertheim and Herz Brettauer, a Hohenems jeweler and money exchanger. From 1837, the Brettauers traded leather, later shifting to banking. After the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Brettauer kinterlinked with Dreyfu\u00df.\nWhile  his affiliate James Fazy co-founded <italic>Comptoir</italic>, Henri Hentsch\u2019s grandson, Charles headed <italic>Hentsch</italic> in Paris from 1853 for decades, served as Geneva\u2019s municipal councilor from 1858 to 1862, and was President of <italic>Geneva Gas Co</italic> from 1866. His cousin \u00c9douard Hentsch moved to London to work in trading and banking in 1852. He later became a partner and director of <italic>Hentsch</italic> and, in 1863, co-founded <italic>Dutch</italic> <italic>Bank of Credit & Deposit</italic>. The following year, he participated in the creation of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>. \nAfter <italic>Dutch</italic> <italic>Bank of Credit & Deposit </italic>fused with <italic>Bank of Paris</italic> in 1872, Hentsch became a director of the merged entity, <italic>Bank of Paris & Netherlands </italic>(\u201c<italic>Paribas</italic>\u201d). From that year, Hentsch was President of <italic>Comptoir</italic>, promoted <italic>Swiss Railway Industry Society</italic> and <italic>Swiss Railway Bank</italic>, and co-founded <italic>Union Financi\u00e8re</italic>. In 1875, he also became the first president of <italic>Indochine </italic>while his brother Ernest led <italic>Hentsch</italic> from 1879. \nAnd Henri Hentsch\u2019s old partners led Genevan private bank <italic>Lombard</italic> and served on<italic> Swiss National Bank</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Executive Committee. Eug\u00e8ne Go\u00fcin was another <italic>Paribas</italic> co-founder and director. Born into a Touraine banking family that kinterlinked with nobility, his second cousin was an engineer who married an Eichthal sister-in-law Rodrigues in 1845 and founded rail equipment producer <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles</italic> in Clichy and Mulhouse with funding from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Pereire</italic>, and <italic>Eichthal </italic>in 1847.\nCarl Tietgen was another Christian co-founder of <italic>Paribas</italic>. Tietgen apprenticed in Odense, and in 1848 traveled to Manchester to work. He returned to Denmark in 1855 and established <italic>Tietgen</italic> in Copenhagen. In 1857, he was appointed director of <italic>Privatbanken</italic>. During the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>, Tietgen arranged liquidity loans for distressed trading houses. Tietgen then founded or co-founded <italic>Danske S\u00f8fartsselskab</italic> (1865), <italic>Kryolith Mine & Trading Co</italic> (1865), <italic>Copenhagen Tram Co</italic> (1866), <italic>United Steamship</italic> (1866), <italic>Danish-Norwegian-English Telegraph Co</italic> (1868), <italic>Danish-Russian Telegraph Co</italic> (1868), <italic>Great Northern Telegraph Co</italic> (1869), <italic>China & Japan Extension Telegraph Co</italic> (1870), <italic>EZ Svitzers Salvage Enterprise </italic>(1872), <italic>Danish Sugar Factories</italic> (1872), <italic>Danish Chicory Factories</italic> (1872), and <italic>Copenhagen Construction Co</italic> (1872).\nWhile Tietgen built Danish <italic>Privatbanken</italic> into a German-style universal bank combining retail banking with corporate finance, Swedish<italic> Enskilda</italic> evolved from a note-issuing deposit bank into industrial banks. <italic>E</italic><italic>nskilda </italic>dominated<italic> </italic>Swedish finance. Back in 1668, <italic>Riksbank</italic> replaced Sweden\u2019s first bank, <italic>Palmsturchska Banco</italic>, which was bankrupt since. When the government bailed out trade paper discounting private banks in 1818, Parliament allowed private <italic>enskilda</italic> to issue credit notes in 1824. As <italic>Riksbank</italic> readopted the silver standard in 1830, Sweden granted the first charter to <italic>Sk\u00e5nes Enskilda </italic>in Gothenburg 1831, before <italic>Riksbank</italic> began redeeming notes for silver in 1834. \nTo protect <italic>Riksbank</italic>\u2019s monopoly, the government continued to refuse charters, including one for Warburg cousin Eduard delBanco Henriques Magnez until 1846, when he co-founded <italic>Gothenburg Enskilda</italic>. As Sweden allowed <italic>Riksbank</italic> branches, Andre Wallenberg\u2019s <italic>Stockholm Enskilda </italic>gained permission to compete with <italic>Riksbank</italic> in Stockholm by 1856, but without branching rights. After noteholders ran from <italic>Sk\u00e5nes </italic>in the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>,<italic> </italic>the Crown bailed her out,fueling innovation.\nIn 1864, Karl Benedicks\u2014a cousin of the Halle, Seligmann, and Mendelssohn families, whose brother managed the iron works of Gysinge\u2014merged <italic>Benedicks</italic> to co-found <italic>Skandinaviska Kredit</italic>, Sweden\u2019s first non-note-issuing private deposit bank. <italic>Skandinaviska </italic>funded trade under the leadership of Theodor Mannheim. A nephew of Vienna\u2019s unofficial rabbi and in-law of the Melchiors\u2014related to the Goldschmidt, Warburg, Rapha\u00ebl, and Ballin families\u2014Mannheim had been a <italic>Sk\u00e5nes</italic> commissioner. \nSoon after,<italic> </italic>domestic-focused deposit banks spread. Starting in Stockholm<italic> </italic>in 1871,<italic> Svenska Handel</italic> branched to J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden\u2019s match hub. After the Crown bailed out <italic>Stockholm Enskilda</italic> as depositors ran, <italic>Riksbank</italic> received a note issuance monopoly with increased Crown influence by 1878.\nMeanwhile, <italic>Lubbock</italic>\u2014connected to <italic>Smyth</italic> and <italic>Vivian</italic>\u2014and <italic>Robarts</italic>\u2014connected with Quakers and <italic>Thellusson</italic>\u2014fused in 1860. While <italic>Currie</italic> entered negotiations with <italic>Robarts Lubbock</italic> in 1864, talks stalled, leading <italic>Currie</italic> to fuse into <italic>Glyn</italic>. While <italic>Currie</italic> partners descended from Mary Raike, the Raikes had engaged in <italic>Russia Co</italic> and kinterlinked with John Cayley in the 1750s. After Georgiana Lascelles, a descendant of Cayley\u2019s second great aunt, married Charles Grenfell in 1852, her cousin Louisa Lascelles married Charles Mills of <italic>Glyn </italic>in 1853. \nDuring the blockade of the South during the American <italic>Civil War</italic>, European cotton, flax, and linen markets boomed, including in Ireland. As empires industrialized domestically, America\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic> spurred imperialistic banking to develop coal and cotton industries in India, China, Egypt, and other emerging markets. Among the most active player was <italic>Glyn</italic>, promoting <italic>Bank of Australasia</italic>, <italic>Ottoman</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>, <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>, <italic>London & Brazilian Bank</italic>, and others.\nAfter <italic>British</italic><italic> Companies Act</italic><italic> of </italic><italic>1862</italic>, Samuel Laing\u2014who served as private secretary for Henry Baring Labouchere and then cooperated in investments with <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2014and Philip Rose\u2014 Benjamin Disraeli\u2019s legal and financial agent\u2014helped form and manage <italic>General Credit & Finance Co</italic>, a cr\u00e9dit mobilier to act as an investment principal, like <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>in France, in 1863. Building on this experience, in 1868 they founded <italic>Foreign </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Colonial Government Trust</italic>, with <italic>Glyn</italic> as banker and trustees including <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s George Currie and Eustace Cecil, son of Marquis of Salisbury, cousin-once-removed-in-law of Smyth, and cousin-in-law of the Duncombes and <italic>Beckett</italic>. Soon after, more trusts emerged to invest in securities.\nTo address foreign loan defaults, Isidor Gerstenberg proposed in 1868 what became <italic>Council of Foreign Bondholders</italic> to protect British investors, eventually settling over \u00a31 billion in debts and inspired similar bodies in other countries. Like Born in Breslau, to lottery ticket seller, Isidor moved to Manchester in 1841 where he clerked for Abraham Bauer of Hamburg, whose daughter he married in 1860. Another of Bauer\u2019s clerks was Elias Franklin. Franklin\u2014an Oppenheim cousin and fifth great-grandson of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe, whose Frankel ancestors migrated to Britain with their Adler cousins from Breslau\u2014married a <italic>Samuel Montagu</italic> heiress in 1856. \nAiming to be an international organization, <italic>Council of Foreign Bondholders</italic> proposed <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 Lionel Rothschild as Chair, but this was changed to avoid conflicts of interest due to the Rothschilds\u2019 involvement in foreign loans. The first Chair became John Lubbock of <italic>Robarts Lubbock</italic>.  \nIn Britain, the finance and trade continued to engage in oligarchical politics. After two stints as <italic>Exchequer</italic> Chancellor from 1852 through 1866, Ewart Gladstone started his first term as PM in 1868, all non-consecutive. After his<italic> Exchequer</italic> Chancellor resigned in 1873, Gladstone served at both posts until 1874. When he served as PM again from 1880 to 1885 and 1892 to 1894, he was<italic> Exchequer</italic> Chancellor for the first two years. When Ewart\u2019s cousin Samuel Gladstone became <italic>Gladstone Gillanders Ogilvy</italic> partner and BOE director from 1881, serving as BOE Governor from 1899 to 1901.\n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>South & </italic><italic>East European Panics of Industrialization</italic>\nIn the decade of chaos following 1648, Russian Orthodox reforms meant to shift practices in line with Greek Orthodox created a schism as parishioners rebelled to become Old Believers. While they were endogamous, their religion did not bar them from social acceptance. Geography played a role as the Old Believer communities formed around burial grounds outside of Moscow and later became the city\u2019s main industrial districts. Family ties and networking were integral to Old Believer entrepreneurship, allowing for trust and access to interest-free or low-interest credit within the community. The Old Believers\u2019 control over various industries and their pioneering of technological innovations contributed to the longevity.\nTwo Old Believers were Andrei Simonov and Savva Morozov. Shortly after Simonov joined Moscow\u2019s Merchant Third Guild in 1795, the peasant Morozov family received permission from his lord to set up a ribbon business in 1797. Enserfed in Orekhovo-Zuev, Savva left the village for weekends to vend while his wife and sons manufactured the ribbons. Russia cartelized Ural iron as Napoleon invaded in 1806. However, Napoleon did not have enough coal to warm his army in Russia. By 1807, Napoleon and Russia signed the <italic>Treaty of Tilsit</italic>, allowing Russia to seize Persian Azerbaijan and Turkish Bessarabia by 1813. \nFrance\u2019s <italic>Revolution of 1830</italic> also spread to Russian Poland, particularly to Polish Jews. Following his father\u2014a Court Jew of the Neswisch Radziwills\u2014Leizer Dillon supported the Russian Crown in Poland through the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>. However, Dillon faced investigation for fraud and false accusations from 1820, possibly because he offended Tsar Alex I by refusing to give him his daughter. \nWithin a year, fellow Polish magnate Berek Zbytkower sought permission to buy land from Lord Kicki, but the regime hesitated. His credit operations gained protection from Senator Nowosilcow. When Polish Minister Lubecki canceled Zbytkower\u2019s salt lease in 1821, in the ensuing bidding war over the salt transport monopoly, Nowosilcow arrested Zbytkower\u2019s rival (and brother-in-law) Samuel Frankel on charges of bankruptcy, but released him soon after. \nAs another army contractor failed to obtain civil rights for his family and the right to purchase land, Beinish Lapkovsky of Belarussian Witebsk fled the country, and Berek Zbytkower died. While Berek\u2019s widow Temerel took over the estate, Samuel Frankel baptized in 1806 and become a landowner. Since Samuel Epstein\u2014Luria descendant and son of Rabbi of K\u00f6nigsberg\u2014served with Dillon and Zbytkower, his sixth cousin and the father-in-law of the Chief Rabbi of Wilna, Simeon Epstein, linked Russian Poland with roads. But the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> also created new wealth. With an unknown connection to Samuel and Simeon, candle trader Jacob Epshteyn became a military supplier by 1812. \nSo, <italic>Frankel</italic> and other Jewish entrepreneurs moved from army supplying to banking. Within three years, <italic>Frankel</italic> became <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Warsaw agent. As Jews were given permission to live in Bialystok on the Polish-Belarus border, Orla\u2019s economy declined. In Bialystok, Jewish merchants thrived despite oppression, sometimes by smuggling lumber of the Bialowie\u017ca Forest. As Bialystok\u2019s growing wood exports enriched Katz-in-law Isaac Zabludowsky, his sister wed a Halpern, who founded a bank in Kaunas to foster trade. \nBy 1818, Epshteyn\u2019s son married Zbytkower\u2019s Oesterreicher cousin by 1818. While Samuel Zbytkower\u2019s widow Judyta ran <italic>Zbytkower</italic> until 1825, she transferred the firm to bankers Leon Hirschendorf and Alex Rawicz, forming <italic>Hirschendorf Rawicz</italic>. Back in 1821, trader Majer Zbytkower Flatau married Karolina Bernstein, from a family of cloth manufacturers and merchants. \nKarolina\u2019s sister married Leon Hirschendorff in 1823, and another wed married Jakob Flatau in 1826. After Oesterreicher cousin Alex Rawicz married Marja Gutmann in 1828, her banker brother wed merchant\u2019s daughter Josephine Rosen in 1834. Josephine sisters has wed Leo Toeplitz\u2014whose merchant brother married an Oesterreicher cousin of the Zbytkower and Flatau families\u2014in 1821 and Karolina Bernstein\u2019s brother in 1832. Hirschendorf and Rawicz converted by 1831.\nJudyta\u2019s step daughter-in-law, Temerel, remained in business. Earlier, Temerel\u2019s  Horowitz cousin married the granddaughter of deceased Prince Potemkin\u2019s Court Advisor Joshua Zeitlin. After the death of her husband Berek, Temerel ran his businesses. She gained permission to buy real estate denied to Berek, and won a legal dispute over the salt monopoly lease. In 1827, she acquired an estate with the Tsar\u2019s approval, though managed by Christians. As she founded a bank in the 1830s, Temerel continued banking and leading Hasidism. By 1828, she grew alliances, marrying her step-granddaughter to a Landau, of a likely but unknown relation to that family. \nHowever, the Landau rabbinate faced competition, particularly in Krakau. While Berek\u2019s son Leo married a daughter of Rabbi Hertzfeld of K\u00f6nigsberg and Rawitch, her brother married a sister of Ber Meisel, a descendant of Court Jew Meisel and Katz. Ber Meisel wed a daughter of Zelman Bornstein and a wealthy heiress of Liczki. Another of Bornstein\u2019s daughters married Isaac Horowitz Halberstam of Brody private bank <italic>Halberstam Nirenstein</italic> in 1814. \nAs Bornstein managed Krakau salt mines with the Zbytkowers, Meisel founded Krakau bank <italic>Meisel </italic><italic>Horowitz</italic> with Halberstam and became Rabbi of Krakau in 1832. Though the Zbytkowers, Bornstein married his daughters to the Posners, who founded Jewish agricultural and industrial colonies in Poland. While a daughter of Berek\u2019s sister and Samuel Frankel married Saxon banking heir and grandson of Philippine Kaskele in 1831, Isaac Horowitz Halberstam\u2019s mother married fellow widower Isaac Zabludowsky.\nEarlier, Berek and Temerel secured a match for their daughter and Issachar Horowitz, grandson of the Rabbi of Richwal Samuel Horowitz. The Zbytkower were intimates of Hasidic leaders, providing access to their home and allowing them to gain experience by managing their business enterprises. Simhah Bunem, for example, supervised the floating of lumber to Danzig for Berek. He also clerked with the Siedlce tax farmer and grain dealer in Danzig. A son of the Maggid of Wtodzystaw and a Horowitz mother, Bunem wed Rebbeca, daughter of the wealthy Moses Orverger-Kazov of Bedzin. \nLikely through his training with Zbytkower, Bunem\u2019s daughter married the son of contractor Hirsch Danziger. Danziger\u2019s daughter married Levi Isaac\u2019s son. While Isaac\u2019s forefathers had been Galician rabbis, his mother was a Katz-descendant. Isaac wed Pearl, daughter of a rich Katz-descendant contractor Israel Perez. He went on to found Hasidism in central Poland as he succeeded Samuel Horowitz as Rabbi of Richwal, then Zelechow, and became the Zaddik of Zelechow until 1775, when he served as Rabbi of Pinsk, and Berdichev in 1785 until his death.\nOutside of Congress Poland, along with the <italic>Pale</italic> cities of Grodno, Wilna, Shklov, and Bialystok, Berdichev played a pivotal role in trade. Among the most prominent Berdichev pioneers was Katz-descendant Israel Friedman, Hasidic royalty though his forefather Maggid of Mezhirech, a disciple of Baal Shem-Tov. After marrying a fellow Katz-descendant of Mark Meisel, Habsburg Emperor Rudolf II\u2019s Mint Jew\u2014in 1810, Friedman arrived in Berdichev in 1813 and joined the Second Merchants\u2019 Guild. As his wealth grew, so did his messianic aura and international followers after he became the Rabbi of Ruzhin.\nIn the same period, Abraham Rafalovich married his cousin Olga Lowensohn, of a rabbinical family including child prodigy Isaac Levinsohn. Along with Mark Gunzburg, Levinsohn was considered \u2018Russian Mendelssohn\u2019 and the founder of the Haskalah in Russia. They continued intra-marrying. In 1826, Bella Lowensohn, Olga\u2019s sister, married an Ephrussi, a hereditary merchant from Berdichev. The Ephrussi family went on to establish a trading firm in 1828, fostering ongoing partnerships and marriages between the two families.\nSince moving from Worms to Poland, Katz-cousin and extended cousin of deceased Prince Potemkin\u2019s Court Advisor Natan Nota, Gabriel Gunzburg of Belarussian Witebsk married Leah Rashkes, a descendant of Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and cousin-in-law and extended cousin of Prince Potemkin\u2019s Court Advisor Joshua Zeitlin as well as the Wilna Gaon. With special permission as a tax farmer, Gunzburg traded outside of the <italic>Pale </italic>in Ukrainian Podolia on the Galician border. \nAs his son Joseph married the daughter of Katz and Meisel descendant David Dynin\u2014manager of the postal station in Orsha, the central station between Petersburg, Kiev, Moscow, and Warsaw, whose became  a large Kishinev and Odessa merchant after serving in the tax office of <italic>Gunzburg</italic>\u2014in 1830, Gunzburg set up trade branches. Similarly, their Frankel cousins maintained their roles as bankers and rabbis across Prussian and Russian Poland, marrying into rabbinical families.\nMeanwhile, Russian repression of Jews continued to destabilize commerce. In some sense, there was progress. From 1824, the east Ukrainian region of Poltava allowed wealthy Jews to enter the First Guild, and later vote and live outside of the <italic>Pale</italic>. Only in 1832, however, did Sephardi tax farmer Portugalov enter Poltava\u2019s First Guild. And when Tsar Alex observed a Jewish family outside of the <italic>Pale</italic> engaging in forbidden tin-plate production, he had the family deported, and ordered the local authorities to strictly enforce Jewish regulations. \nFollowing Alex\u2019s death, his brother Nicholas ascended the throne. By 1827, Tsar Nicholas redrafted the wartime cantonist program of 1805. Originally designed to educate the sons of Russian soldiers for future service, Nicholas shifted cantonism to assimilate Jews. All Jewish boys over twelve were dispatched to distant military schools for conversion to Orthodoxy, subject to severe treatment, with 25-years of mandatory military service. As Jews to rose in protest, Nicholas allege exploitation, and expelled Kiew\u2019s 700 Jews, followed by Sevastopol, Nikolaev, and the Baltic region, leading many to flee to Odessa and Kherson. \nAnd without Jews, as plantation debt caused discontent in Congress Poland, Minister Lubecki established <italic>Mortgage</italic><italic> Society</italic>. While benefiting landlords, government mortgages cancelled peasant rights. While Lubecki established <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland </italic>to take control the grain trade from Jewish factors in 1828. However, limited success led Lubecki to borrow from <italic>Frankel</italic> to access <italic>Rothschild</italic> and other Berlin bankers. Outbreak of the <italic>Polish</italic> <italic>Uprising of 1830</italic>, however, prevented use of the funds as Berlin sequestered credits. Within months, <italic>Frankel</italic> kinterlinked with the Kaskele of Dresden.\nJewish pro-Russian sympathies suffered a blow from cantonism. In Warsaw, during the <italic>Uprising of 1830</italic>, assimilated Jewish banking heirs such as Samuel Kronenberg, Jacob Epshteyn, and two Toeplitzes supported their fellow Polish patriots for emancipation from Russia. Born into a rabbinical family in Polish Wyszogrod, Kronenberg adopted his surname and Haskalah ideals and began engaging in trade and banking in Warsaw during the Prussian period. In 1808, he adopted European-style clothing, cut his beard, and founded <italic>Kronenberg</italic> bank. After Samuel died in 1826, his widow managed the family finances and business. \nAs Warsaw-born Radziwill cousin Leon Sapieha and hundreds of Polish nobles revolted in 1830, Sapieha fled to Austrian Galicia and Russia turned to Jews from outside of Warsaw. Although aiding both sides, Russia stopped investigating Leizer Dillon after a decade as he aided Russian troops. Within months, Luria descendant Simeon Epstein moved to Warsaw after building roads. \nBy 1835, <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland </italic>borrowed from <italic>Frankel </italic>and a son of military supplier Jacob Epshteyn. Epshteyn\u2019s other son, Herman, soon became Imperial Tax Collector, and hired many of the laid off Polish nobles. <italic>Frankel</italic><italic> </italic>kinterlinked <italic>Magnus</italic> of Berlin, who used the Polish bonds as collateral to borrow from <italic>Schickler</italic>. Away from Warsaw during the <italic>Uprising</italic> training with <italic>Heine</italic> in Hamburg, Samuel Kronenberg\u2019s son Leo operated <italic>Kronenberg</italic> with his mother from 1832, and became the Administrator of the tobacco monopoly by 1839.\nWhile the state-controlled mining, <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland </italic>received permission to lease the Dabrowa iron works. Since a tariff from 1831 hurt wool manufacturing after transit to China stopped, wool factories moved to Bialystok due to lost army demand and limited Russian market access, forcing <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland </italic>to take over ownership in 1833. Bialystok became a key cloth producer. Cotton mills boosted production, competing locally against Russian imports. After Isaac Zabludowsky\u2019s daughter Malka married Katz-descendant, Isaac and his son-in-law founded Bialystok\u2019s first factory in 1842. Following Alex\u2019s death in 1848, Malka led the firm until her death in 1878. While one of her children wed a Zabludowsky, two others married Halperns.\nRussia sought to prevent the revolutionary spirt from spreading across former Polish lands. The influences of Polish nobles continued in Russian Ukraine as a single absentee Catholic bishop in western Ukraine possessed 6,200 serfs and over 100 thousand acres of land just in Kiew Province, accusing the Poles of dehumanizing the peasantry, treating them like slaves. Consequently, the 1830 insurrection and the portrayal of the Poles and Jews as exploiters facilitated Nicholas I\u2019s implementation of Russification measures in administration, finance, and language. \nDuring the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, Sweden ceded Finland to Russia, which became the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland under the tsars, who preserved Finland\u2019s laws, Lutheran faith, and granted <italic>Bank of Finland</italic>. In practice, Finnish autonomy was shaped by personal ties through families such as the Stjernvall and the Russian elite. After the peace, Carl Stjernvall and his brother became governors of the provinces of Viipuri and of Uusimaa and H\u00e4me. \nLikewise, Carl\u2019s wife\u2014whose deceased father had owned one of the largest estates in Finland,  had extensive business interests and was a governor\u2014was a sister-in-law of the governor of Turku. While Carl and his brother died in 1815, his widow married Carl\u2019s successor. Their daughters cemented alliances with Russia. While one wed dominant miner Paul Demidov\u2014a client of <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2014in 1836, her sister married into the political Pushkin family. Likewise, their cousins held positions with <italic>Bank of Finland</italic>.\nWhile Russia expanded de facto recognition of Lutherans by then, she continued to impose limitations on Jews and Old Believers. Before Saint-Petersburg banned Jewish books in 1837, Russian cotton-spinning transformed as three large factories were built in Saint-Petersburg, the largest of which belonged to Ludwig Stiglitz. In Moscow, Andrei Simonov\u2019s grandson Fedor kinterlinked with a fellow Old Believer textile manufacturing family and acquired two mills in 1829. By 1837, Morozov established a textile manufactory, soon adopting American cotton as the primary material. \nAs Kiew established school to accelerate the shift from Polish to Russian, the Tsar closed the Polish bank in Berdychiv, and Russia excluded Kiew from the <italic>Pale</italic> in 1836. So, Jews were allowed to live in the province, but only visit the city for fairs. By 1840, <italic>Commercial Bank of </italic><italic>Kiew</italic>, a Russian counterpart modeled on <italic>Commercial Bank of Odessa</italic>, emerged. Furthermore, tax incentives attracted Russian merchants, with one of them being chosen as Kiew\u2019s mayor.\nAs a result of the expulsion of Jews from Kiew, Berdichev boomed. Soon, Rabbi Friedman faced suspicion over his messianic aspirations and was imprisoned in Kiew for 22 months from 1838 on false charges related to the deaths of Jewish informers. Although the charges were eventually dropped, police surveillance continued. After Friedman\u2019s daughter married Berdichev banker Jacob Halpern\u2019s son, Halpern leading of a planned operation against Friedman was operating in Kiew, warning Friedman. As Friedman fled to Moldova with support of Jassy Banker Michael Daniel and then to nearby Galician Bukovina in Austria, where intervention by Rothschild and others led Austria to protect Friedman from extradition to Russia.\nSince the 1820s, Austrian Brody merchants <italic>Bernstein</italic>, <italic>Halberstam</italic>, <italic>Nathansohn</italic>, together with <italic>Herzenstein</italic> and other Russian Ukrainian Jews, conducted transit trade. In 1825 the export house of <italic>Gurovich</italic> opened, followed in 1830 by <italic>Ephrussi</italic>, <italic>Gurovich</italic>, <italic>Trachtenberg</italic>, and other major banks and trading firms such as moved from Berdichev to Odessa. A year after Abraham Rafalovich and his eldest son Fedor founded <italic>Rafalovich</italic> in 1837, a Gunzburg married Kiew guild merchant Hessel Rosenberg, a descendant of Katz and Rabbi of Krakau Joel Sirkes. In 1836 Jewish merchants operated 71 shops in Odessa, and by 1840 the number reached 80. \nSince <italic>Rafalovich</italic> cousins Pernas moved to Tarnopol, leasing estates by the end of the 18th century, they kinterlinked with the Byk family in the 1830s, involved in grain export and estate leasing, The Byks had long traded in Brody and kinterlinked with Rappaports descended from Zevi Ashkenasy, whose descendants served as rabbis of Letichev in Russo-Ukrainian Podolia. While his cousin once removed married the daughter of Warsaw banker Isaac Zabludowsky in Bialystok, Alex Byk became a banker in Moldova and his sister married a Halpern.\nAfter Ludwig liquidated <italic>Stiglitz</italic> in Odessa after the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>, <italic>Mahs</italic> took his banking business. As Stiglitz and Mahs continued to dominate London flax, Ernest Mahs became a <italic>Stiglitz</italic> partner to trade with <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>. Of the first Stiglitz<italic> </italic>generation born in Russia, Alex Stiglitz studied at a university before joining <italic>Imperial Commercial Bank</italic>. Raising foreign loans since 1841, Alex several built <italic>Saint-Petersburg-Moscow</italic> RR from 1843 with <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Hope</italic>. Starting in 1846, Alex chaired the <italic>Saint-Petersburg Stock Exchange Committee</italic> for a decade. \nAs chair of the <italic>Saint-Petersburg Stock Exchange Committee</italic>, Stiglitz wielded significant influence over commercial transactions, particularly international dealings crucial to the empire\u2019s financial stability. <italic>Stieglitz</italic> played a central role in facilitating connections with key financial hubs like Amsterdam, London, and Paris. In 1846, when <italic>Garman</italic> of London faced bankruptcy, Stieglitz proactively alerted the Russian Finance Minister, and acted with his London agent, the Huguenot <italic>Mollet</italic>,<italic> </italic>to protect Russian interests. \nThe Napoleonic Wars also transformed the Balkans and the Italian Peninsula. While the vast Turkish empire mostly relied on burning wood for fuel as the military\u2019s control over Heraclea and other coal mines limited access, Under Ottoman Turkish rule, the Balkans were characterized by a predominantly agrarian economy, with limited financial infrastructure. \nDespite the presence of significant mineral resources, including coal and various metals, exploitation and industrial development were minimal due to the constraints of the Ottoman rule. The lack of developed infrastructure, markets, and industrial labor skills limited the region\u2019s attractiveness to private investors. While few bankers and financiers were present in the area, Jewish money exchangers played a key role in financial transactions using different currencies.\nSince Habsburg Austria and Ottoman Turkey established free trade in 1718, allowing Sina and other Turkish Greek and Armenian traders outside of guilds to engage in caravan commerce and corruption across the Balkans, Imperial acts in 1719 and 1725 opened the Austrian Free Port of Trieste to all. \nDuring the Austrian occupation of Serbia from 1718 to 1739, Jews in Belgrade faced strict Catholic Church and Austrian-imposed restrictions: limited residency rights, mandatory taxes, and a ban on synagogue construction. Court Jew Joseph Oppenheim helped ease these briefly, enabling Jews to trade wheat and beer until legal disputes halted their activities. After Austria\u2019s 1739 retreat, Jews endured renewed repression under Ottoman rule. Peace allowed trade with Austria, drawing Sephardim to Belgrade and Zemun, as Ashkenazim moved to Austria. Austrian reoccupation from 1788 to 1791 sparked fresh displacements.\nBy the late 18th century, Serbian households in Sumadija owned substantial livestock. Between 1777 and 1786, Hungary imported 1.3 million <italic>francs</italic> of pigs from the Ottoman Empire, primarily from Serbia. The Austro-Turkish commercial agreement of 1784 and the peace treaty of 1791 granted Serbs in the Pashalik of Belgrade unrestricted trade rights, including livestock, particularly to Austria and her armies during the French Revolutionary Wars. By 1800, Serbia annually exported livestock valued at 3 million <italic>francs</italic> to Austria.\nThe First Serbian Revolt began in 1802. With weaker central authority and stronger foreign influences, making it distinct from other Turkish provinces. Inspired by Enlightenment ideas, the predominantly Greek Orthodox Serbian elite revolted with support from Serbs in Austrian Hungary. While Napoleon supported Serbia to destabilize Turkey and expand French influence, Russia sought to establish a Slavic state. Despite international interests and alliances, Turkey crushed the Serbian revolution in 1813, ending this struggle for independence. From 1815, Serbia was an Ottoman vassal territory under Serbian Pasha Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107. \nAs Pasha Obrenovi\u0107 welcome Jews, David Haim \u201cDavico\u201d became his Court Jew. During the Serbian Uprising of 1802, some of Belgrade\u2019s Haim family fled to Vienna. While Leon Haim led the Habsburg branch and presided over the Vienna\u2019s Sephardic community, the Belgrade branch remained Ottoman subjects. So, David Haim extended credit and luxury goods from Vienna and supplied the Serbian army.\nSince Russia occupied the Turkish Principalities of Wallachia and Moldova, including the capitals of Bucharest and Jassy by 1806, she annexed northwest-most Bessarabia. Jews faced intensified persecution from both Russian forces and the local Romanian population. While the future architect of Tsar Nicholas I\u2019s Jewish policy, Russian Commander of Wallachia and Moldova Count Pavel Kiselev, implemented anti-Jewish legislation in 1831, The Ottoman Sultan appointed Greek merchant princes Ghica and their in-laws Sturza ruled Turkish Wallachia and Moldova in 1834. As the Principalities opened to foreign trade, and Jewish traders, artisans, bankers, and contractors expanded domestic and international markets. \nAmong many Greek merchants and nobles, Bucharest\u2019s earliest modern Jewish banker was Joseph Halfon\u2014of unknown roots\u2014started <italic>Halfon</italic> in 1830 and wed Eliezer Manoach\u2019s daughter Rachel in 1836. After starting <italic>Elias</italic> in 1837 with his brother, Menachem Elias married Rachel\u2019s sister by 1839. From Kolomea in East Galicia, Jacob Marmorosch married the daughter of Bucharest merchant <italic>L\u00f6bel</italic>\u2014and rabbi\u2019s granddaughter\u2014and started what became <italic>Marmorosch </italic>with his brother-in-law Isaak L\u00f6bel. But as Jewish traders, artisans, and bankers shaped Moldova and Wallachia, antisemitism grew. \nDuring the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, Jewish moneylenders grew in Moldova, generally subjects of Austria from Galicia, Russia from Bessarabia, or France from Poland. The most prominent was Michael Daniel, who arrived in Moldova from Galicia by 1804 and obtained an Austrian patent renewed in 1823. Marrying locally in Jassy, he opened a money-changing business. By 1819, he had established financial ties with <italic>S\u00fcsskind</italic> in Augsburg, <italic>Burnstein</italic> in Danzig, <italic>Mendelsohn</italic> (of unknown relation to Katz <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> of Berlin) and <italic>Demonte</italic> <italic>Guzan</italic> in Verona, and <italic>Ortta</italic> and <italic>Curiel</italic> in Venice. After 1829, he expanded dealings to <italic>Adamachi</italic> in Constantinople, <italic>Rothschild</italic> in Frankfurt, Paris, and London, <italic>Stametz</italic> in Vienna, <italic>Bernard</italic> in Berlin, and <italic>Meyer</italic> in Dresden and Leipzig. Moreover, Daniel supported Rabbi Israel Friedman from Russia and the rise of Hasidism.\nHe conducted note trading, currency exchange, and payments, and issued loans to individuals, the Moldovan Treasury, and sponsored Moldovan Prince Mihail Sturdza accession to the throne. While his cousin-in-laws ruled Wallachia, Prince Sturza\u2019s reign of Moldova started in 1834. Amidst surging antisemitism, a commission expelled most of Jassy\u2019s Jews in 1835. Along with leading led Jews in paying off Sturdza\u2019s debts in exchange for revoking the expulsion order, Daniel intervened to pardon five Jewish youths condemned to death. In 1839, false accusations led to the killing of a Jew and imprisonment of twelve others, sentenced to hang, until Jewish bankers forgave royal and public debts for their release. \nLikewise, Mahmud Bey, Kavanos Oglu, a member of a prominent Wallachian family honored by the Ottoman Sultan, extended their influence on Bulgaria. While Mahmud engaged Armenian banker Arabetian, Pasha Usref of Belgrade\u2019s fortress employed the Jewish Yeuda brothers. Yeuda traded with Sephardi hereditary jeweler Kuyumdji from the iron forges of Plovdiv on the Maritsa River in southern Bulgaria through Samokov near Sofia, up to Vidin on the border, and along the Danube River through Wallachia and Serbia into to Pest in Hungary. Yeuda and Kuyumdji also competed with the coreligionists. Emperor Joseph II had expelled the Sephardi Ari\u00e9 family from Vienna in 1775, reportedly due to a scandal involving their handsome son and the Empress. They relocated to Vidin, and thrived in metallurgy, banking, real estate, and textiles, helping build Samokov\u2019s synagogue.\nInstead of Jews, Salonica descended <italic>Zaharoff</italic> of Bucharest and Izmir banked the Russian embassy in Constantinople in 1838. He founded a successful import-export business, dealing primarily in metallurgical products from <italic>Demidov</italic>, like <italic>Rothschild</italic>. In 1838, Despite setbacks, such as the bankruptcy of his Bucharest associate, Stephane Hadji Moso, he married into Greek nobility and his firm gained prominence.\nIn Serbia, David Haim began printing activity in 1837 shortly after the Serbian state printing-press started. The downfall of Pasha Obrenovi\u0107 in 1839 led to restrictions Jewish real estate ownership and commerce in Belgrade. The Haim still managed to maintain commercial prosperity and exchange business.\nSince Catholic Italy remained fragmented, Christian aristocrats mostly married locally while Jews linked trade by kinterlinking across borders within Italy and outside. In French-occupied Naples, the implementation of the <italic>Napoleonic Code</italic> in 1806 ended feudalism and fragmentated estates. Additionally, the acquisition of Ferrara from the Papal States resulted in the rise of a new middle class. However, these changes were not without challenges. Growing competition and tensions reached a breaking point during the revolutionary movements of the <italic>Panic of 1830</italic>, which further fueled changes. Despite the upheaval, liberal reforms began to take hold in Naples, while Austria, adhering to the <italic>Holy Alliance</italic> of 1822, to support the existing order.\nAmid this period of turbulence, the Papacy turned to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna for financial assistance, with the latter also financing Austrian military occupation from Ferrara to Bologna. Meanwhile, in Austrian Milan, the Finzi family played a prominent role in the financial and manufacturing sectors. Since the 16th century, Finzi bankers had kinterlinked with the Venetian Pisa. \nAron Finzi, who initially started as a warehouse employee, established his own successful business as a merchant and commission agent in 1806. Notably, his cousin Venturina Finzi married the son of ennobled Ferrarese banker Elia Pisa, whose death in 1836 led widow Venturina to grant power of attorney to her sons, who subsequently founded the Milanese bank <italic>Pisa</italic>. In 1840, the Emperor awarded Aron Finzi with citizenship for his achievements.\nFollowing bankruptcy during the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, the Goldschmidt-in-laws <italic>Landauer </italic>of Vienna refocused on the wholesale silk trade with Trieste. The Free Port of Trieste was a center for the European insurance industry. Since the Morpurgo, Levi, and Luzzatto families incorporated Trieste\u2019s first insurer in the 1760s, more than 20 insurance firms operated there by 1826, including <italic>Azienda</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Assicuratrice</italic>. With mostly Christian directors including Chiot<italic> </italic><italic>Ralli</italic>, Dutch <italic>Dutilh</italic>, and fabrics trader Alessio Paris, <italic>Adriatico Banco</italic> added river transport and credit insurance in 1829.\nAs Ida Morpurgo married Ignacio Bauer\u2014the nephew of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s chief clerk, Moritz Goldschmidt\u2014who joined <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Spanish agent, <italic>Weisweiller</italic>, which had kinterlinked with fellow Frankfurt families Goldschmidt and Speyer as well as the Brillin Oppenheim Landauers, <italic>Generali</italic> started in Trieste in 1831 with capital from Giuseppe Morpurgo, Marco Parente, Vidal Cusin, Samuel Vida, <italic>Bas</italic><italic>s</italic><italic>evi</italic>, <italic>Luzzatto</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna and the Christian Giambattista Rosmini, Alessio Paris, and Giovanni Cristoforo. \nAfter other Trieste insurers formed a consortium that year, it transformed into <italic>Lloyd</italic> Austria by 1833 with directors including <italic>Azienda</italic>\u2019s Carl Bruck, Pasquale Revoltella, Elio Morpurgo, Marco Parente, <italic>Bas</italic><italic>s</italic><italic>evi</italic>, <italic>Luzzatto</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna.  After coal exploration begun in Istria and Dalmatia in 1829, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna invested in the venture. In 1834, <italic>Viennese Dalmatiam Coal Works</italic> opened in Drnis, without a railway to transport coal to the sea.\nSince Rabbi of Prague Ezekiel Landau\u2019s daughter married a son of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s second great-granddaughter and the wealthy Meir Pressburger of Vienna, Pressburger\u2019s great-nephew Michael Biedermann rose from an apprentice engraver to a  banker. His children married Frankfurt banker Benedict Goldschmidt\u2019s Kann brother-in-law in 1827, Samson Wertheim\u2019s descendant of Vienna in 1833, and a Kaulla in 1840. Likewise, Biedermann\u2019s brother married a Preisach, connected to the Mandl and Arnstein families.\nHaving moved to Russian Odessa in 1822 from Austrian Brody to represent his father-in-law and grandfather, Osias Nathansohn, Leon Landau\u2014a Katz Wulff descendant and great-grandson of Chief Rabbi of Galicia Bernstein, and Ezekiel Landau\u2019s extended cousin from Krakau\u2014exported grain. In 1835, L\u00e9on and Nathansohn collaborated with Viennese wholesaler <italic>Biedermann Wertheim</italic> to branch to Galatz in Moldova. Managing <italic>Biedermann </italic>Pest by 1837, L\u00e9on later founded his own bank there. Leon\u2019s son, Horace Landau, apprenticed in Trieste at <italic>Morpurgo</italic>, eventually becoming a director and laying the foundation for his career as a <italic>Rothschild</italic> representative.  \nBy 1832, Morpurgo kinterlinked with shipowners Vivante of Venice kinterlinked with the Treves family and Todros bankers of Turin. Since the days of the Jewish princes of Narbonne, the Treves had financed a treaty with the Barbary pirates\u2014for which Napoleon ennobled them\u2014and launched Venice\u2019s first food shipping venture with the Americas. Also with Narbonne roots, Davidic descendant Todros kinterlinked with <italic>Samuel Phillips</italic>.\nUniting shareholders of Trieste\u2019s other insurers in 1832, Carlo Bruck proposed reforms leading to the creation of <italic>Austrian Lloyd</italic>, modeled after <italic>Lloyd</italic> Insurer of London. Marco Parente and other <italic>Austrian Lloyd</italic> investors joined <italic>Generali</italic>\u2019s management committee in 1835, contributing to the city\u2019s economic growth through real estate investments and involvement in infrastructure projects. Within months, Morpurgo and Parente<italic> </italic>kinterlinked. When <italic>Austrian Lloyd</italic> and Trieste insurers faced a crisis during the <italic>Panic of 1839</italic>, Carlo Bruck secured a loan from <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna.\nEven after forming <italic>Rothschild</italic> Naples in 1844, the family did not operate in Piedmont, and relied on agents, particularly<italic> Parodi</italic>, <italic>Leonino</italic>,<italic> </italic>and<italic> Avigdor</italic>. As some of the Kohanim Sacerdote \u201cLeonino\u201d of Tuscany moved to London, Ippolito Leonino married Hannah Montefiore Cohen-Barent in 1841, and his nephew Sabino formed <italic>Leonino</italic> London. Claiming Sacerdote descent like their Leonino neighbors in Casale, the Vitta family became prominent landowners in Piedmont despite legal restrictions. While Giuseppe Vitta\u2019s daughter married the son of Allegra Morpurgo and Giuseppe Uzielli, of a long-established Livorno banking family, in 1831, Vitta\u2019s son had moved to Lyon and opened a bank by the 1840s.\nSettling in Nice in the early 17th century, the Avigdor family continued their traditional banking until brothers Moise and Abramo Avigdor founded a bank in 1768. Despite initial failure, Moise built <italic>Avigdor</italic> into a grand merchant bank, with his son serving as a representative at Napoleon\u2019s Grand Sanhedrin. Kinterlinking with Worms in 1834, <italic>Avigdor</italic> became <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s Nice agent in 1835 and Paris in 1838, two Avigdor brothers married Goldsmid cousins. Their commercial acumen extended to ventures such as trade in Apulian olive oil, with Felice Garibaldi, brother of Giuseppe Garibaldi, acting as their agent in Bari. \nIn Genoa, brothers Giacomo and Francesco Parodi founded a bank around 1785. From the 1830s, <italic>Parodi</italic> became an agent of <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, intermediating loans for the Pope. In 1843, <italic>Parodi</italic> co-founded Sardinia\u2019s first issuing bank, <italic>Bank of Genoa</italic>. Around a quarter of funds came from the Genoese nobility, with Raffaele Ferrari becoming the first President with support from his brother-in-law Ludovico d\u2019Eril, a descendant of Cosimo Medici. A banker who worked with <italic>Odier</italic>, <italic>P\u00e9rier</italic>, and <italic>Lafitte</italic>, Raffaele\u2019s father was the son of the Doge of Genoa and a Spinola. In 1828, Raffaele married a daughter of Brignole Sale, Mayor of Genoa and diplomat under Emperor Napoleon. In 1836, he co-founded <italic>Genoa-Turin-Lombardy</italic> RR and served as President until 1845, when the Piedmont government rejected his railway plans, assuming control of <italic>Genoa-Turin</italic> RR without extending her to Lombardy.\nThe families worked closely with banking Jews in other Italian centers. In 1811, the Mondolfi and Fermi families were among the four Jewish bankers handling foreign exchange in Florence and, by 1829, they co-founded <italic>Discount Bank of Florence</italic> with Daivd Franchetti. The Franchetti, having traded Tunisian woolen hats in the Ottoman Empire in the 18th century, diversified into grain and arms, building a network that included Livorno. Closing his Livorno business in 1836, David Franchetti relocated to Florence. \nAs David\u2019s daughter married a Mondolfi, the families partnered to secure the Tuscan Tobacco Monopoly and co-found <italic>Bank of Livorno</italic>. By 1839, Franchetti\u2019s son wed C\u00e9lestine Sciama Marini of Marseilles after his first cousin once removed married C\u00e9lestine\u2019s cousin Anne Sciama in 1833. Descended from the Chief Rabbi of Aleppo Sciama, the family kinterlinked with the Duponts, Ratisbonnes\u2014relatives of Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, Samson Wertheim, Cerf Berr, <italic>Boas</italic>\u2014, and Foas, who were connected to Hippolyte Gradis Rodrigues. \nMeanwhile, Polish banks were weakest in the Prussian partition as banks were based on registration instead of concessions. So discoveries drove banking there. From Hohensalza in Posen, Michael Levi, a descendant of Katz-cousin Salomon Luria, discovered rock salt deposits, constructed <italic>Thorn-</italic> <italic>Hohensalza</italic><italic>-Posen</italic> RR in the 1830s, fostering regional industrialization. He may have been related to Lesser Levi, who founded a bank in Warsaw in 1838, specializing in loans and the sale of grain and wood to Danzig. \n<italic>Heimann</italic> was Prussian Silesia\u2019s most prominent Jewish private bank. In 1819, Ernest Heimann founded a money-changing business<italic> </italic>in Breslau, supported by his savings and family assistance. He married Johanna Friedl\u00e4nd, the daughter of a leaseholder and merchant in 1821. By 1834, he initiated <italic>Breslau Stock Exchange</italic>, and in 1836, participated in the first meeting for the construction of <italic>Upper Silesian</italic> RR. From 1844 until his death in 1867, he served on the railway\u2019s board of directors and, in 1848, co-founded <italic>Silesian Fire Insurance Co</italic>, acting as a share promoter and director. He also worked with <italic>Municipal Bank of Breslau</italic> and <italic>Breslau Loan Bank</italic> while introducing shares like <italic>Austrian</italic><italic> </italic>RR on <italic>Breslau Stock Exchange</italic>.\nOutside of banking, Jews played a significant role in the development of Silesian heavy industry, dating back to the 17th century when Jews from the Beuthen estate of the Henckel Counts worked in ore and calamine mines. Post-emancipation in the 19th century, Count Henckel Donnersmarck established <italic>Bethlen-Falva Ironworks</italic> and <italic>Laurah\u00fctte</italic>. With the lifting of mining restrictions after 1821, private individuals Jews founded industrial enterprises. While Simon Levy and David L\u00f6wenfeid of Breslau co-founded coke blast furnace works <italic>Friedensh\u00fctte</italic> in 1840, Moritz Friedl\u00e4nder, son of a leather factory owner, co-founded smelting works <italic>Minerva</italic>. The Kerns established the Herminen smelting works. Like the Pringsheims, the Huldschinskys were instrumental in the development of Upper Silesia\u2019s mining and industrial sectors.\nSince Habsburg Emperor Charles VI and his daughter Empress Maria-Theresa promoted Austrian nobles to invest in industry, Bohemia industrialized with the Emperor and aristocrats were active in cotton. Indeed, Emperor Charles VI  promoted Austrian nobles to engage in industry, himself investing in a venture managing the Linz woolen fabrics and the Schwechat cotton factories. By the 1820s, <italic>Czech Industrial Society</italic> leaders advocated for savings banks to support industry among the agricultural population. The first savings bank in Prague was founded in 1825. While several insurance societies were also established, Prague lacked major banks for decades.\nBut merchant bankers began gaining control of assets. Johann Berger began selling linen goods in 1772 and expanded to wholesale by 1775, partnering with Prague banker Karl Balabene. In 1793, he acquired and modernized a bleachery near Liberec, adding a dyeing shop. His cloth factory, established in 1798, was managed by Ferdinand R\u00f6mheld, who invested in Dutch and British equipment for the following years. \nAfter Berger\u2019s death, R\u00f6mheld managed Count Wallenstein\u2019s cloth factory in Horn\u00ed Litv\u00ednov, installing a steam engine in 1826. While Count Christian Clam-Gallas built a dye-works near Liberec in 1806, he sold it to <italic>Ballabene</italic> within two years. <italic>Ballabene</italic> turned the works into a wool and cotton spinning mill which he sold to Bohemian industrialist Johann Liebieg. After opening a textile shop in Liberec in 1818, Liebieg acquired a spinning mill in Josephinenthal and expanded with steam-powered factories by 1827.\nLikewise, Jews entered industry. The Porges-Spiro brothers, Leo and Moses, began as a linen merchant and a brandy dealer in the Prague ghetto. In 1808, they opened a small cotton printing shop near the Jewish quarter, expanding to a factory in Sm\u00edchov by 1815. By the 1840s, they employed about 4,000 workers in cotton spinning and weaving. After a visit by Emperor Ferdinand I in 1841, they were ennobled. Moses married the sister of a brother-in-law of Prague-born Moritz Porges. A great-nephew of Katz-descendant of Chief Rabbi of Moravia Gabriel Eskeles and a cousin-in-law of <italic>L\u00e4mel</italic>, Moritz moved to Vienna by 1822 and became a jeweler.  \nWhile Moritz\u2019s daughter and niece wed Sampson Wertheim\u2019s descendants, a third cousin Karoline married the son of a Prague textile manufacturer Israel Epstyn in 1820. Since Epstyn\u2019s nephew married Simon L\u00e4mel\u2019s daughter in 1818, Epstyn\u2019s other son wed a Parente Morpurgo of Trieste in 1852. By 1846, another of Moritz\u2019s daughters wed Moritz Ulman\u2019s son-in-law\u2019s cousin, with whose family Ulman split the Hungarian grain trade. Out of Jungbunzlau, the Bondi and Haurowitz families kinterlinked and built a textile press that later transformed into one of Bohemia\u2019s most significant cotton industry enterprises.\nSimilarly, the Emperor and banker aristocrats owned most Bohemian coal mines, iron works, and other industries. In 1829, the Archbishop of Olm\u00fctz established <italic>Witkowitz</italic> iron works. Private bankers from Vienna financed railways. One group constructed the Linz-Budweiser line using horse-drawn transportation. Swiss <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna purchased <italic>Witkowitz</italic> iron works and the rights to expand his railroad to Gmunden. Although Vienna bank <italic>Schwarzenberg </italic>shuttered in 1830, Prince Joseph Schwarzenberg\u2019s son was the largest landowner in Bohemia.\nAlso in 1829, Austria granted <italic>Danube Shipping</italic>\u2014founded by<italic> </italic>British ship builders John Andrews, Joseph Pritchard\u2014a chartered monopoly, with a board including <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic> and <italic>Sina</italic>. In 1830, the company issued shares to archdukes Ferdinand and Joseph, Count Reviczky, Chancellor Prince Klemens Metternich, <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic>, <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic>, Adolph Pereira Arnstein, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna, and <italic>Sina</italic>. Expanding into Bohemia, <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic> invested in <italic>Bud\u011bjovice-Linz</italic> RR by 1831.\nSince Austria enacted laws to eliminate the rabbinic judicial system in Bohemia and Austrian Galicia by requiring rabbis to hold secular degrees and receive low wages of the late 18th century, the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> spurred calls for reform. As the Chief Rabbi of Moravia intervened in elections to eliminate reform rabbis from the 1830s, Austria enforced these laws and Russia enacted them as well and spread Haskalah. Likewise, the end of Jewish regional tax collection replaced democratic elections with hereditary communal rabbinical leadership like that of the aristocracy, reviving practices rejected in the Medieval times.\nWith the discovery of coal in Ostrava, Moravia, in 1840, David Gutmann brought samples to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna, whom he convinced to invest in developing coal. Like his paternal grandfather married into a wealthy family after moving from Bohemia to Moravia in the mid-18th century, Gutmann\u2019s mother was an extended cousin of the Primator of Prague, related to the K\u00f6nigswarter and Oppenheim families, while his aunt married a Latzko, descended from Chief Rabbi of Poland Judah Lowe and Katz and a cousin-in-law of the Ulmans through the Pollaks. After his brother Wilhelm married a Katz-Latzko descendant in 1850, the brothers founded <italic>Gutmann</italic> in Vienna in 1853, which became a key supplier of coal across the Empire.\nWhile Trieste insurer <italic>Generali</italic> expanded to France (1832), Switzerland and Germany (1835), Saxony, Prussia, and Silesia (1837), Corfu, Bavaria, and Poland (1838), and Belgrade (1856), Zahony and Morpurgo were removed from the board in 1835 as <italic>Luzzatto</italic> allied Masino Levi joined as secretary general. So, Elio Morpurgo and Marco Parente formed<italic> Morpurgo Parente</italic> by 1837, financing shipping, currency exchange, and bills of exchange from Trieste to Vienna, Prague, Paris, and London with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna credit. The following year <italic>Adriatico Banco</italic> started <italic>Riunione Adriatica di Sicurt\u00e0</italic><italic> </italic>in Trieste, but she remained Italy\u2019s second-largest insurer following <italic>Generali</italic>. \nDespite allowing <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna to begin linking Vienna to the Adriatic coast, Austria hindered private investment in Galicia, planning to establish state railways in 1841. Since 1836, Solomon Rothschild linked Vienna to the Adriatic. As part of a railway connecting Hamburg to Odessa, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna secured a concession for <italic>Austrian</italic><italic> </italic>RR to link Viennese markets, industrial Moravia and Silesia, and agricultural Galicia. \nLikewise, <italic>Sina</italic> kinterlinked with the Macedonian merchant and Romanian noble Ghica family and obtained a concession to expand railroads south with <italic>Pressburger-</italic><italic>Todesco</italic>. Since his Pressburger father adopted the Todesco name, Hermann Pressburger-Todesco engaged in the silk and cotton trades near Vienna. After he married a Wertheim-in-law Kaulla after the death of his first wife, his children soon married a Porges and a Gompertz. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1841</italic>, as <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic> tapped credit for liquidity at <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic>, President of the Chamber of Commerce K\u00fcbeck accused<italic> Geym\u00fcller</italic> of deceit and restricted central bank credit. Despite Metternich\u2019s intervention <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic> filed for bankruptcy and fled abroad as the state lent to <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic>\u2019s counterparties to prevent more bankruptcies. Without aiding <italic>Geym\u00fcller</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna took over their former shared operations in Austrian Bohemia. \nHaving solved the transportation barriers, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s coal and asphalt operations in Dalmatia were hindered by local priests in 1845. Solomon Rothschild asked Emperor Ferdinand to instruct Archbishop Giuseppe Godeassi of Zara to intercede. Despite clergy opposition, Rothschild received imperial support. At the same time, he was negotiating with Austrian to establish salt works in Venice to supply Lombardy.\nMeanwhile, <italic>Sina</italic> competed with tobacco magnate and Court Jew descendant Mors Ulman of Hungary to fund Hungary\u2019s first railroad, <italic>Pest-Vac </italic>RR. Since trading grain and lobbying for a bank, Ulman converted<italic> </italic>to Christianity in 1825 and funded <italic>Pest-Vac </italic>RR. So, the Emperor finally allowed Ulman to parlay his tobacco profits to found <italic>Hungarian Creditbank </italic>and <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>. But despite banking reform, Hungary continued to prohibit Jewish citizenship, leading Ulman and Finaly family members as well as the head of Pest\u2019s congregation, Jonas Kunewalder, to convert.\nSince Warsaw-born Prince Leon Sapieha participated to in the <italic>Uprising of 1830</italic>, he fled Russia and settled in Austrian Galicia, where he developed industries. In 1840, he and Count Fredro received approval for a competitor to <italic>Austrian</italic><italic> </italic>RR. Founding <italic>Galician Mortgage </italic><italic>Credit </italic><italic>Society </italic>in 1841, Sapieha and Galician landowners to construct <italic>Bochnia-</italic><italic>Lemberg</italic><italic>-Berezhany</italic> RR, forming a joint-stock company in 1844. Following a reverse migration from Galician Brody to Ukrainian Zlatopol, a Katz-descendant adopted the name Mayer Brodsky, and had five sons who all became businessmen. Israel Brodsky, the wealthiest of the five brothers, began investing in Ukraine\u2019s emerging sugar industry in the 1840s. \nWithout influential sponsors, there was little progress in <italic>Saint-Petersburg-Moscow</italic> RR. However, <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland </italic>secured support from the Russian Viceroy to establish a joint-stock railroad to link Warsaw to the Austrian <italic>Austrian</italic><italic> </italic>RR. With the Viceroy\u2019s influence, the company obtained a steam power concession in 1839 with a guarantee of a 4% return on capital. While Russia funded an advance, the <italic>Panic of 1841</italic> curtailed credit and the government rejected requests for increased capital. As the company dissolved in 1842, the Russia assumed construction. While <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland </italic>leased out the Dabrowa Basin\u2019s iron works since 1833, coking coal scarcity caused challenges, resulting in a shift back to state control by 1842, and stagnation thereafter.\nAlthough not a Katz, the Polyakov family of the Mogilev Province in Belarus of Polish Russia descended from one of Baal Shem Tov\u2019s disciples to build a Hasidic Court and secure a regional alcohol monopoly. When Russia annexed Poland, Lazar moved to Dubrovno in 1793 and adopted the surname Polyakov. As Lazar\u2019s wealth grew, his son Solomon later ran a store with his wife Zlata Rabinovich of Minsk. After Solomon died in 1804, Zlata relocated to Orsha and independently ran the business, securing loans to buy textiles from Moscow. As Russia gained control of alcohol sales in 1816, Solomon\u2019s brother left Belarus for Ukraine and became railway contractors. By 1842, hard times, however, led Solomon\u2019s son to Moscow in search of work.\nAfter expelling 50,000 Jews in 1843, Russia imposed repressive community measures, including prohibitions and taxes. While rabbis, Prussia\u2019s Ambassador, and Solomon Rothschild intervened, their attempts were unsuccessful. As Tsar Nicholas delegalized kahals in 1844, Mark Gunzburg debated Jewish education reform in Russia with Berdichev banker Jakob Halpern\u2019s son David, Rabbi Israel Friedman\u2019s son-in-law, and Leon Ephrussi married Katz-descendant Rabbi of Prague Ezekiel Landau\u2019s fourth great-granddaughter. \nSince partnering with Zeitlin-in-law Peretz, with a Stiglitz brother from Ukrainian Kherson, moved to Saint-Petersburg to build ships in the 1810s. As Kherson developed, Markus Warshavsky supplied provisions, timber and built shipyards in Kherson and Nikolaev and producing vessels like gunboats. Likewise, Abraham Rafalovich joined Kherson\u2019s merchant class in 1830. In 1843, Markus\u2019 son Moisey contracted to build a bridge across the Tiligul River but failed and his property was auctioned as his son  Abram wed the daughter of Poltava First Guild tax farmer Portugalov. \nBy 1848, Jews owned three of the six second-guild merchant capitals in Kherson as Warshavsky, Rafalovich, and Peretz had contributed to regional trade. Abram Peretz supplied timber and provisions and undertook shipbuilding for the Black Sea Fleet. Warshavsky, Halpern, Rafalovich, and Peretz consistently engaged in contracts supplying Kherson, Nikolaev, and Odessa, participating in provisioning and infrastructure.\nAfter Abraham Rafalovich\u2019s son Arthur converted and changed his name to Alekseevich, brother Fedor married a Lowensohn and converted to Russian Orthodoxy, and a third brother married a Morpurgo in 1848. (After his Morpurgo wife died, he married a Lowensohn.) Abraham\u2019s daughters married Katz-descendant Ashkenasy traders of Belarus (cousins of Hirschel Levi, the Chief Rabbi of British Ashkenazi) and Toeplitz of Warsaw. \nBy 1850, Berdichev saw the opening of its first public school offering instruction in Russian. But the town experienced an economic decline as wealthier maskilim began leaving for Odessa. As Berdichev\u2019s population continued growing, so did poverty. With Bohemian origins, the Toeplitz family moved to Posen before settling in Warsaw in the late 18th century. The union of a Toeplitz and Samuel Zbytkower\u2019s Oesterreicher granddaughter\u2014a cousin of the Epshteyns\u2014Warsaw-born Henryk Toeplitz married Anna Levinsohn Rafalovich in 1849, but she passed away after giving birth to their children. Henryk\u2019s cousin married another of Zbytkower\u2019s descendants in 1852. Likewise, Toeplitz kinterlinked with Kronenberg in 1851. \nIn Poland\u2019s first significant conversion since Samuel Frankel in 1806, fellow Warsaw banker Leo Kronenberg converted in 1845 amidst pressure as he bid for the tobacco monopoly from another converted Jew, Moritz Cohen, followed by the Bloch brothers\u2014third great-grandsons of Katz-descendant Zevi Ashkenasy and so a cousin once removed of Chief Rabbi of Britain Hirschel Levin with extended banker cousins including the Hamburger and Goldschmidt families\u2014who joined <italic>Toeplitz</italic>, Jacob Epshteyn\u2019s son Jan, and other Jewish bankers converted to Christianity in the 1850s. \nDespite initial setbacks, <italic>Rothschild</italic> and <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland </italic>financed Russia\u2019s state-owned <italic>Warsaw-Vienna</italic> RR. The first section to Grodzisk started in 1845, and the entire stretch connecting Warsaw to <italic>Austrian</italic><italic> </italic>RR commenced in 1848. Moreover, <italic>Warsaw-Vienna</italic> RR linked Zyrardow, Czenstochowa, and Dabrowa to stimulate agriculture, mining, and industry. The industrialization fueled local Jewish entrepreneurship. Jacob Epshteyn\u2019s son Hermann modernized Warsaw\u2019s sugar refineries from the 1840s. Similarly, Samuel Natanson pioneered the soap industry. Likewise, banks began forming in Poland. \nChristians also benefited. Serfs of the dominant Russian Orthodox faith became nobles. After his Christian serf gardener father gained freedom in 1813, Peter Eliseev opened a fruit trade in Saint-Petersburg. Upon Peter\u2019s death in 1825, his widow Maria and their three sons grew and diversified the shops. As one of the brothers joined the first guild in 1842, all three Eliseev brothers received hereditary honorary citizenships in 1845. \nOld Believers also benefited as VA Kokorev, the son of a salt merchant, became an agent for a vodka tax farmer, soon becoming very wealthy. Old Believer endogamous marriages also continued fostering strategic alliances. As Fedor Simonov passed away in 1846, but his brother arranged a marriage between Fedor\u2019s daughter Maria and Savva\u2019s son Timofei. After equipping textile mills like the Savva Morozov\u2019s manufactory in 1847, Manchester banker <italic>DeJersey</italic>\u2019s Ludwig Knoop established <italic>Krenholm Manufacturing Co</italic>, and invested in other Old Believer textile factories.\nAlong Belarus\u2019 Polish-Ukrainian border, <italic>Zhabinka-Brest</italic> RR completed in 1844. Since the Russo-Polish border faded in 1795, Pinsk\u2019s Jewry turned the city into an inland port with canals to export natural resources. Along with spreading Haskalah in Pinsk, Katz-descendent Shaul Karliner amassed wealth from timber and contracts and married Mirke Gunzburg, Gabriel Gunzburg\u2019s first cousin once removed. While Shaul Karliner\u2019s eldest son, Zalman continued selling timber, Moshe traded timber, corn, and fats. After their sister Chaya married fellow Katz-descendent Louri\u00e9, she soon became a widow and managed family trade. Continuing her father\u2019s opposition to Hasidism, she and her sons commercialized and industrialized Pinsk.\nBut with progress and competition came disruption. Since Jewish merchants dominated the alcohol exports in Rechitsa in southeastern Belarus, his son Abram Shaikevich held tax-farming rights for Minsk and Pinsk and supplied alcohol, timber, and provisions to the military in the 1830s. In 1841, he lost his tax lease after failing to pay excise duties. In 1843, the merchant class grew to 18, with Abram as the only first-guild member. By 1845, Abram was in debt and the court ordered the sale of his and his father\u2019s property. Around that time, his likely cousin, Isaac Shaikevich, the son of a timber merchant, married the daughter of a wealthy freight trader Gavriel Goldberg in Neswisch near Minsk, through which Eastern European grain shipped for export.  \nBy the early 1800s, Meir Chayes engaged in banking out of Brody in Austrian Galicia and Florence. Tracing roots to Portugal until the late 14th century, the Chayes funded the construction of Prague\u2019s <italic>Altschuler Synagogue</italic>. Out of Tarnobrzeg, western Galicia, Katz-descendant Leiser Wahl secured the liquor monopoly and traded timber in the 1830s. However, without Katz linkages, Haskalah and Hasidism clashed. Since Rabbi Eleasar Kallir preached across Austria, his daughter married Katz-descendant David Horowitz by 1805. \nEleasar\u2019s son Alex became a merchant in Galician Brody. While Alex\u2019s progressive grandson Mayer became a wealthy merchant of Brody, Galician Hasidim received a boost when Rabbi Israel Friedman fled to Galician Bukovina from Russian oppression. When a rabbi sought build a modern synagogue and abolish ritualistic taxes, he faced resistance from Hasidim and their wealthy tax-collector patrons. His reform attempts led to his murder amid the <italic>Revolution of </italic><italic>1848</italic>. Subsequently, Mayer Kallir addressed resistance to reform by promoting farming.\nFor the first time since 1816, when <italic>Arnstein</italic> <italic>Eskeles </italic>formed the Austrian banknote monopoly in Vienna, <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> opened her first discount branch in Prague in 1847, which Leo L\u00e4mel had long advocated for and joined the branch\u2019s board. Without banknotes, Galicia and Austria\u2019s other provinces relied on private pawn letters. When <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> halted redemption of banknotes during the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, silver disappeared throughout the monarchy, leading secured pawn letters to trade at a premium to banknotes. \nThe massive outflow of capital from Austria created a budget deficit and allowed <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s consortium to take over Sapieha\u2019s Galician railroads. Amidst the bloody riots of 1848 in Vienna,<italic> </italic>Salomon Rothschild and Foreign Minister Metternich fled the city. As antisemitic riots broke out in Fej\u00e9r, Hungary, citizens voted to expel the Jews until the threat of military intervention led them to rescind the order. \nThe wool and grain trading Baumgarten family\u2014large shareholders of <italic>Hungarian Commercial Bank</italic>\u2014became large landowners after Austria split the Crown with agricultural Hungary and allowed Jews to own land from 1849. Likewise, <italic>Rothchild</italic> Vienna would come to own a quarter of the large properties in Bohemia, along with their railroad properties across the empire. Like Jewish restrictions ended in Prague, Vienna, and Galicia after the March revolution, Austria abolished special Jewish taxes and included emancipation in the constitution, and Hungary enacted Jewish emancipation.\nDespite religious emancipation, Austria remained a multi-ethnic empire. Like they did for the <italic>Holy Alliance</italic> in 1822, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna financed Austria to quash revolts from Austrian Milan to Piedmont. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> supported the Habsburgs, Sephardi <italic>Camondo</italic>\u2014affiliated with Venice and Turkish Constantinople and Wallachia\u2014and Bischoffsheim\u2019s in-law<italic> </italic>Joseph Cah\u00e9n unsuccessfully funded the Italians. \nSimilarly, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels-affiliated Frankfurt and Paris bankers funded Milan\u2019s 1848 provisional government and Filippo Schott Weill\u2014of the Frankfurt Schotts and cousin of the Oppenheim and Katz families\u2014who moved from Austrian Baden to Milan in 1848 and sold rifles to Lombardy\u2019s provisional government with credit from <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Brussels in-law and Rothschild cousin <italic>Reinach</italic>. Thereafter, Filippo and his cousins created Milan<italic> </italic>bank <italic>Schott Weill.</italic> \nIn Venice, Abramo Errera supported revolutionary Daniel Manin during the 1848 uprising against Austria. His father, Beniamino\u2014a son of a Sephardi refugee from Aleppo in 1720\u2014married the daughter of a wealthy Venetian Luzzatto and founded the bank<italic> Errera</italic>. His son Abramo married into the Jacur family of Venice and Trieste, which was linked to the Morpurgo family. In the early 1830s, Abramo became President of the Jewish community of Venice. He inherited <italic>Errera</italic>, invested in Venetian pearl manufacturing, and participated in infrastructure projects, including <italic>Milan-Venice</italic> RR, which he directed until its transfer to government control in 1846. After the revolution failed, Abramo co-founded <italic>Stabilimento Mercantile Bank</italic> in 1852.\nThrough the 1840s, Jews fled the Papal lands to Trieste. Only in 1848 did Austrian emancipation of Jews begin democratization. Upon overthrowing the Papal State nobility, revolutionaries declared the Roman Republic in 1849. As the Pope Pius IX sought a loan to return, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris and Naples demanded better conditions for Jews in the Roman ghetto and a mortgage on Church property. After initial negative reaction, pressure from France and Austria led the Pope to accept the terms in 1850. But as the Papal States regained control over Ferrara, they punished Jews. With Jews subject to the Inquisition\u2019s permission to leave the city, <italic>Pisa</italic> left to Austrian Milan in the 1850s. \nAfter the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, <italic>Bank of Genoa</italic> merged with the new <italic>Bank of Turin</italic> into <italic>Banca Nazionale</italic>, leading Ferrari to leave the board as <italic>Parodi</italic> remained. Piedmont\u2019s Bourbon King granted Jews equal rights in 1848. Since Rothschild cousin Abram Leonino, Sabino\u2019s son, was an auditor at <italic>Bank of Genoa</italic> he joined <italic>Banca Nazionale</italic>\u2019s board in 1850. <italic>Parodi</italic> continued working closely with<italic> Rothschild </italic>through her Turin agent Gustave Landauer, a descendant of Goldschmidts and Bauers and an in-law and partner of<italic> Morpurgo</italic>. While <italic>Leonino</italic> London dissolved in 1854, Sabino Leonino settled in Genoa, <italic>Avigdor</italic> cofounded <italic>Transatlantica</italic> steamships to South America in 1852 and kinterlinked with a daughter of Joseph Kaulla and Sarah Hirsch in 1854, forming <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt Avigdor</italic> in London. Likewise, <italic>Parodi</italic> joined with several other bankers to create <italic>Cassa Generale</italic>, as an anonymous securities investment company. \nAs <italic>Laffitte</italic> of Paris and British financiers promoted <italic>Vittorio Emanuele</italic> RR to connect Lombardy and France,<italic> Rothschild</italic> Paris financed projects in the French-client Piedmont. However, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s stringent terms led the Kingdom to seek alternative sources. By 1851, <italic>Hambro</italic> London provided a loan to Piedmont to develop the Turin railway and other infrastructure. From Denmark, Carl Hambro, the baptized son of the Court Jew of Denmark, established <italic>Hambro</italic> London in 1840. While his son, Carl, was baptized at fifteen, with limited involvement with the London Jewish community, both Joseph and Carl Joachim maintained strong connections with the Copenhagen community.\nFollowing the <italic>Panic </italic><italic>of 1848</italic>, Bavaria\u2019s legislature rejected Jewish emancipation in 1850. A year later, the government passed a law removing legal distinctions between Jews and Christians in marriage, property, and inheritance, but Jews continued fleeing to America. Freeing serfs and Jews like Prussia and Bavaria, Austria also split the Crown with agricultural Hungary. While Austria extended the law of Galicia and Bohemia to Hungary in 1848, rabbinic courts retained their power. Moreover, Hungary\u2019s Minister of Finance commissioned <italic>Hungarian Creditbank</italic> to issue banknotes independently of <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> up to five times greater than reserves. \nIn the Hungarian frontier, the Deutsch family prospered. Their progenitor was Abraham Deutsch, a son of a Moravian rabbi, who moved from K\u0151szeg on the Austro-Hungarian border to Arad on the Hungaro-Wallachian border as a shopkeeper. He became a grain supplier during the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> and gained wealth as a wholesaler.  Abraham Deutsch\u2019s Moravian-born son Isaac became a grocer in 1820 before founding Hungary\u2019s first sugar refinery in Arad, marrying into wealth, and becoming a lords\u2019 Jew. \nIn 1838, he became the Arad agent for <italic>Generali</italic> and joined the board of Arad\u2019s first bank in 1844. After the <italic>R</italic><italic>evolution of 1848</italic>, Deutsch obtained Arad citizenship and expanded into banking and grain trading. While rallying against <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna and other foreign reformists, he supported suspension of Jewish landholding. While his sister-in-law wed grain magnate Moritz Ulman\u2019s son, Deutsch\u2019s daughter married Samuel Brillin, a descendant of the Mandl Prefects of Hungarian Jews and rabbis of Moravia.\nWhile Austria continued the ban on Jewish ownership in Galicia, Katz-in-law Kallir elected to the Galician Parliament in 1848, was kinterlinked with Katz-descendant Landau and started Galicia\u2019s first large private bank. Soon branching from Brody to Leipzig and Vienna, Kallir shaped Austrian customs policies in 1850. Although Austria's 1849 Constitution made Bukovina independent from Galicia and granted Jews property rights, an 1853 amendment limited those rights.\nDuring the Hungarian uprising, Russia first utilized railroads to transport troops from Russian Poland to Austrian Moravia. Within a year, during the crisis with Prussia, railroads transported Austrian and Hungarian troops into Silesia. As Austria constructed strategic rails, Russia followed. Strong connections to French trade spurred Tsar Nicholas to make Gabriel Gunzburg an honorary and hereditary citizen in 1848. Out of Paris, one of Sina\u2019s sons also connected to Russia, managing aristocrat capital, while also financing religious propaganda in the Balkans and opposing <italic>Rothschild</italic> and Jewish international capital. \nWhile Prussian officials called for a modern bank in Moldova, Russia vetoed such plans. After peasant protests and inflation in 1846, the Consul General reported bankruptcies by <italic>Daniel</italic>\u2019s cousin-in-law Solomon Feigeles and four other Jewish bankers, and accused <italic>Daniel</italic> of Jassy of facilitating credit fraud. As his brother-in-law Grigore Ghica and others revolted amidst the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, Prince Sturza supported a note-issuing bank. However, disturbances prevented the implementation, and his successor, Ghica, faced budget deficits and the need for loans to sustain public spending. \nTaking over Jassy bank <italic>Daniel</italic> from his father by 1848, Israel Daniel led Jewish leaders and merchants in establishing a Haskalah management committee the following year. While fellow Jassy banker Leiba Cahane worked with <italic>Daniel </italic>and partnered with Moise Vecsler, his son married a descendant of Court Jew Mark Meisel, and his daughter wed Lemberg-born rabbinical scholar Moshe Waldberg\u2014possibly a Byk cousin\u2014around 1850. Waldberg\u2019s sister married a descendant of Koppel Frankel. He later shifted to banking in Bucharest. \nOther Jews grew as well in Jassy. Starting as minor exchanger, Moldovan Jacob Neuschotz<italic> </italic>became a dealers of merchants and boyars. So did and Galician <italic>Ornstein</italic><italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic><italic>Byk</italic>. Leading the Jews of Lemberg for generations, the Ornsteins kinterlinked with Katz descendants of Zevi Ashkenasy, connecting to Hirschel Levin. the Chief Rabbi of Britain. and the Bloch family of Poland.\nA Katz descendant whose forefathers traded in Brody, Alex Byk was a nephew of a Rappaport descended from Zevi Ashkenasy, whose descendants served as rabbis of Letichev in Russo-Ukrainian Podolia. While his cousin once removed married the daughter of Isaac Zabludowsky in Bialystok, other Byks had kinterlinked with  <italic>Rafalovich</italic> cousins Pernas in Lemberg and engaged in grain export and estate leasing. Likewise, his sister married a Halpern and Byk\u2019s son became a banker of Leipzig and his daughter married an Ashkenasy-descendant and a Nathansohn cousin of Horace Landau by 1850. \nIn Bucharest, Jewish <italic>Halfon</italic> kinterlinked with Wallachian-rooted<italic> Camondo </italic>of Constantinople, who concurrently kinterlinked with Morpurgo and Allatini\u2019s in-laws of Salonica. While <italic>Halfon</italic>, <italic>Marmorosch</italic>, and their co-religionists financed Romanian trade in the 1850s, <italic>Manoach</italic> was Moldova\u2019s chief creditor out of Bucharest. \nAs she tried to do elsewhere, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris dissuaded Russia from allowing <italic>Mobilier </italic>to enter. Like in the days of Polish rule, privileged Jewish tax farmers interlinked Russia outside of the <italic>Pale</italic>. Across Podolia,<italic> Gunzburg</italic> kinterlinked with descendants of Simeon Epstein from Belarus and Poland, hiring his Katz-descendant grandson Abraham Zak, who soon became his Chief Accountant. Since Joseph Gunzburg married Katz and Meisel descendant Dynin of Warsaw in 1830, Solomon Poliakov\u2019s sons Samuel and Iakov of Belarus took private lessons with Dynin. \nAfter marrying Amalia Lifshchitz and working for her uncle and his partner\u2014who was related to Schneur Zalman, the founder of Chabad Hasidism, and Prince Potemkin\u2019s Court Advisor Joshua Zeitlin\u2014Iakov became the managing tax farmer of Orsha by 1855. By then, his brother Samuel wed a daughter of mercantile Epstein, likely a Gunzburg and Zak cousin-in-law. \nSince Greeks revolted against Turkey for Christian sovereignty in 1822, armed Samians attacked Chios, sparking conflict. The Ottoman Empire responded with a fleet and thousands of Turkish fighters, framing the conflict as a holy war, like the Greek rebels. This led to violence, with many Greeks killed, including around Salonica, which grew more Jewish. \nAfter the crisis, Chiots and other Greeks, including <italic>Ionides</italic>, <italic>Schilizzi</italic>, <italic>Ralli</italic>, and <italic>Rodocanachi</italic> traders kinterlinked with the diaspora in Constantinople, Izmir, London, Vienna, Odessa, France, and Austrian Trieste, where <italic>Ralli</italic> co-founded <italic>Adriatico Banco</italic> by 1826. As the Ionian Islands had been British since 1815, those families that gained BOE access had an advantage in the Odessa grain trade. Ionides, for example, formed<italic> Discount Bank</italic> in London in 1833. However, France lacked MMBU without <italic>Baring</italic><italic></italic><italic></italic>-like merchant banks. Greek shippers soon relied on <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> <italic>Goldschmidt</italic> and other banks for French grain credit.\nMarseille became a significant colony of the Greek diaspora. In 1826, Chiot Rodocanachi moved there from Livorno and established the trading house <italic>Rodocanachi</italic> Marseille, linking Syros, Odessa, Livorno, London, and Chios. After Demetrius Baltazzi arrived in the 1830s, <italic>Baltazzi</italic> cousin-in-law and Th\u00e9odore Rodocanachi\u2019s stepson Georges Zarifi established a grain trading network in Odessa and a branch in Marseille by 1845, specializing in Black Sea grain trade. \nAssociated with <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, Georges Zarifi\u2019s son Pericles married Rodocanachi\u2019s daughter. Since importing Russian wheat, Demetrius Baltazzi arrived in Marseille in the 1830s. While Demetrius\u2019 nephew Theodore trained with <italic>Sina</italic> in Vienna, Theodore\u2019s brother was a banker in Constantinople and married a Carath\u00e9odory Ottoman governor of Moldova, and their sister married a Vogoridi brother-in-law of Moldovan Prince Mihail Sturdza,\nDescended from the Lyonnaise bourgeoisie, Jacques All\u00e9on began his career as a clerk in Constantinople with French merchant before founding his own trading house, <italic>All\u00e9on</italic>, in 1822. By the 1830s, he became involved in major financial operations for the Ottoman Empire, including managing Greece's emancipation debt repayment to Turkey in 1834, collecting copper coins from 1834 to 1842, securing loans for the Treasury in 1840, and trading with <italic>Sina</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>. From 1843, the Ottoman government contracted All\u00e9on and Sina\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Austro-Greek Theodore Baltazzi, to stabilize the exchange rate. As the agreement was renewed, All\u00e9on offered shelter to George Zarifi, who had been displaced by a fire. \nBy 1847, Baltazzi and All\u00e9on co-founded <italic>Bank of Constantinople</italic> under government auspices with Zarifi as an intermediary. However, as the government only implemented the creation of new currency and ignored other reforms, the <italic>Panic</italic><italic> of 1848</italic> disrupted <italic>Bank of Constantinople</italic>. While Demetrius Baltazzi became a Director of <italic>Comptoir</italic> Marseille from 1848, Bordeaux and <italic>Comptoir </italic>controlled <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic> from 1853. While his siblings engaged with <italic>Comptoir</italic>, Georges Zarifi and his uncle \u00c9tienne Zafiropoulo founded <italic>Zafiropoulo Zarifi</italic>, focusing on grain trade between the Black Sea and France. \nAs the <italic>Panic</italic><italic> of 1848</italic> disrupted Turkish trade, <italic>Bank of Constantinople</italic> faced a debt crisis and was liquidated by 1853. As Zarifi negotiated with <italic>Baring</italic> to create a new bank, <italic>Baltazzi</italic> and Camondo made a competing proposal. In April 1853, the Sultan approved Zarifi\u2019s proposal, but financial difficulties and the outbreak of the <italic>Crimean War</italic> caused the abandonment of the project in 1854. During this period, Galata bankers of Constantinople, including those from <italic>Zafiropoulo Zarifi</italic>, financed the Ottoman Empire. Likewise, <italic>Zafiropoulo Zarifi</italic>, <italic>Baltazzi</italic>, and others helped to supply coal to the Anglo-French allies during the war, playing a crucial role in supporting the empire's war effort. \nHowever, as Russia blockaded the Black Sea during the war, the Anglo-Greek Ukrainian grain trade collapsed, inflating prices and spurring famine from Naples to Austrian Venice. Since Zafiropoulo\u2019s brother-in-law textile trader Alex Ionides founded <italic>Discount Bank</italic> in London in 1833, the bank failed in 1854, he became Consul of Greece in London from and co-founded <italic>Bank of London</italic> in 1855. \nFrom 1855, Piedmont fought on behalf of the Ottomans, with financing from the Morpurgo Vitta family. <italic>Vagliano</italic> smuggled grain exports from the Azov to Constantinople. As an Ionian subject of the British Empire, Panaghi Vagliano was sent to Britain in 1858, where he opened a BOE account and represented Danubian Greek grain mercantile interests. Gaining access to <italic>Baltic Exchange</italic>, he later established London\u2019s first exclusively Greek shipping office.\nAgainst Russia and Greece, Britain, Turkey printed inflationary amounts of paper money and relied on French, Austrian, and Piedmontite loans from <italic>Rothschild </italic>(via Horace Landau), Huguenot <italic>Andre</italic>, and <italic>Camondo</italic> out of Constantinople. Landau\u2019s former partner <italic>Biedermann</italic> of Vienna soon kinterlinked with<italic> Bischoffsheim</italic> <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>. \nSince acquiring a railway from Prussian Silesia to Krakau, Austria extended the road towards Galician Lemberg to transport troops and supplies from Vienna against Russia. Halting at Premissel due to financial strain in 1855, Austria offered the concession to <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s group, who declined due to financial conflicts with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic>. So, Radziwill cousin Prince Leon Sapieha and other Galicia landowners secured the concession to extend towards Moldova and partnered with <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, <italic>L\u00e4mel</italic>, <italic>Pressburger-</italic><italic>Todesco</italic>, and <italic>Austrian</italic> RR. \nAs Russia waged the <italic>Crimean War</italic> against Turkey from 1853, Gunzburg and Warshavsky supplied goods and clothing to the Russian army in Ukraine, <italic>Stiglitz</italic> floated war debt via <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> Berlin and <italic>Hope</italic> in Amsterdam. <italic>Stieglitz</italic>\u2019s reputation soared internationally as her promissory notes widely accepted across Europe, America, and Asia. \nIn the Turkish Balkans, Russia\u2019s veto of a Moldovan bank ended with her loss in the <italic>Crimea War</italic>, allowing Pasha Ghica\u2019s government and Friedrich Nulandt, a Protestant founder of a Dessau credit institute, to establish <italic>Moldovan</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>in 1856. The bank soon granted mortgages to aristocratic landowners and politicians of the Sturza, Ghica, and Sturza Mavrogheni cousinhood. While forced to suspended payments in the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>, the bank survived. \nAnd as Leo L\u00e4mel was ennobled by Austria in 1856, he joined Prince Metternich and others in a concession for a railway network from Prague to the Bavarian border. Although disagreement forced the syndicate to partner with <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> and <italic>K\u00f6nigswarter </italic>by 1859. Since <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Austrian Bank</italic> opened her first discount branch in Prague in 1847, <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> branched to Prague in 1857, but did not engage in industrial activities. Instead of banks, savings institutions for Czech farmers started in the late 1850s.\nIn 1857, Moldovan Prince Mihail Sturdza\u2019s brother-in-law Nicholai Vogoridi elevated <italic>Daniel</italic>\u2019s Israel Daniel to the rank of sp\u00e5tar, since he financed the Ottoman tribute through discounted salt revenues in 1854. Daniel soon did some business with Moise Vecsler, who was a banker with Leiba Cahane until 1855. Still, the three bankers collaborated, including on Moldova\u2019s largest state loan in 1861. While Cahane made a loan to Pasha Obolinschi\u2014after <italic>Moldovan</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>refused the unsecured loan\u2014and other risky borrowers, Vecsler was more careful, but also provided loans and participated in ventures with Princess Vogoridi Sturdza. After  Moise Vecsler\u2019s son married a Rappaport Ornstein descendant  of Zevi Ashkenasy in 1858, his daughter wed a grand nephew of Abraham Mises. \nAbraham Mises was a co-founder of the Galician railroad. While his father was an assessor of Brody\u2019s bill court, his maternal family engaged in Russo-German exporter <italic>Halberstam Nirenstein</italic>. In 1836, Abraham married his Katz-descendant Halberstam cousin, connected to the Landau and Kallir families. In 1842, after the death of his father, he established a wholesale business. Over the next two years, his siblings married a <italic>Kallir</italic> cousin and banker Samuel Rappaport Kl\u00e4rmann. In 1856, another sister married banker Ignaz Bernstein, and<italic> Mises</italic> branched to Vienna and co-founded the Galician railroad. The following year, he joined the directorate of <italic>Imperial Austrian Bank</italic>\u2019s Lemberg branch. In 1859, the Vienna firm secured grain procurement for the Austrian army. In 1860, Abraham became head of <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Lemberg.\nIn Auschwitz, between Krakau and Lemberg, Chaim Schenker ran a textile shop and married a descendant of Solomon Luria\u2019s sister and Jakubek the Wealthy of Krakau. In the mid-1800s, Schenker leased Auschwitz estates from Parliamentary member Count Jozef Russocki. As the railroad pass through his land, Schenker sold part of the estate to the railway company to pay off his mortgage and he gained control of the estate and served as an assessor. Schenker\u2019s daughter married Wolf Landau, an unknown but likely relations of Brody merchants, and the family engaged in trade and finance. After Count Russocki joined the commission to reorg <italic>Galician Mortgage Credit Society </italic>in 1861.\nUnited against <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Mobilier</italic><italic></italic><italic></italic><italic></italic>-affiliated <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic>,<italic> </italic><italic>Sina</italic>, and Hungarian Count Zichy built a railway into the Austrian frontier, joining Huguenots in 1855 to start <italic>ORIENT </italic>RR and link Vienna to Constantinople. At the same time, Anglo-Greek Peter Pasquali founded the first large bank in Ottoman domains <italic>Egyptian Bank</italic>, with funding from<italic> Westminster Bank</italic>. Although established to foster Anglo-Egyptian trade, the bank quickly engaged in financing Egyptian government projects. And since supplying coal to the Anglo-French allies, <italic>Baltazzi</italic> cousin-in-law <italic>Zafiropoulo</italic> <italic>Zarifi</italic> leased the Ottoman\u2019s Heraclea coal mine. \nFollowing the failure of <italic>Banque de Constantinople</italic>, <italic>Baltazzi</italic> partnered with <italic>Glyn </italic>to establish <italic>Ottoman Bank</italic> in 1856, aiming to consolidate tax-backed <italic>Crimean War</italic> debts. The following year, British investors Samuel Laing, Matthew Uzielli, and Thomas Brassey\u2014with ties to <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>, sought to create a bank to finance large-scale Ottoman infrastructure projects, but their efforts faltered amid the economic turmoil of the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>. \nNevertheless, British ambassadors soon convinced the Turks for concessions, leading to the construction of a railway in Wallachia connecting Constanta on the Black Sea to inland Cernavoda for grain transport. British <italic>Barkley</italic> built <italic>Danube & Black</italic> <italic>Sea</italic> RR, and soon others nearby. And in the Jewish metropolis of Turkish Salonica on the border with Greece, Morpurgo cousins Allatini developed the Ottoman Empire\u2019s flour milling industry with the first steam-powered flour mill in the Eastern Mediterranean with French investment.\nLikewise, <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels and <italic>Rothschild </italic>kinterlinked with Italians. While the son of Venetian banker Abramo Errera\u2019s son trained with <italic>Reinach</italic> in Brussels and married Adolph Oppenheim\u2019s daughter in 1857, <italic>Rothschild</italic> established <italic>Bank of Commerce & Industry of Turin</italic> in Piedmont by 1857 to block competition from Pereire. Since Rothschild-in-laws <italic>Leonino</italic> moved from London to Genoa in 1854, Sabino Leonino funded the military via his <italic>Leonino</italic> brokerage. As he became councilor at the Chamber of Commerce in 1857 and then married a Pisa cousin Finzi, <italic>Leonino</italic> Genoa promoted <italic>Nassau</italic><italic> </italic>RR. Sabino\u2019s uncle Ippolito Leonino soon directed <italic>Universal Marine Insurance Co</italic>. \nWhile Pisa and Treves were among the few Jews ennobled before the 1820s, Italy ennobled the Morpurgo Vitta family in 1855 for their services during the <italic>Crimean War</italic>. After a Vitta heir married Abramo Franchetti\u2019s daughter in 1857, Italy ennobled Franchetti for his economic activities as his son married Sara Rothschild\u2014the daughter of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s Anselm and the niece of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris\u2019 James, who headed the family\u2014and Abramo\u2019s daughter kinterlinked with <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>. By 1859, another Vitta sibling married an Oppenheim of Hamburg\u2014descended from Samuel Oppenheim, Samson Wertheim, and Michael Speyer\u2014and a <italic>Halphen</italic> cousin-in-law.\nWith Europe seizing much of Russian protected Moldova and Wallachia and unified them into Romania under Turkish sovereignty and under the rule of Dominator of Romania Alexandru Cuza, Russia pursued negotiations to sell her only overseas colony, Alaska, until Tsar Nicholas I died after ruling for thirty years, and his son, Alex II, began modernizing. For domestic industry, Russia tariffed telegraphy cables, leading <italic>Siemens</italic> to start a branch there in 1855. As <italic>Stiglitz</italic> funded railways for mobilization around Saint-Petersburg, the Tsar promoted Alex Stiglitz to State Councilor. Still, Russia had only completed the <italic>Saint-Petersburg-Warsaw</italic> RR and the Warsaw-Austrian frontier railways, with one section of <italic>Saint-Petersburg-Warsaw</italic> RR under construction, all of which were undertaken by the state. \nSince <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris had earlier dissuaded Russia from allowing <italic>Mobilier </italic>to enter, <italic>Stiglitz</italic> considered three groups to construct Russian railroads in 1856, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s <italic>R\u00e9union Financi\u00e8re</italic> backed by London; Oppenheim<italic> </italic>and the Russian Christian <italic>Vonlyarlyarsky</italic> backed by Berlin; and <italic>Pereire</italic>\u2019s syndicate with <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, and <italic>Borski</italic> backed by Paris. Within a year, <italic>Rothschild</italic> dropped out as <italic>Stiglitz</italic> formed the <italic>Grande Soci\u00e9t\u00e9</italic> syndicate with <italic>Frankel</italic>, <italic>Eichthal</italic>, <italic>Mendelssohn</italic>, <italic>Fould Oppenheim</italic>, <italic>Pereire</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Hope</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Seilli\u00e8re</italic>, <italic>Thurneyssen</italic>, and other <italic>Mobilier</italic> shareholders (as Napoleon III vetoed direct <italic>Mobilier </italic>participation). Likewise, British <italic>Johnson</italic> split Russian <italic>Demidov</italic> platinum with French <italic>Quennessen</italic> and German<italic> Heraeus</italic>.<italic> </italic>\nAfter Warsaw banker Herman Epshteyn built Poland\u2019s largest sugar refinery, his niece married a Natanson in 1853 and his son trained with<italic> Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent <italic>Lambert</italic> of Brussels and married into that family in 1855. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt financed Epshteyn\u2019s syndicate to acquire <italic>Warsaw-Vienna</italic> RR with extend her from Warsaw to Bydgoszcz and from Z\u0105bkowice to Katowice as Russia privatized Polish rails, <italic>Toeplitz </italic>extended <italic>Saint-Petersburg-Warsaw </italic>RR. \nToeplitz\u2019s kinterlink with Anna Levinsohn Rafalovich connection continued to reap dividends as Anna\u2019s cousin Ignaz Levinsohn Ephrussi wed a Pressburger-Todesco Porges of Vienna, descendant of Samson Wertheim, in 1856. And as his niece and daughter-in-law wed a Catholic French noble in 1857, Abraham Rafalovich became an honored hereditary citizen of Russia. Since marrying into the shipbuilding Warshavsky family in the 1840s, the Poltava First Guild tax farmer Portugalovs kinterlinked with Rubinstein agricultural family of Kharkov in 1857. And in Warsaw, Wilhelm Lando, of a likely but unknown Landau relation, opened a bank. \nIn 1857, Alex II ended the cantonist kidnapping of Jewish boys. Likewise, Russia began mining Alaska. But as grain prices deflated after unsold Russian wheat flooded the market, the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic> struck America and soon spread globally<italic>.</italic> In April of that year <italic>Fould Oppenheim </italic>reinforced alliances. As a Katz-cousin Fould wed a Pereire, an <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne heiress married Polish Saxon banker Felix Frankel Kaskele of Dresden.\nIn the first great railroad mobilization, Napoleon III transported troops to Austrian Italy in the <italic>Franco-Austrian War of 1859</italic>. Austrian tactics, designed for precision rifles, faced challenges with mainly Slavic conscripts and commands issued only in German. As Prussia sought to aid Austria, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> and <italic>Berliner </italic>organized financing until logistical issues hindered mobilization. Surrendering in July 1859, Emperor Franz Joseph ceded of Lombardy to French Piedmont, leaving Austria buried in debt. The collapse of Austrian <italic>thalers</italic> led to the bankruptcy of <italic>Arnstein Eskeles</italic>. \nWithin a year, Victor Wimpffen, a noble Christian descendant of Katz, Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, Samson Wertheim, and Bernhard Eskeles, wed Anastasia Ghica Sina. As Austria\u2019s <italic>Director-General of Posts & Telegraphs</italic>, Wimpffen allowed women to become postmistresses, personally recruiting them, before Anastasia divorced him and reclaimed her wealth. Her sisters\u2019 husbands squandered their doweries. \nLike <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> in Cologne, an early French imitator of Pereires\u2019 <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> was his fellow Bordeaux Sephardi. Having bought a railway-focused newspaper in 1848, Jules Mir\u00e8s expanded into gas distribution and established an investment trust in 1850 that he reorged into <italic>Railway Fund</italic> in 1853. As Mir\u00e8s secured contracts to develop ports and gas PUs in Marseilles, he obtained railway concessions in the Papal States and formed <italic>Roma</italic> RR with Roman nobles and raised <italic>Railway Fund</italic>\u2019s capital by 1856.\nSince 1859, Mir\u00e8s successfully competed with <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris for underwriting a Spanish loan. That year, he his <italic>Caisse Generale</italic> collaborated with Roman nobles\u2014with a Papal charter to build railway lines from Rome to Civitavecchia and to Ancona and Bologna\u2014to form <italic>Roma</italic> RR. By 1860, he was arrested while issuing a loan to the Turkish government, participating a market crisis. As his daughter married Prince Polignac, he was sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment for fraud before having the verdict set aside in 1862 in a new trial that was marked by bribery and public intrigue. \nMeanwhile, Austrian Habsburg Emperor Franz transferred control of <italic>Tyrol, Carinthia, & Vienna-Trieste</italic> RR in the Austro-Italian Alps to a syndicate including <italic>Rothschild</italic>, Genoese <italic>Ferrari</italic>, <italic>Lafitte Blount</italic>, and <italic>Talbot</italic>, in 1858. Following Mir\u00e8s\u2019 failure, <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> took over his <italic>Roma</italic> RR in central Italy and sought to create an integrated system. \nFor the southern portion, the bank submitted bids as the Bourbon King of Naples ordered the construction of three major lines connecting Naples to Brindisi, Taranto, and Reggio, and three lines linking Palermo to other Sicilian cities in 1860. That year, as Giuseppe Garibaldi secured loans to support his campaign to conquer Sicily from Genoese Adriano Lemmi and his brother-in-law Pietro Adami, Tuscany\u2019s former Minister of Finance. Following his successful conquest, Garibaldi gave Adami a concession to build railroads across the South and a tobacco monopoly.\nFollowing Italy\u2019s unification in 1861, Tuscan banker Pietro Bastogi became the Minister of Finance and signed laws consolidating the public debts of the newly formed state into <italic>Bank of Tuscany</italic>. With Adami\u2019s finances challenged, While the latter bankers failed to secure financing, and Bastogi granted the  concession for the south network to <italic>Talabot</italic> in May 1861. While <italic>Talabot</italic> requested a loan, the government\u2019s rejection led him to withdrew.  To continue the works and protect popular confidence in the government, Bastogi partnered with <italic>Rothschild</italic> and <italic>Ferrari</italic>. By 1863, <italic>Adami</italic> sold his concession to the syndicate\u2019s <italic>Lafitte</italic><italic> </italic>ally. \nWith the <italic>Liberation Wars</italic> since Napoleon, abolitionist princes slowly gave way to Imperial centralization, emancipation, and assimilation. But that is just one definition. While Venetian Court Jew Abraham Camondo competed with <italic>Rothschild</italic>, he faced a greater threat from local Jewish authorities. After Camondo established Constantinople\u2019s first multi-lingual Jewish school in 1858, opposing rabbis called for withdrawal and accusing it of spreading Christianity. Facing excommunication, Camondo had the rabbi arrested. The Jewish community rallied, meeting the Sultan, who released the rabbi upon apology to Camondo.\nAt the time, Karl Marx\u2014whose Katz-descendant father had converted to retain his government post\u2014argued that <italic>Fould</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, and <italic>Stiglitz</italic> monopolized lending of the French, Austrian, and Russian empires. While Marx ignored the intense competition and the conversions of Fould and Stiglitz, he liked his banker relatives, including his converted Mendelssohn cousins for their cultural achievements. To retain his government post, Karl\u2019s father converted. \nLike Karl, his extended cousin and fellow convert, exiled in Paris poet Heinrich Heine\u2014whose family served as the Court Jews of B\u00fcckeburg and kinterlinked with fellow converts Mendelssohn, Stiglitz, and Fould\u2014struggled financially and romantically. Heine\u2019s engagement with German philosopher Goethe and perspective on religion influenced composer Richard Wagner and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s \u2018God is dead\u2019 concept.\nSince the formation of <italic>Grande Soci\u00e9t\u00e9</italic>, Russia encouraged the creation of 75 joint-stock companies, raising over 140 million rubles, despite initial foreign stock offerings falling short due to <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>. To stimulate domestic investment, Russia lowered interest rates on deposits in state credit institutions and loans to utilize idle capital, ease debt service from the war, and reduce government spending. With the new interest rates was positive, the Russian public supported the joint-stock ventures. \nWhen their mother Maria died in 1858, the Russian Orthodox Eliseev brothers founded <italic>Eliseev </italic>trading. Grigori Eliseev soon married his daughter to Grig Rasteriaev. Since Grig\u2019s tanner father died in 1860, his mother led and grew the business until her death, when Grig took over in 1874. Likewise, Katz-cousins Gunzburg and Lazard blossomed as more Jews moved to Paris. By 1858, two Lazard brothers returned to France from California to start <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris. Likewise, Gabriel Gunzburg moved to Paris, where he later established <italic>Gunzburg </italic>Paris. As a Katz-Brodsky son branched to Odessa that year, <italic>Brodsky</italic> grew as Russia\u2019s largest sugar producer. \nThrough 1858, however, investors ran to Russia\u2019s 5% government-guaranteed stocks from state credit institutions. This mass withdrawal placed these institutions at risk of insolvency, compelling the government to address the issue urgently. As a result, when reform legislation was drafted in 1859, it had to contend with a backdrop of mounting state debt, inflation, unfavorable foreign loan conditions, and the inability to restore ruble convertibility. The banking crisis forced a reordering of fiscal priorities, preventing subsidies for serfs\u2019 land acquisition and burdening peasants with high interest rates on their redemption debts. This, in turn, led to a shift towards gradual rather than immediate redemption and imposed credit restrictions.\nFrom 1859, Russia unlinked Court Banker Alex Stiglitz\u2019s <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Commercial Bank</italic> monopoly. Chairing the Saint-<italic>Petersburg Stock Exchange Committee</italic> since 1846, Stiglitz liquidated his private bank and <italic>Committee</italic> chair, dedicating himself to state activities. By Imperial decree, <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>Commercial Bank</italic> transformed into <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>State Bank</italic> under Stiglitz.\nAs Jews left the <italic>Pale</italic>, Warshavsky moved Poltava for Saint-Petersburg. So did Gabriel Gunzburg and Abram Zak from Podolia, where they established <italic>Gunzburg</italic> Saint-Petersburg in 1859. By 1861, <italic>Rafalovich</italic> bought a noble estate in Bessarabia and established a sugar refinery. That year, Kiew allowed Jews with five years as first-guild merchants to settle. As Brodskys, Gunzburgs, and Zaitsevs settled, local resistance led police to order Jews to leave within a week in 1863. But the expulsion failed, with 8,000 Jews living in Kiew by 1865. \nDespite emancipation and wealth, oppression continued. While Herman Rafalovich moved to Paris with his family in 1863, his brother remained in Odessa and converted as Christianity became practically compulsory for his profession. Likewise, Serbia emancipated Jews as 78-year-old Pasha Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 returned to power. However, he died in a year, and his son resumed religious oppression and Jewish expulsions.\nLike the Jewish<italic> </italic>Gunzburg and Russian Orthodox Eliseev, Russia\u2019s other dynastic bankers were religious community leaders. While the Eliseev of the dominant Russian Orthodox faith, most serfs in Russia\u2019s interior were Old Believers. Along with ending tax farming in favor of free banking in 1860, Russia eased Old Believer laws, and serf descendant Savva Morozov founded <italic>Morozov</italic> trading house. While Savva soon died, his heirs joined co-religionists, nobles, <italic>Stiglitz</italic>, <italic>Gunzburg</italic>, and <italic>Kronenberg</italic> to found <italic>Moscow Merchant Bank</italic>. \nWhile Old Believers advocated for serf rights, Kokorev\u2019s <italic>Volga-Kama Bank</italic> soon dominated Russian banking to distribute Baku kerosene across the Caspian, Kokorev and his co-religionist textile manufactures led <italic>Moscow Merchant </italic>was second. Likewise, Kokorev drafted a modern excise system to regulate the spirit trade and replace the 16th century alcohol monopoly and the tax farm financial system, which Russia implemented by 1863. As textile industrialists led Moscow\u2019s Old Believer banks, bankers led Jewish banks in Saint-Petersburg and in the <italic>Pale</italic>. While the former established industries eschewed speculation for stability, the latter embraced a dynamic, speculative <italic>Mobilier</italic><italic></italic><italic></italic><italic></italic>-like approach, forging closer government ties and distributing calculated risks.\nFinally, Russia emancipated sixty million serfs in March 1861 as part of a modernization process. As part of the emancipation, Russia prevented free mining per the Ural iron cartel.<italic> </italic>As Orthodox and Old Believer bankers\u2014including Vonlyarlyarsky, Kokorev, and Morozov\u2014joined forces against the <italic>Grande Soci\u00e9t\u00e9</italic> syndicate, arguing that Russian state-backed entrepreneurs could construct railways more economically and patriotically than Jewish foreigners. \nAmidst allegations of incompetence and capital waste in Russia, the <italic>Mobilier</italic>-affiliated railway only progressed along <italic>Saint-Petersburg-Warsaw</italic> RR. So, they requested more guaranteed capital and construction subsidies. But days after Russia emancipated the serfs, uprisings spread in Warsaw and elsewhere Russian Poland, demanding modernization and Jewish emancipation. While Russia brutally suppressed the rebellion, <italic>Rothschild</italic> refused to refinance Russian debt until April as Poland began modernizing. \nIn July, Russia removed the directors of the <italic>Mobilier</italic>-affiliated railway and transferred management to Saint-Petersburg. So, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Baring</italic>, and <italic>Hope</italic> provided more funds within a month. Similarly, the Tsar chartered <italic>English </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Russian Bank</italic>, with funding from <italic>Robarts</italic> <italic>Lubbock</italic> and <italic>Ricardo</italic>, an Anglo-Dutch Sephardi family kinterlinked with Goldsmid cousin Keysers, as well as Christian bankers. \nMoreover, entrepreneurs\u2014including Britons but mainly <italic>Pale</italic> Jews\u2014began industrializing South and East Ukraine. By 1861, after managing coal supply contracts, Samuel Polyakov presented himself before <italic>Moscow-Yaroslav</italic> RR management seeking a rail transport contract. His success led to his meeting Count Ivan Tolstoy. While Samuel earned contracts to supply Ukrainian coal to Moscow\u2019s waterworks and build roads, Iakov left Jewish studies to manage a cloth mill factory and alcohol distillery in Voronezh for the Count in 1865. Iakov\u2019s wife Amalia took charge of their family business in Orsha while he was away. Similarly, the third brother, Lazar, married iron trader\u2019s daughter Rosalia Vydrin and listened to her advice. \nFrom 1859, merchant-registered Jews received the right to reside outside the <italic>Pale</italic>. In 1861, Jews with university degrees were granted unrestricted residence rights throughout Russia. Since Latvian Riga allowed Jews to purchase property in 1858, Jews and other ethnic groups gained the right to establish banks in Riga from 1862. Soon after, Riga abolished restrictive guilds and removed business and trade barriers. \nAlthough the German Junker elite\u2014such as the Korff and Benckendorf families\u2014continued to dominate Riga\u2019s banks and held large tracts of forested estates, reforms in the 1860s allowed peasants and Jews to begin acquiring and leasing land. This opened the door for emerging timber interests\u2014often Jewish or peasant-backed\u2014to aggregate parcels for extraction and trade, gradually challenging the Junkers\u2019 economic monopoly and accelerating the region\u2019s commercial transformation. From wool guilds and local manufacturing, <italic>Schepeler</italic> expanded into capital-intensive sectors like rail, utilities, markets, and textiles. \nSince 1860, Warsaw\u2019s <italic>Kronenberg</italic>, many of whom converted to Calvinism, kinterlinked with a Parisian banker Oppenheim, of unknown lineage, and <italic>Toeplitz</italic>\u2019s Jan Bloch in 1862. Since the Bloch brothers\u2014third great-grandsons of Katz-descendant Zevi Ashkenasy and cousins of the Hamburger and Goldschmidt families\u2014converted to Catholicism and joined <italic>Toeplitz</italic> before overseeing the extension of <italic>Saint-Petersburg-Warsaw</italic> RR in 1857. While his brother moved to Vienna in 1860, Jan remained in Poland. And in 1862, Alex Laski\u2014a step-grandson of Samuel Frankel, great grandson of Szmul Zbytkower, cousin of the Saxon Kaskele bankers, and second cousin of Henyrk Toeplitz\u2014became President of <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland</italic>. \nHowever, his term did not last long as the Polish Uprising of 1863 raged. Amidst the crisis, Leo Kronenberg played a crucial role as a financial supporter of the National Government in Warsaw. He also served as a key negotiator with Russian authorities and was influential in maintaining civic order as a member of the City Delegation. His efforts were pivotal in both financing the rebellion and navigating the political complexities of the period. \nAfter the Uprising of 1863, the Russian government limited the involvement of Polish Catholics in the military and civic positions in Poland and Western Russia and Russified <italic>Bank </italic><italic>of Poland </italic>for funding the Uprising, gradually transforming into <italic>State Bank </italic>FX office. With restrictive Russian banking law, Poles could only participate in advisory committees. Herman Epshteyn\u2019s family were actively involved in Uprising. While one nephew was killed, another was imprisoned for a year in Siberia. Herman\u2019s son was initially sentenced to death, it was later commuted to banishment to Siberia until 1870.\nBecause of the Polish Uprising, Russia curtailed Ukrainian-language publishing and debated a southern railroad linking Moscow with the Black Sea via Kiew and Odessa. The pro-commerce side proposed private financing, but French pressure blocked <italic>Rothschild</italic> loans and the British financing failed. Construction began on <italic>Ode</italic><italic>s</italic><italic>sa\u2013Balta</italic> RR using army labor, and Baltic German entrepreneurs, connected to German banks, later took over.\nMeanwhile, <italic>Gunzburg</italic> gained <italic>Stiglitz</italic>\u2019s customers, becoming the Saint-Petersburg agent for <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>, <italic>Warschauer</italic>, and others. By 1862, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Royal Bank of W\u00fcrtemberg</italic>, and <italic>Gunzburg</italic> collaborated on managing the Russian state loan. After Baron Stiglitz retired as Director of <italic>Imperial</italic> <italic>State Bank</italic> in 1866\u2014remaining under the Ministry of Finance in the credit department\u2014he was followed by Evgenii Lamanski, a Christian who joined the boards of most large Russian banks and railroads until the 1880s. Although not wealthy before, he became so by connecting the state and enterprise. \nAs <italic>Warburg</italic> of Hamburg sent their sons to woo Russian bankers, Siegmund Warburg married Theophile Gunzburg Rosenberg, the daughter of Katz-cousin Hessel Rosenberg, who became a Saint-Petersburg guild merchant and Ukrainian forest magnate. Likewise, Theophile\u2019s sister married her cousin Horace Gunzburg, whose sister wed Katz-cousin Paul Fould in Paris. By 1864, their Warburg brother Moritz married Katz-cousin Charlotte Goldschmidt Oppenheim, a Frankfurt diamond dealer\u2019s daughter, whom their son Felix first apprenticed under. Soon after, Warburg connected Melchiors kinterlinked with Bloch\u2019s Katz descendant second cousin. And a Swedish Warburg cousin wed Emma Rapha\u00ebl of the Anglo-Dutch gold refiners.\nWhile beginning to limit freedom of the press through censorship, Russia reassessed the role of minorities, especially with the end of serfdom in the countryside. While laws allowed Jews who were First Guild merchants, university graduates, and skilled artisans to exit the <italic>Pale</italic> and live anywhere in the Empire, others were prohibited from acquiring, renting, or managing lands in northeast and southwest. Among the first Russian Jews to migrate to Poland, David Szereszowski of Brest, a Katz and Meisel descendant whose third cousin was the Dynin who wed Joseph Gunzburg, started a private bank in Warsaw to discount bills.\nCommerce in Russian Finland also liberalized.  Since 1851, the Finnish government required foreigners, except Russian nobles, to obtain tsarist permission to own land, authorities faced growing pressure to secure Finland\u2019s financial autonomy, which intensified after the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic> and led to the Russian Tsar introducing the <italic>markka</italic> for <italic>Bank of Finland</italic> in 1860, equal to the French <italic>franc</italic> and one-fourth of a <italic>ruble</italic>. The government lifted the ban on steam-powered sawmills in 1861, and in 1862 entrepreneurs founded <italic>Union Bank of Finland</italic>\u2014the country\u2019s first commercial bank\u2014and department store <italic>Stockmann</italic>. Soon after, Norwegian investors, backed by British, French, Belgian, and German capital, built sawmills, including Hans Gutzeit\u2019s mill at Kotka.\nThe famines of the Russian blockades during the <italic>Crimean War</italic> and success of the <italic>Franco-Austrian War of 1859</italic> led to the unification of Piedmont, Naples, the Papal States, and other countries into Italy under King Victor Habsburg Savoy of Piedmont in 1861, while France absorbed Piedmontite Nice. Other unifications included America (1861), China (1863), Poland (1863), Rio de la Plata (1864), Denmark (1864), Germany (1866), and Mexico (1867). \nWhile <italic>Erlanger </italic>and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> marketed bonds for Confederates, Sweden sought to issue a loan in Frankfurt to finance railways but faced backlash for supporting Denmark against Prussia. Along with Frankfurt and Paris, <italic>Erlanger</italic> raised the loan in London with <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> in 1864, for which Emile Erlanger received a Swedish barony. The same year, <italic>Erlanger</italic> and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> arranged a loan for Tunisia. \nAfter Italy superseded the Papal States, Catholic banker Edward Blount of <italic>Blount Laffitte</italic> arranged the debt conversion. However, with Italy assuming control of the Papal territories, the Vatican defaulting on her 1850 <italic>Rothschild</italic> loan. And as Italy absorbed Naples, <italic>Rothschilds</italic> Naples dissolved in favor of the autonomous <italic>Banco di Napoli</italic> in 1863, retaining only representative offices in Rome and Turin. Instead, Pereire and Ferarri gained control of Rothschild\u2019s <italic>Bank of Commerce & Industry of Turin</italic> in Piedmont, renaming it <italic>Credito Mobiliare</italic>, and growing her operations with the new railroad connections. \nThe same day of the reorg <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> founded rival <italic>Banca di Credito.</italic> Likewise, <italic>Thomson Bonar</italic>\u2019s William Gladstone, <italic>Robarts</italic> <italic>Lubbock</italic>, and <italic>Leonino</italic> co-founded<italic> Banca Anglo-Italiana</italic> in London to strengthen credit relations. While Italian Jew Ippolito Leonino (and Cohen-Barent Montefiore in-law) managed <italic>Leonino</italic>, his nephew married in 1864, Katz-cousin Am\u00e9lie Oppenheim of Hamburg related to Court Jews Samuel Oppenheim, Samson Wertheim, and Michael Speyer. Likewise, Sabino Leonino joined the board <italic>Sardinia </italic>RR, followed by an appointment as auditor of <italic>Southern Italian </italic>RR. After publicly listing in 1870, the new <italic>Bank of Genoa</italic> soon branched to Argentina. \nSince electing Sir Raffaele Luzzatto, Baron Giuseppe Morpurgo, and five other Jewish city counselors as Deputies to the Vienna Parliament in 1861, Italy ennobled many Jewish bankers, including Vittorio Reinach, Abram Leonino, Sebastiano Mondolfo, and Giacomo Castelnuovo received noble titles for their specific achievements. Mondolfo, ennobled in 1864, founded construction companies vital for <italic>Austria</italic><italic> </italic>RR\u2019s Lombardo-Venetian segment, despite initially being an Austrian citizen. Castelnuovo and Giorgio Levi were recognized for their contributions to Italian society. However, banks remained family partnerships and <italic>Avigador</italic> went bankrupt in 1875 after several family deaths.\n<italic>Weill Schott</italic> banked politician Francesco Crispi via <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Brussels. But Italian banking remained fragmented, hindering development. Having closed <italic>Rothschild</italic> Naples in 1863, <italic>Rothschild</italic> hired <italic>Schott Weill\u2019</italic>s uncle to manage her Naples office from 1867. The same year, <italic>Schott Weill</italic> branched to Florence, as their sister married Enrico Guastalla, a Jewish soldier under Garibaldi and later a politician who cemented ties with Francesco Crispi and led the branch.\nSoon, <italic>Rafalovich</italic> and his in-laws\u2014<italic>Ephrussi</italic> and <italic>Ashkenasy</italic>\u2014replaced the Anglo-Greek traders in Odessa, industrialization stimulated grain elevators and grain exporters. The Zbytkowers connected the Kallier to the Toeplitz family of Warsaw as well as to Ignacy Rozenthal, who wed a Rappaport cousin of Brody and began to freight-forward among Galicia, Russian Poland, and Germany.\nSince<italic> </italic><italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris hired Katz-descendant Horace Landau\u2014a cousin-in-law of the Ephrussi and Kallir families\u2014to originate loans across the Black Sea, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna chose Abraham Mises to <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Lemberg from 1860. A grandson and great-grandson of well-known traders of Lemberg, Mises married a Katz-descendant Halberstam, related to the Kallirs and Landaus. And since Leo Dreyfu\u00df\u2014whose extended cousin Isaac Dreyfu\u00df had founded <italic>Dreyfu\u00df</italic> Basel in 1812\u2014founded grain trader<italic> Louis-Dreyfu\u00df</italic> in Paris in 1850, he wed Emilie Aron Lang\u2014a third cousin once removed of Esther Cerf Aron Lazard\u2014in 1860.\nWhile from Frankfurt like the founders of <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Brussels and <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne, who  are known to be extended cousins of Samuel Oppenheim and of one another, their relation to Simon Oppenhym is unknown. Oppenhym relocated to London, where he established the banking house <italic>Oppenhym</italic> London in 1850. Simon\u2019s brother Hermann became a partner in <italic>Alberti</italic> <italic>Pinto Oppenhym</italic> in Paris and <italic>Oppenhym Alberti</italic> in Constantinople and founded <italic>Oppenhym </italic>in Alexandria in the early 1860s.\nThe financial crisis in Constantinople began in early 1861 following the failure of the Mir\u00e8s loan issued in late 1860. Local bankers, burdened with debts from the <italic>Crimean War</italic>, heavily relied on short-term credit from European houses. Despite efforts by the Ottoman government to secure loans abroad, confidence in Ottoman finances remained low in European markets. Consequently, the crisis led to liquidity shortages among local bankers, bankruptcies of major Chiot banker cousin-in-laws houses like <italic>Rodocanachi</italic>, <italic>Baltazzi</italic>, and <italic>Psychari</italic>, and the near-collapse of the British <italic>Ottoman</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>. Additionally, Greek mercantile houses in London, engaged in trade with Constantinople, faced substantial setbacks due to the crisis. \nWhile Egypt selected an Anglo-German syndicate including <italic>Fr\u00fchling G\u00f6schen</italic>, <italic>Sulzbach</italic>, <italic>Erlanger</italic>,<italic> Bethmann</italic>,<italic> Oppenhym Alberti</italic>, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, and <italic>K\u00f6nigswarter</italic>, <italic>Haber</italic>, and <italic>J\u00e4ger</italic> to arrange her first European state loan in 1862, the syndicate enlarged to add French interests, including <italic>Mobilier</italic><italic></italic><italic></italic><italic></italic>, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Stern</italic>, and several others. Likewise, <italic>Ottoman</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>,<italic> Glyn</italic>, <italic>International Financial Society\u2014</italic>including <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Stern</italic>, <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen</italic>, <italic>Sulzbach</italic>, <italic>Pereire,</italic> <italic>Oppenh</italic><italic>y</italic><italic>m</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Alberti</italic>\u2014, <italic>Camondo</italic>, <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>, <italic>Ralli</italic>, <italic>Baltazzi</italic>, and <italic>Zafiropoulo Zarifi</italic>, and other investors into <italic>TURK</italic> in 1863 to monopolize and centralize paper money and trade credit and build <italic>Suez Canal</italic>. \nLeading the Paris and London committees for decades were Charles Mallet and <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s Charles Mills. Likewise, the Jewish and Christian partners kinterlinked via Frederick Dernburg. The son of a Jewish father converted to Christianity after facing antisemitism, wed a <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Brussels, and <italic>Schott Weill</italic><italic> </italic>cousin Reinach, and served as a Privy Counsellor, Dernburg married cousins of <italic>Metzler </italic>and<italic> </italic><italic>Bethmann</italic>.\n<italic>TURK</italic>\u2019s monopoly did not extend to land. Since civil servant Pasha Midhat put down disorder and banditry in the Balkans during the <italic>Crimean War</italic>, he gained the support of reformist Tanzimat bureaucrats to create the agricultural bank <italic>Credit Funds</italic> in 1863 in the sancak of Nis and soon expanded across the empire. Relying on Europeans, <italic>TURK</italic> not appointed local Christians to senior management, employing a few Jews and no Muslims beyond interpreters or subordinate roles. While <italic>TURK</italic> established a branch in the Jewish metropolis of Turkish Salonica on the border with Greece, the crowded-out Greek grain traders moved to ports beyond the <italic>Pale</italic> and, following consolidation, tapped London\u2019s MMBU via <italic>TURK</italic>. \nFacing hostility from Galata bankers whose dealings were threatened, <italic>TURK</italic> sought to end the conflict by involving select houses in her business. In 1864, she founded <italic>l\u2019Empire Ottoman</italic> with <italic>Baltazzi</italic>, <italic>Camondo</italic>, <italic>Stefanovitch</italic>, <italic>Ralli</italic>, <italic>Zographos</italic>, <italic>Missiroglu</italic>, <italic>Zafiropoulos Zarifi</italic>, and <italic>Oppenhym Alberti</italic>\u2014in Constantinople and London. <italic>TURK</italic> and <italic>l\u2019Empire </italic>agreed to share 50% of state-related business and circulate the bank\u2019s notes. That year, Baltazzi\u2019s cousin-in-law married a Ghica Sina heiress and <italic>Sulzbach</italic> kinterlinked with <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>-funded<italic> Premsel</italic> of Paris and Hamburg. \nAs<italic> </italic><italic>Ralli</italic>, <italic>Rodocanachi,</italic> <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>, and <italic>Stern</italic> invested in the new <italic>Imperial Bank</italic><italic> </italic>in London,<italic> Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s Julius Blum opened offices in Egypt and Trieste in 1864. Likewise, a <italic>Rodocanachi</italic> cousin partnered with <italic>General Credit & Finance Co</italic>-funded<italic> Agra Masterman </italic>to launch <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic>, to compete with the Anglo-Greek <italic>Egyptian Bank</italic>. Under British laws, which were less restrictive than those in France, <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> relied on French capital through <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Agricole</italic>, <italic>Pastr\u00e9</italic> of Marseilles, and Greek <italic>Sinadino</italic> in Egypt. The collapse of <italic>Agra Masterman </italic>in the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic> led <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> to ally with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic>. \n\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Early American Panics & Free Labor</italic><italic> </italic>\nWhile Quaker Philadelphia\u2019s governance was often under external control, Puritan Bostonians had a tradition of self-rule. This distinction is evident in the Quaker ethic of tolerance in Philadelphia, which some saw as indifference, leading even wealthy Quakers to dissent within their colony. Quaker merchants in Philadelphia focused on the Atlantic triangular trade, while Boston\u2019s merchants explored China and other global markets. This contrast in ideals shaped their social hierarchies. For instance, prominent Philadelphia Quakers, like the Biddle, Cadwaladr, and Morris, families influenced the region while Boston Brahmins, such as the Adams, Cabot, and Lowell, played a central role in their lands.\nThese differing values extended to their universities. Boston Brahmins continued supporting <italic>Harvard</italic> since Massachusetts\u2019 Court chartered in 1636. But Philadelphia offered limited support after Boston-born Benjamin Franklin\u2014whose wife was a cousin-in-law of Reverend Thomas Hooker and the Perry Lane family\u2014and the Quaker Shippen family of Philadelphia\u2019s first mayor co-founded <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> in 1740. This disparity is evident in various aspects, such as naming origins (<italic>Harvard</italic> after an obscure graduate of <italic>Emmanuel College</italic>, and <italic>Penn</italic>\u2019s consideration of naming her in honor of Franklin), campus development, and faculty prestige. Whereas <italic>Harvard</italic> faculty always enjoyed prestige in Boston, and many were members of the Boston Brahmin, this has less true of <italic>Penn</italic>\u2019s faculty in Philadelphia. \nLikewise, the Knickerbockers, descendants of Dutch settlers, held sway over New York\u2019s elite. They helped develop <italic>Columbia </italic>College, studying medicine and law. However, they were less involved in the university than the Brahmins. More than the English, the Knickerbockers formed around Dutch feudalism. Soon after colonizing the region between Delaware and New York in 1624, <italic>Dutch West Indies Co</italic> (\u201cGWC\u201d) introduced the patroonship system in 1629, granting hereditary estates to investors. \nPatroon Kiliaen Rensselaer, a court jeweler who co-founded GWC, acquired the modern Albany and Rensselaer counties, which he managed from Holland. Other patroonships failed\u2014<italic>Pavonia</italic> was sold back to GWC, and <italic>Swanendael</italic> was destroyed in 1632. Patroons frequently clashed with GWC over trade, particularly in furs. By 1634, most patroons had been bought out, except Rensselaer, whose estate survived even after English control of the region in 1664.\nAs the junction of the Hudson River and Lake Erie, Albany enabled trade between the Atlantic Ocean and the Great Lakes. While the Rensselaer continued to marry their Cortlandt cousins\u2014who traced their lineage to the Dukes of Courland, with the first in America being a GWC soldier\u2014both soon kinterlinked with fellow GWC merchant families Schuyler and Schaack, who acquired large estates. Another prominent Knickerbocker was Claes Roosevelt, who arrived in New Amsterdam in 1648. Claes bought dozens of acres within a few years Still, the families faced competition as England took over North America. \nA third cousin of British <italic>Civil War</italic> leader Colonel David Barclay, Calvinist Reverend John Livingston fled Scottish persecution in 1663 for Rotterdam. His sons William, James, and Robert, followed and became merchants, as their brother-in-law served as a factor for Scottish merchants and landowners. After Robert emigrated to Albany in 1674, he married Alida Schuyler, the Patroon\u2019s widowed daughter-in-law, in 1679, and secured a 160,000-acre Hudson Valley royal land grant in 1686. \nWhile William and James returned to Scotland after the <italic>Glorious Revolution of 1689</italic> and joined the failed <italic>Scottish</italic> <italic>Trading Co</italic> in 1698, Robert\u2019s fleet traded timber, grain, furs, sugar, tobacco, and slaves, linking New York, Virginia, Barbados, and Madagascar. His son, Philip, expanded the family\u2019s enterprises in the 1730s, becoming a leading slave importer and trading Newfoundland cod for Madeira wine. By the 1740s, the Livingstons expanded into Portugal and Spain.\nThe Sands and Jones families became the original settlers of Long Island. Since his Welsh-born father condemned King Charles to death in 1649 and married Oliver Cromwell\u2019s sister, William Jones fled to New Haven after the King Charles II executed his father upon the restoration of the monarchy. William later married the daughter of the first Governor of the New Haven and Connecticut Colonies. Becoming Deputy Governor himself until 1698, he formed a judicial dynasty that led New York for decades. While Thomas Jones served as High Sheriff and Justice of the Peace for Queens by 1700, his son David served as Judge of Queens in 1734 and the second Justice of New York\u2019s Court from 1763. \nBy 1685, Scot Quaker Robert Gordon Barclay became a proprietor and Governor of East New Jersey. While Robert\u2019s English descendants kinterlinked with Quaker goldsmith <italic>Freame</italic> of London (the forerunner to <italic>Barclay</italic> bank) in 1707, his brother John represented the family in America. But the Dutch religious freedoms allowed inter-marriage. After serving as a missionary, John Barclay\u2019s son Thomas became the Anglican Minister of Albany and married the daughter of a Dutch Admiral and a Schaack in 1709. After Sarah Roosevelt married fellow a Knickerbocker, Schaack-cousin Phil Schuyler in 1718, her niece Helena wed Thomas Barclay\u2019s son in 1737. Another of Thomas\u2019 sons wed a Schaack cousin in 1771. As the Livingston and Roosevelt families kinterlinked with descendants of Emperor Charlemagne, their children shared a heritage with the Barclays.\nLikewise, Anne Schuyler Cortlandt married Stephen DeLancey in 1700. Born in Normandy to a noble Huguenot family, DeLancey fled France after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, he escaped to Holland and later to England, where he was naturalized. Arriving in New York in 1686, became a successful merchant and served as New York City\u2019s Alderman and then a member of the Provincial Assembly. Although DeLancey mostly reshipped Caribbean goods, the Knickerbockers may have relied on him illegal trade with French Canada. While their son Peter married the daughter of New York\u2019s Lieutenant-Governor Cadwalader Colden, his brother James wed the daughter of Colonel Caleb Heathcote, Lord of the Manor of Scarsdale, and became Chief Justice of New York in 1733, Lieutenant-Governor in 1747, and Governor-in-Chief from 1753.\nMore than other states, Huguenots fled to South Carolina after the Revocation, particularly the new city of Charleston. The Huguenot Izard, Laurens, and others kinterlinked with British merchants. Since Thomas Smit served as the first Landgrave of Maryland and owned rice land, one grandson, Josiah, was a Minister, another, Thomas III, became a banker-planter by the 1750s. Thomas III\u2019s brother Benjamin traded rice, Native American goods, and slaves, invested in ships, and was a Speaker of the Commons. \nBenjamin married a daughter of goldsmith banker Robert Brewton, whose other daughter wed Charles Pinckney, and son traded slaves, served in the Commons, and married an Izard. Likewise, Henry DeSaussure\u2014descended from a Lorraine noble who converted to Protestantism in 1551, established Calvinism in Metz, and later moved to Switzerland\u2014settled in South Carolina as a planter in 1731, and his South Carolina-born son Daniel moved to Beaufort in 1767 and led a major commercial operation.\nBy the 1760s, a Roosevelt cousin married fellow Knickerbocker Cornelia Herring, a daughter of a large New York landholder. Cornelia\u2019s sister Margaret married a Jones. Since Thomas Jones served as High Sheriff and Justice of the Peace for Queens in the early 1700s, he became Recorder and Comptroller of New York, and his son became Chancellor of New York State and later served on the state\u2019s Court. Descendants later donated land to form <italic>Jones Beach</italic>. \nSimilarly, the Quaker faith bridged trade between colonies. Anglican Charles Willing, son of prosperous British merchant in Bristol, moved to America in 1727, where he married Anne Shippen, the lapsed Quaker granddaughter of Philadelphia\u2019s first mayor. Owning several ships, Charles organized slaving expeditions in the 1740s. After Charles died, his son Thomas partnered with Anglican Robert Morris, son of a factor from Liverpool, at the start of <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic> from 1754. As <italic>Willing Morris</italic> purchased ships to transport their goods, selling grains and household products in Maryland and Virginia, exporting flour and lumber to Britain, and importing sugar, dry goods, and molasses with credit from <italic>Barclay</italic> London. With the migration of White indentured servants cut off,<italic> Willing Morris</italic> imported more slaves from the West Indies. Thomas Willing soon served as Mayor of Philadelphia and as a justice of the state Court.\nA descendant of early Quakers and a London goldsmith banker, James Bingham married the daughter of the Philadelphia merchant Stamper\u2014Philadelphia\u2019s only carriage owner along with Willing\u2014and ventured into the West Indies rum trade. Likewise, the son of a Bordeaux sea-captain, Stephan Girard began shipping there as a teenager. After suffering significant financial losses during the <italic>Panic of 1772</italic>, Girard did not return to France for fear of imprisonment for unpaid debts. While lapsing in his Catholicism, Girard married a poor Episcopalian shipbuilder\u2019s daughter in 1777, and transferred from sailing to being a commission merchant. \nWhile Girard lacked significant local family ties, Robert Morris had family connections beyond Philadelphia. His daughter married a brother of Chief Justice John Marshall from Virginia, and his sons, including Thomas Morris who represented New York in Congress, played active roles in American politics. Isaac Newton Morris from Illinois and Jonathan David Morris from Ohio also held seats in Congress.\nWith representatives from Cura\u00e7ao to New York and many other cities, Sephardi and Polish rabbinical F\u00fcrst, Franks, Levy, and Gratz families, created a network of unmatched rapid funds transfers. Among these families, the F\u00fcrst family produced Hamburg\u2019s wealthiest Jew during Glickl\u2019s time. The Franks and Levy families took different paths. The Franks family made their way to Hanover, where Aaron Franks gained the trust of Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg George Louis. After Aaron\u2019s son Naphtali moved to London by 1697 and became the \u2018<italic>Jew Broker of London</italic>,\u2019 Aaron lent jewels for the Duke\u2019s coronation as King George I in 1714. \nWhile two of Naphtali\u2019s sons banked in London and marrying into the F\u00fcrst family, a third, Jacob, married Abigail Levy in 1712 and moved to America, where he became the King\u2019s exclusive agent for the Northern Colonies in Philadelphia. Moreover, two of Naphtali\u2019s sons married the daughters of Moses Hart, who funded the <italic>Exchequer</italic> during the <italic>War of the Spanish Succession</italic> and his brother\u2019s rise to be the first Chief Rabbi of Britain. \nJacob later returned to London, but his son David followed in his footsteps and became the King\u2019s agent for Pennsylvania. Amidst the <italic>War of the Austrian</italic><italic> Succession</italic>, David Franks married Margaret Evans, the daughter of Pennsylvania\u2019s land deed recorder and sheriff, who was affiliated with the Christ Church and baptized their children. David\u2019s sister wed American-born Chief Justice of New York James Schuyler, who soon became Lieutenant-Governor. When Madras fell to the French from 1746 to 1749, Aaron Franks\u2019 nephew joined Mordecai Hamburger to help EIC meet financial obligations. \nAlong with buying land, and to a lesser extent, funding slaving ventures, like the Franks, Abigail Levy\u2019s brother Hayman of New York served as the King\u2019s purchasing agent, importer, and real estate investor. Hayman achieved the distinction of being the largest fur trader in the Colonies, employing notables like John Astor. Hayman\u2019s wife was a sister of silversmiths and sister-in-law watchmaker and trader Moses Hays, David Franks\u2019 second cousin and son of a West Indies trader. Hayman also sold goods created out of whales in Newport by Sephardi Jacob Rodriguez Rivera, Moses Lopez, and Aaron Nunes Cardoso. Since moving their snuff mill from Boston to Newport, Rhode Island, Rivera and Lopez manufactured high intensity sperm whale oil candles used by lighthouses and public buildings. Like with British coal, the latter industry cartelized by 1760. \nWith increased opportunities during the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>, Margaret Evans\u2019 sister married the fellow-widowed nephew of David Barclay, head of <italic>Barclay</italic> London, and extended credit to <italic>Willing</italic> of Philadelphia. While David Franks\u2019 son became Attorney General and Chief Justice of the Bahamas, his nephew via Governor James DeLancey married Cornelia Barclay of New York in 1773. Within two years, Cornelia\u2019s brother Reverend Thomas Barclay married a daughter of James DeLancey\u2019s brother Peter and Elizabeth Colden, whose father New York Governor Colden. After another of Peter DeLancey\u2019s daughters wed Ralph Izard of Charleston, South Carolina, Ralph\u2019s cousin married the Duke of Argyll John Campbell\u2019s in 1767. \nPeter DeLancey\u2019s sister, meanwhile, was married to British Royal Navy Admiral Peter Warren. Warren\u2019s nephew, William Johnson, who was born into deposed Irish aristocracy, rose in the Royal Navy following his uncle, and together invested in land with Benjamin Franklin as victory in the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War</italic> opened opportunities for land speculation east of the Mississippi River. Franklin and Johnson claimed 50 million acres for <italic>Illinois </italic><italic>Land </italic><italic>Co</italic>. In 1766, Franklin partnered with the Whartons and London banker Thomas Walpole\u2014a nephew of Robert Walpole and an in-law of the Dutch banker Gerard Neck\u2014to form <italic>Vandalia </italic><italic>Land </italic><italic>Co</italic> to lobby for millions of acres in Ohio. \nWhile Franklin\u2019s daughter married a brother-in-law of Ann Roosevelt Barclay in 1767, Thomas Wharton, son of a Philadelphia Quaker merchant, married Thomas Lloyd\u2019s daughter in 1762 and, with his brothers, acquired 50,000 acres in the Wyoming Valley and 6,000 acres near Lake Otsego in 1768. Aligned with Virginia plantation owning Shippen-in-laws, George Washington, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, acquired land in Maryland, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Virginia through <italic>Mississippi </italic><italic>Land </italic><italic>Co</italic>. Likewise, DeLancey\u2019s Jewish in-law, David Franks led his cousins and collaborated with Christians to purchase vast lands through <italic>Illinois Co</italic>. In 1768, Pennsylvania politician Andrew Allen married Sarah Coxe, whose uncle had married Anne Shippen Willing. In the same year, an Allen cousin married David Franks\u2019 daughter Abigail. In 1771, another Allen sibling married Abigail\u2019s cousin James DeLancey. \nHowever, to pay for the war, Britain also introduced the Stamp Tax, and soon other levies. After the <italic>Panic of 1772</italic>, unsold EIC tea accumulated due to high taxes. While EIC cut dividends as BOE withdrew support, Parliament lowered EIC taxes for her to compete with smuggled Dutch tea. As EIC monopolized tea, Bostonian protest led to punitive law, and soon the <italic>American</italic> <italic>Revolution</italic>. \nSince a Campbell of unknown lineage kinterlinked with Scottish slave trader <italic>Oswald</italic>, a son of <italic>Oswald</italic>\u2019s Charleston partner Henry Laurens, in 1776, married a daughter of a Saint-Kitts planter who settled in London, whose son William Manning, was a West Indies trader and married a Smyth. Likewise, Scottish Campbell cousins <italic>Drummond</italic> reinforced connections with their fellow aristocratic <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic> financers during the <italic>Revolution</italic>, including the Harley family\u2014earls of Oxford and Mortimer\u2014in 1779 and a niece of Elizabeth Compton Drummond, whose brother-in-law married a grandnephew of Robert Walpole, Britain\u2019s first PM.\nAt the start of America\u2019s<italic> Revolution</italic>, New England colonies convened in Rhode Island and agreed to restrict note issuance. While this did not prevent depreciation, Rhode Island notes fared better than the depreciated notes of the national <italic>Continental</italic> <italic>Congress</italic>. Out of the seven presidents of the <italic>Continental Congress</italic>, no less than three were Huguenots: Henry Laurens, who served from 1777 to 1778; John Jay, who served in 1778; and Elias Boudinot, who served from 1779 to 1783. Connected to Huguenot banker Jacques Necker, Frenchman Jacques-Donatien LeRay provided gunpowder. To a greater extent, <italic>Congress</italic> depended on Jewish finance.\nAs Haim Salomon moved to Philadelphia, he began marketing Continental bills for hard Dutch and French currencies. Since Europe carved up his country, Salomon fled Poland for America in 1772, where he married David Franks\u2019 niece Rachel in 1777. Agreeing to his low 0.25% commission, the <italic>Continental Congress</italic> appointed him <italic>Broker to the Office of Finance of the United States</italic>. Soon after, Rachel Franks\u2019 second cousin twice removed, Benjamin Seixas, married Hayman Levy\u2019s daughter. Arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of collaborating, David Franks fled to Britain in 1780.\nCanada did not have any banks through the French defeat in the <italic>Seven Years</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> War</italic>. After serving British General Haldimand\u2019s infantry, Jewish Aaron Hart\u2014likely a grandson of Britain\u2019s Chief Rabbi\u2014married his cousin Dorothy Judah, whose brother was Prothonotary of Three Rivers, Quebec, and niece married Benjamin Seixas\u2019 brother Gershom, and settled in Three Rivers, where he traded fur with Native Americans and the French. Meanwhile, Lazarus David, a British-born Sephardi trader, acquired Montreal landholdings before dying in 1776. While Lazarus\u2019 wife fell on hard times, his son, David, became a prominent fur trader and banker. Despite continual attempts for a bank and customs in British North America, Parliament refused.\nSoon after, the <italic>Continental Congress</italic> and Massachusetts\u2019 General Court issued over 600 letters of marque, authorizing holders to seize British merchant vessels and their cargoes. So, Massachusetts distillery owner John Heard heavily invested in New England privateers, armed merchant vessels commissioned to target British shipping and extended financial support to Ipswich sailors involved in capturing booty. Privateers were especially active against the British cargo shippers of the West Indies.\nAs France attacked the British Bahamas during the <italic>Revolution</italic>, Chief Justice Moses Franks led free and enslaved Blacks in defending the island. In 1781, Dutch banker Jean Neufville facilitated loans to the Continental Congress, while unofficial Dutch-American trade in the Dutch West Indies island of Saint-Eustatius witnessed a rapid ascent due to its strategic location among major colonial powers in the 18th century. As a neutral trade hub, the Free Port attracted merchants and traders from around the world, particularly Jews. \nWhile providing much-needed military provisions and goods to American rebels, the island\u2019s prosperity was short-lived as the British Navy captured Saint-Eustatius. Confiscating property and expelling the Jews, the British ended the Saint-Eustatius community. Intercepting smuggling ships bound for America from Amsterdam, Portugal, and the West Indies, British forces promised land and funds to Black loyalists against the revolution colonies.\nWhile Comfort Sands and William Duer made a fortune from contracting with Robert Morris to supply the Continental army, mercantile Duer and Alex Hamilton built political connections while in the army. From a family connected to <italic>English</italic><italic> Africa Co </italic>(\u201cEAC\u201d), Duer had inherited Dominica estates in 1768, purchased land along the Hudson in New York, became a Royal Navy mast timber contractor, and opened one of America\u2019s first cotton mills in the Bronx. Duer became a mentee of Philip Schuyler\u2014a second cousin once removed of Phil Schuyler, Sara Roosevelt\u2019s husband\u2014who served as General during the Revolution. After Hamilton married Schuyler\u2019s daughter, Duer wed Schuyler\u2019s Livingston second cousin once removed.\nHamilton, the West Indies-born descendant of  Emperor Charlemagne, Scot royalty, and Huguenots, worked for a sugar planter and apprenticed with Knickerbockers before moving to New York to study at <italic>Columbia</italic> and then join the <italic>Revolution</italic>. General George Washington\u2019s grandfather was also a Huguenot who had married into a British family in Virginia. The Sands continued to supply the Army as Comfort Sands\u2019 brother married Philip Schuyler\u2019s widowed mother-in-law in 1779 and Hamilton married Schuyler\u2019s daughter in 1780. Duer also executed Schuyler\u2019s Army contracts. Another of Schuyler\u2019s daughters married the Patroon Rensselaer.\nWith Haim Salomon as his chief agent for Sephardi, Huguenot, Dutch, and Spanish credit, Robert Morris and his partner William Bingham convinced the <italic>Continental Congress</italic> to charter America\u2019s first bank in Quaker Philadelphia in 1781. After Bingham married Thomas Willing\u2019s daughter, Willing became <italic>Bank of North America</italic>\u2019s first President, with Salomon as the largest depositor. Likewise, Morris\u2019 sometimes trader partner Thomas Rusel, a descendant of an original employee of<italic> </italic><italic>Massachusetts Co</italic>, raised funds for <italic>Bank of North America</italic> in Boston. \nTo the Board of<italic> Bank of North America</italic>, Congress appointed Samuel Osgood, an Episcopalian theologian and Massachusetts merchant. By 1784, Osgood became first Cashier for <italic>Massachusetts Bank</italic>, America\u2019s first independent joint-stock bank, founded by Rusel and Boston Brahmin descended from Emperor Charlemagne, including George Higginson Cabot, Stephen Higginson, John Lowell, and Samuel Otis. (After Osgood resigned to join the federal government, Peter Dalton replaced him as Cashier).  \nThe Philadelphia Quakers and Boston Puritans collaborated with Jews in these projects. Born in New York City to Dutch and Portuguese immigrants in 1739, watchmaker-turned-merchant Moses Hays, David Franks\u2019 second cousin and son of a West Indies trader, married Hayman Levy\u2019s sister-in-law in 1766, moving to Massachusetts in 1770s. In 1776, he left Newport and settled in Boston, where he played a vital role in shaping the city\u2019s post-Revolutionary financial and cultural institutions. Moses established a shipping office and was among the first Boston merchants to explore Far East markets. While Moses\u2019 cousin married a DaCosta in 1783, he co-founded <italic>Massachusetts Bank</italic> and found marine and fire insurers with the Boston Brahmin. \nBut the war tested even family bonds. After Benedict Arnold was appointed Military Commander of Philadelphia in 1778, he married a Shippen cousin-in-law of the Willing, Franks, and DeLancey families. As the couple collaborated with a loyalist cousin-in-law of Huguenot banker Jacques Necker, Pennsylvania denounced Arnold for illegal dealings. Meanwhile, Philadelphia-born David Franks served as an officer on Arnold\u2019s staff. Since the British captured Quebec in 1763, Franks moved to Montreal and became a merchant. During the <italic>Revolution</italic>, he supported the American forces in Canada with credit and supplies. When these forces retreated, he fled too. While he fell under suspicion because of Arnold, he was later vindicated and granted land for his services. He later he served as a courier for the government, including being Vice Consul in Marseilles. In 1786, he aided the treaty of peace with Morocco. Later, he associated with <italic>Bank of North America</italic>.\nAs Alex Hamilton wrote the charter for <italic>Bank of New York</italic> (\u201cBONY\u201d) in 1784 and introduced BONY\u2019s first Cashier to <italic>Bank of North America</italic>, his in-law Comfort Sands was one of BONY\u2019s original investors and directors. Hamilton and Knickerbockers John Vanderbilt and Isaac Roosevelt soon became directors. Isaac Roosevelt was a cousin-in-law of Phil Schuyler and brother-in-law of Helena Barclay.\nAlso that in 1784, Sands bought large land plots forfeited by British loyalists and sugar refiner Isaac Roosevelt became the third president of<italic> </italic>BONY by 1786. The same year, Isaac\u2019s son, New York City merchant James,  married former New York Governor James DeLancey\u2019s niece-in-law Maria Walton. While Isaac\u2019s second cousin became interested in the Schuyler copper mines, Isaac\u2019s great-nephew invested in <italic>Associated Manufacturing Iron </italic>with Hamilton, Livingston-in-law John Jay, a Huguenot, and others in 1786, Isaac\u2019s son James later served as President of BONY. \nBenjamin Seixas was one of the Jewish<italic> </italic>BONY shareholders. By 1789, Hayman Levy\u2019s son married Uriah Hendricks\u2019 daughter. Born to Anglo-Dutch Jews known as Henriques before affiliating with Oliver Cromwell, Uriah Hendricks moved to America while his siblings kinterlinked with an Oppenheim, Wagg, and Cohen in London. As Hendricks imported Russian copper and other goods, he soon counted Paul Revere and Robert Fulton as clients. Likewise, Uriah Hendricks married a Sephardi Gomez of Bordeaux, a sister-in-law of Wagg, cousins of Katz, Hart, and Oppenheim families of Britain.\nEnding the war, John Adams of Boston, Benjamin Franklin of Philadelphia Thomas Jefferson of Virginia\u2014all descended from Emperor Charlemagne\u2014and Huguenots Henry Laurens, and John Jay\u2014organized the <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> of 1783. The Treaty agreed to repay colonial debts, several states defaulted on British debts by holding preference for domestic creditors in violation of the customary law. \nSince securing support for Hamilton\u2019s proposed import duty in 1782, Samuel Osgood served as the first UST Commissioner when the <italic>Continental </italic><italic>Congress</italic> organized <italic>United States Treasury </italic>(\u201cUST\u201d) in 1785. Following the <italic>Revolution, </italic>the debts of Southern states accounted for over 80% of debts due to Britain. Unlike the North, Southern states, led by Virginia, owed 83% of American debt to Britain. \nLike slaves were bonded to the agrarian system of tobacco production, planters were bonded to the interwoven mercantilist system of tobacco export. Instead of overturning the remedial <italic>Act of 1732</italic>, several state legislatures reinforced the regime by lowering the shield against estates and replaced primogeniture with partible inheritance to resume credit and reject the English aristocratic ideology. By then, partible inheritance in New England led to labor disputes, shrinking land plots, and slavery abolition. \nAs the <italic>Continental </italic><italic>Congress</italic> debated the <italic>Constitution</italic>, Southerners, led by Charles Brewton Pinckney II of Charleston aligned bankruptcy provisions with commerce for citizens. Involved in canal enterprises and bank boards, these Federalist entrepreneurs earned income from real estate, commercial, and admiralty law, serving Charleston and British merchants in maritime debt matters. However, Virginia planter and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson feared northern creditors using federal law to seize land. As the federal government assumed colonial debts, the <italic>Constitution</italic> gave it a monopoly on impairing contracts and forming treaties. \nBy the time the British occupied South Carolina during the revolution, Daniel DeSaussure fostered relations with the French. After he captured a British transport vessel in 1778, the British briefly imprisoned him. By 1781, he joined Robert Morris\u2019 <italic>Bank of North America</italic> in Philadelphia as teller. After the British evacuated Charlestown, South Carolina, in 1783, DeSaussure and fellow merchants Edward Darrell and Josiah Smit II returned from exile and reentered trade amid. Encouraged by local planters, they formed a new firm\u2014<italic>Smit DeSaussure Darrell</italic>\u2014and arranged to source goods from <italic>Bird Savage</italic> of London. \n<italic>Bird Savage</italic> was founded that year by the Bird brothers, Henry and Robert\u2014nephew-in-laws of Abel Smyth. To strengthen ties with Charleston, the Birds partnered with Benjamin Savage, a son of Charleston merchant John Savage, the son and grandson of Puritan Bermuda-based goldsmiths, was a descendant of Anne Hutchinson, daughter of Reverend Francis Marbury, and a cousin-in-law of Reverend Thomas Hooker through Reverend Thomas Weld. While Henry Bird married a sister of Smyth\u2019s in-law West Indies trader William Manning, the widowed John Savage subsequently married Manning\u2019s aunt. After Thomas Smit III\u2019s daughter married Judge John Grimke, who served as Speaker of the South Carolina Commons and as Justice of the South Carolina Court, in 1784, Charles Pinckney II married <italic>Oswald</italic>\u2019s Charleston partner Henry Laurens\u2019 daughter, a sister-in-law of William Manning, by 1788. Another of Laurens\u2019 daughters married politician David Ramsey, whose Presbyterian Calhoun cousins engaged in farming and politics.\nThe Senate, established in 1787, was crafted to ensure stability and independence. Longer six-year terms than congressmen and staggered elections ensured continuity, with only one-third of the Senate facing re-election every two years. These measures aimed to create a Senate capable of balancing majority will and executive power, likened by President Washington to a saucer cooling tea. \nLess likely than their northern counterparts to be voted up or out, Southern senators gripped the seniority positions over time. Moreover, America\u2019s <italic>Constitution</italic> adopted the judicial review principle that plagued Rhode Island. Since Rhode Island authorized a land bank and mandating creditors accept her bills, creditors avoided contact with debtors until a court case established judicial review and the state repealed the law as the <italic>Constitution</italic> came in force in 1789. \nWith the ratification of the <italic>Constitution</italic>, George Washington became the first President. While appointing UST Commissioner Samuel Osgood to be <italic>Postmaster General</italic>, Washington offered Robert Morris to be UST Secretary, who instead nominated Hamilton for the post. After becoming UST Secretary, Hamilton advised Congress to assume state debts, and founded <italic>First</italic> <italic>Bank of the United States</italic> (\u201cFBUS\u201d) in 1791, with Thomas Willing as the first President (and investment from his son-in-law Bingham). \nAnother director of FBUS, Isaac Wharton, was the Philadelphia Quaker whose brother Thomas married Thomas Lloyd\u2019s daughter in 1762 and speculated in land with Benjamin Franklin after the <italic>Seven Years\u2019 War</italic>. In 1784, their nephew Charles married Abraham Redwood\u2019s granddaughter. That same year, Thomas Wharton died, and Isaac shifted his focus to insurance and invested in <italic>Bank of North America</italic>.\nWhile <italic>Massachusetts Bank</italic> directors funded FBUS <italic>Boston</italic>, which a handful resigned to join as directors alongside Theodore Lyman. As <italic>Massachusetts Bank</italic>\u2019s Peter Dalton became Cashier of FBUS <italic>Boston</italic>, Thomas Rusel became President. Among FBUS\u2019 six remaining branches, Philip Livingston was President of FBUS <italic>New York</italic><italic> </italic>and a husband of his granddaughter, South Carolina-born John Kean, became a cashier of FBUS <italic>Philadelphia</italic>.\n<italic>Smit DeSaussure Darrell</italic> partners led FBUS <italic>Charleston</italic>, including Daniel DeSaussure as President, congressman William Smit as a director, and the latter\u2019s cousin Josiah II as Cashier. As <italic>Smit DeSaussure Darrell</italic> represented London speculators, cousin William Smit also married the daughter of senator Ralph Izard and Stephen DeLancey\u2019s granddaughter, kinterlinking the family with New York and London bankers. In 1792, the Smits invested in <italic>Santee Canal</italic>, <italic>Dismal Swamp Canal Co</italic>, and <italic>Boston Tontines</italic>, and he urged FBUS aid to the branch to counter the newly organized <italic>Bank of South Carolina</italic>. \nWith the organization of federal government, states began chartering banks (\u201cSBs\u201d). Although most American firms were partnerships subject to unlimited liability, FBUS and Britain\u2019s industrial revolution incited a boom in coal mining and related canal and turnpike transport since the North ignored the <italic>Bubbles Act</italic>. Hayman Levy joined Benjamin Seixas other investors to organize <italic>New York Stock Exchange</italic> (\u201cNYSE\u201d) in 1792. Likewise, Rhode Island chartered her first note issuing bank and Philadelphia chartered coal canals. By then, Isaac Roosevelt declined to run for reelection as President of BONY, and his wife\u2019s third cousin once removed was elected in his stead in 1791. \nAlong with purchasing land stakes, William Duer attempted to gain control of BONY by shorting on margin credit, Hamilton curtailed discounts, leading Duer to default and panic to spread. Hamilton supported mercantile credit by buying UST debt and calling banks to collateralize loans. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1792</italic>, Congress passed the  (\u201cDRPA\u201d). While Isaac died in 1794, his cousin once removed James Roosevelt married Maria Schaack in 1793 and soon became involved in banking, And as Albany became New York\u2019s capital, Philip Schuyler Rensselaer served as President of <italic>Bank of Albany</italic><italic> </italic>and a Rensselaer cousin married a Jones by 1802. While Daniel DeSaussure\u2019s son Henry directed America\u2019s <italic>Mint</italic><italic> </italic>in 1794, he resigned to return to South Carolina. To succeed DeSaussure, Washington appointed fellow Huguenot, Elias Boudinot, who formerly presided over the <italic>Continental Congress</italic>.\nMoreover, states and Congress undertook land sales to raise funds. Senator of Pennsylvania since 1789, Robert Morris led land companies to finance land purchases with circulating notes. Like Morris\u2019 Philadelphia Quaker partner Bingham wed his daughter (Willing\u2019s granddaughter) to one of British Baring\u2019s daughters, Quaker Abraham Redwood\u2019s daughter married Huguenot Jean-Conrad Hottinguer, who had fled revolutionary France with his assistant Henri Escher. Together, Baring and Hottinguer\u2014along with his co-religionist <italic>Cazenove</italic> in London, Amsterdam, and America\u2014intermediated European investments from the <italic>French Revolution</italic> and <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> to the relative safety of Morris\u2019 American land scheme. Since parlaying finances from France and Jacques Neckar for the <italic>Revolution</italic>, Frenchman Jacques-Donatien LeRay\u2019s son acquired New York lands and wed Shippen Willing and DeLancey cousin-in-law Grace Coxe in 1789.\u00a0\nIn 1790, Amsterdam banker Pieter Stadnitski, a Polish descendant, began investing in American securities amidst financial uncertainty. By 1792, he co-founded <italic>Holland Land Co</italic> with <italic>Staphorst</italic>, <italic>Eeghen</italic>, <italic>TenCate</italic>, and other bankers in Amsterdam, directing Theophile Cazenove to invest in New York and Pennsylvania lands. Cazenove directed John Lincklaen to find land in Upstate New York for resale to settlers, eventually founding Buffalo, New York. Fluent in French and English, Lincklaen became the chief banker around Utica and what became Cazenovia. For example, he assisted Angel Ferriere, a French colonel who fled the guillotine in 1792 and settled in Madison County, New York. In 1797, John Lincklaen married Helen Ledyard.\nDescended from distant Welsh cousins of the Lloyds, John Ledyard arrived in Connecticut from Bristol. Over the following generations, the family held many high-ranking positions and married into the Jamaica Polhemus and New York Seymour and Forman families, linked with the Duryea. Abraham Duryea married Maria Roosevelt in 1743, who served as a deacon at the Reformed Dutch Church of Flatlands from 1743 onwards. And from Paris, politician Pierre DuPont and Huguenot banker Bidermann raised capital to buy and develop land in western Virginia. By 1795, Bingham succeeded Morris as Pennsylvania\u2019s Senator.\nOnly in 1795 did Rhode Island\u2019s chartered bank from 1791 open, <italic>Bank of Rhode Island</italic> in Newport, with Benjamin Seixas\u2019 son as cashier. Not until 1803 would Rhode Island\u2019s second bank open, <italic>Bank of Newport</italic>. While neither Seixas nor <italic>Bank of Newport</italic> president traded slaves, they invested in the trade. One of Rhode Island\u2019s largest slave traders, Audley Clarke, descended from Emperor Charlemagne, Henry I of England, and an early governor of Rhode Island colony, engaged in insurance and other industries, inter-marrying with the Newport elite. As a loyalist, Clarke left during the Revolution, but returned after to engage in <italic>Bank of Rhode Island</italic>, rum distilling, and whaling. Clarke\u2019s descendants continued to run banks for at least seven generations, with some becoming Unitarians.\nWhile Jefferson and other Southerners blocked bankruptcy for Northern merchants, another crisis grew. Back in 1790, <italic>Bank of Hamburg </italic>(\u201cBOH\u201d) eliminated coin deposits in favor of silver bullion\u2014and its liabilities circulated as \u2018<italic>virtual coins</italic>.\u2019 Following the fall of Holland in 1795, trade moved to Hamburg and deposits to BOH. This strengthened the virtual silver coins relative to the gold-based British <italic>pound</italic> and as BOE continued to restrict convertibility.\nFollowing elections in 1796, Georgia\u2019s legislature reversed the sale. Years later, the Court held the contract impairment unconstitutional. With the value of the collateral in question and British credit limited, investors ran from land company notes in the <italic>Panic of 1796</italic>. Unlike banks, the land companies had unlimited liability and liquidated holdings. America\u2019s land deflated as Morris and Duer sat in prison. So, Comfort Sands\u2019 son-in-law, Nathaniel Prime, founded New York\u2019s first stock trading private bank, <italic>Prime</italic>, in 1796. \nNathaniel descended from Emperor Charlemagne and an early settler of Rowley, Massachusetts, that later moved to Long Island. Within months, Comfort Sands defaulted on debts due to Morris and others. Since Morris\u2019 ally Thomas Rusel became President of FBUS <italic>Boston</italic>, he died in 1796, and was succeeded by Thomas-Handasyd Perkins until George Cabot replaced him. Perkins\u2019 sister married an extended cousin of <italic>Coutts</italic>\u2019 William Forbes of Monymusk.\nAfter the <italic>Treaty of Paris</italic> of 1783 transferred Florida to Spain, Spain granted a monopoly to <italic>Panton</italic> <italic>Forbes</italic>, which traded with Indians in both Spanish and America. Panton began his apprenticeship in 1765 with <italic>Gordon</italic> in Charleston.<italic> </italic><italic>Gordon</italic>\u2019s John Gordon\u2014related to the Drummond, Forbes, and Barclay families as well as Lord Adam Gordon, who directed capital into East Florida. Gordon\u2019s descendants, brothers Thomas and John Forbes, joined the firm, which traded with Florida Indians, and maintained their loyalty to Britain during the <italic>Revolution</italic>. After Panton died in 1801, the Forbes family took over, acquiring nearly two million acres of Indian land between the Saint-Marks and Apalachicola rivers However, in America, Congress monopolized the Native American fur trade to stabilize prices and relations from 1795.\nBy late 1797, rumors of French invasion started bank runs in Britain, leading BOE to suspend <italic>pound</italic> gold payouts while continuing to discount trade bills payable in London (\u201cMMBU\u201d), allowing banks to multiply. The inflow of European capital into Britain stimulated trade\u2014particularly of Virginian tobacco, which tripled in price\u2014until the protracted winter of 1798, pushed the merchants into insolvency. Without the ability to discount bills at BOH, Hamburg\u2019s strict bankruptcy law began fire selling collateral\u2014dropping prices and doubling the discount rate for other traders in April. By September, a banking crisis erupted and spread deflation internationally. \nAs the German states had become the second largest market for American goods\u2014deflation spread Virginian tobacco. Since earlier in the year, the <italic>Jay Treaty</italic> arbitration commission had dissolved after two years of operation by the withdrawal of the American members. Without its own banking and distribution infrastructure, Virginia was dependent on British tobacco marketing, but was cut off from BOE discounts. In January 1800, Congress amended DPRA, but as tobacco factor failures accelerated, it became difficult to transfer money from one city to another. Split along geographic lines, a new bill passed in the House on February 21st with  (\u201cBA1800\u201d) enacted into law on April 4th. \nBA1800 was modeled on English law; only creditors could initiate proceedings and only against mercantile\u2014including bankers\u2014debtors owing over $1,000. There were fewer than 500 filings, Robert Morris and Comfort Sands were two of the few to use BA1800 and obtain debt discharge and release from debtor\u2019s prison since Duer died in prison in 1799. \nThe Supreme Court decided that this was not a judicial operation and BA1800 was repealed two years later after Jefferson ascended to the presidency and concentrated power. So, states stayed stay debt for insolvents but without inter-state credit treaties like German states. Although litigation dragged on for years, Comfort Sands\u2019 son later joined <italic>Prime</italic>. (Likewise, Comfort Sands\u2019 second cousin, Henry Sands Brooks, founded one of America\u2019s first ready-made clothing retailers,<italic> Brooks Bros</italic>.)\nAmidst the financial crisis interruption of commercial relations with Europe amidst the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, Girard centralized his foreign capital with <italic>Baring</italic> in London. While BONY remained New York City\u2019s only bank, Aaron Burr\u2014the son of <italic>Princeton Uni</italic>\u2019s founder and descendant of three Puritan clergymen\u2014, Robert Livingston, and other BONY stockholders received a charter to supply water to the city and invest surplus capital in 1799. With the latter terms, they founded New York City\u2019s second bank, <italic>Manhattan Co Bank</italic>. \nWhile Burr\u2019s wife was an extended cousin of <italic>Barclay</italic>, <italic>Bingham</italic>, and <italic>Perry</italic>, he became Thomas Jefferson\u2019s VP from 1801. Although Thomas Jefferson had described debts to merchant banks as<italic> Perry Lane</italic>, \u201c<italic>These debts had become hereditary from father to son for many generations, so that the planters were a species of property annexed to certain mercantile houses in London</italic>.\u201d Jefferson\u2019s mother and wife were also <italic>Perry</italic>\u2019s extended cousin in-laws.\nAlthough a cousin of Charleston commission house <italic>Smit DeSaussure Darrell</italic>\u2019s Swiss DeSaussure co-founder married Theophile Cazenove\u2019s granddaughter in 1802, the house\u2019s supplier, <italic>Bird Savage </italic>defaulted in 1803, leading America\u2019s Minister to Britain, Rufus King, to shift to <italic>Baring</italic>. Cazenove\u2019s Huguenot co-religionist partner Albert Gallatin\u2014an extended cousin of Franco-Swiss banker Jacques Necker\u2014became UST Secretary, and by 1803, former BONY director Hamilton wrote the charter for <italic>Merchants</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Bank</italic>, where he was joined by James Roosevelt and Comfort Sands\u2019 brother Joshua, who later led the institution. However, Hamilton\u2019s life was cut short in 1804 after a duel with Aaron Burr. Moreover, Roosevelt faced competition. After leaving Germany and refining sugar in London, the Christian Havemeyer brothers established a sugar refinery in New York in 1807. \nAfter Congress banned slave import in 1808, trade collapsed with a general trade embargo. While French refugee Pierre DuPont\u2019s son Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e had refined saltpeter from British India for gunpowder, the embargo with Britain cut off supply, leading him to mine in Virginia and Kentucky with funds from Anthony Cazenove, who directed Virginia\u2019s<italic> Bank of Alexandria</italic> from 1810. While French origin linked Cazenove and DuPont before their children wed in 1860, other traders and financiers depended on marriage for business.\nSince America bought the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon with financing from <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Hope</italic> in 1803, Quakers moved there to connect trade. While Colonial Philadelphia\u2019s last Chief Justice Benjamin Chew had married a Shippen-in-law, his third cousin-once-removed Beverly Chew moved to New Orleans and became a leading slave trader with directorates on local banks, insurance, and shipping. By 1810, Beverly Chew married William Duer\u2019s daughter.\nSince serving as Louisiana\u2019s first governor until 1807, James Wilkinson became Envoy to Mexico. He was the husband of Ann Biddle, a member of Philadelphia\u2019s Quaker mercantile aristocracy, whose brother was General Washington\u2019s aide-de-camp and advanced his father\u2019s importing firm. After marrying the Quaker daughter of lieutenant governor and Justice of Rhode Island Gideon Cornell, their son Thomas became a banker and American Agent in France in the 1770s with Benajmin Franklin. He married Christine Williams. \nWhile Christine\u2019s father was the nephew of Benjamin Franklin, her mother was Marianne Alexander. With a Huguenot grandmother and a banker and Lord Provost of Edinburgh Scot grandfather related to the Argyll Campbell family, Marianne\u2019s brother was Robert. Having served as Benjamin Franklin\u2019s private secretary, Robert Alexander became a planter in Kentucky with interests in <italic>Kentucky River </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> and mines and become the first President of <italic>Bank of Kentucky</italic> in 1807. Soon after, Thomas Biddle\u2019s brother, also a banker, married Mary Barclay (of an unknown linage.)\nMeanwhile, FBUS <italic>Boston</italic> Cashier Peter Dalton became President, following the death of George Cabot, and Samuel Osgood took over FBUS <italic>New York</italic>. Before FBUS\u2019 charter expired in 1811, Girard urged Congress for an extension. As President Madison allowed the charter to expire, Girard took over FBUS <italic>Philadelphia</italic>\u2019s office and staff to form correspondent relationships with <italic>Baring</italic> in Britain and across America. While raising capital in London via <italic>Baring</italic>, Girard reclaimed his capital from the inconvertible <italic>pound</italic>. While UST kept funds in SBs, Girard\u2019s private bank remained an unincorporated merchant bank without issuing notes. Shortly after New York chartered FBUS <italic>New York</italic> into what became <italic>Citi</italic>, Samuel Osgood died by 1813. But as the British invaded during <italic>War of 1812</italic>, SBs failed, and credit collapsed. \nWhile Girard formed America\u2019s first UST debt syndicate to fund the war, Uriah Hendricks was one of the largest individual bond purchasers. The same year, Hendricks founded America\u2019s first metal concern, a copper-rolling mill in New Jersey. DuPont profited from wartime gunpowder sales. With European shareholders demanding funds, DuPont\u2019s Huguenot banker Bidermann arrived from Paris, married a DuPont daughter, and assumed leadership. Likewise, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e DuPont directed <italic>Delaware Farmers Bank</italic> from 1814. (Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e soon funded toll roads and a ferry, while his nephew founded <italic>Union Bank of Delaware</italic> and <italic>Columbia Insurance</italic>.) While Anthony Cazenove funded DuPont\u2019s mining with <italic>Bank of Alexandria</italic> since 1810, his daughter married a Clarke cousin associated with <italic>Bank of Rhode Island</italic>, and together sold DuPont\u2019s products.\nIn 1814, Washington, DC, banker Elisha Riggs formed <italic>Riggs Peabody</italic> with George Peabody after the young George impressed the seasoned Riggs and other merchants. Born in New England to Judith Dodge of Wenham and Thomas Peabody, descended from pre-<italic>Civil War</italic> England dissenters of the 1630s. While her cousin twice removed was a nephew of Nathaniel Prime, Judith\u2019s sister wed Nathaniel Prime\u2019s fourth cousin, who was also connected closer by marriage.\nAfter disputing with fellow Puritan leaders in Massachusetts in the 1630s, Reverend Thomas Hooker left to found Connecticut Colony. His granddaughter, a descendent of Campbell and Scottish royalty, wed James Pierpont, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne who became the Pastor of New Haven, Connecticut, and one of the three co-founders of <italic>Yale</italic>. Their grandson began lawyering in the 1810s but ordained in the clergy. Marrying a descendant of Elder John Strong, their daughter Juliet later wed banker Junius Morgan, a Unitarian minister\u2019s grandson descended from Joseph Morgan, who co-founded <italic>Aetna Insurance </italic>in 1818.\nReverend Hooker had highlighted the structural resemblance between commercial, civil, and religious organizations, rooted in the concept of \u2018communion\u2019 among members, which resembled shareholding and conferred privileges. Church members enjoyed a community like commercial shareholders, mirroring growing companies like EIC. New England\u2019s decentralized corporate order allowed independent community operation, with churches initially regulating conduct but eventually stepping back from commerce governance. Investments began to yield returns in the 1630s, attracting entrepreneurs and British emigrants, and networks expanded across colonies. New England\u2019s pivotal role in developing market economies persisted until Philadelphia financiers gained political influence in the 1790s.\nReverend Hooker trained <italic>Harvard</italic> graduate Reverend Thomas Allens of Northampton, Massachusetts, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and a second great-grand son of Elder John Strong, who became the first minister in Pittsfield in 1764. Thomas\u2019 brother Reverend Moses graduated from <italic>Princeton</italic> and served as a minister, notably in Midway, Georgia, where the church he oversaw was destroyed by the British in 1777. Their brother Major Solomon, served as an officer in the <italic>Revolution</italic>, helped suppress <italic>Shay</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>s Rebellion</italic>. Major Solomon later became a Minister and established four churches. In 1815, his sons Moses and Solomon founded <italic>Allens</italic>, a proto-investment bank involved domestic exchange, including drafts, bills, and checks, with branch offices in cities like Charleston, Augusta, New Orleans, Cincinnati, and others. <italic>Allens</italic> capitalized on the lottery trend by circulating tickets promoting <italic>Union Canal Lottery</italic> for development financing. \nImproved relations between America and Britain also spurred kinterlinks. Amidst the crisis of the <italic>War of 1812</italic>, Eliza Roosevelt Barclay married former BONY President Isaac Roosevelt\u2019s son James, since his DeLancey cousin wife died. While Eliza died after the war ended, her great uncle, Reverend Thomas Barclay, who married Susan Colden DeLancey, represented Britain to America since 1799. While one of their sons served as aid-de-camp to King George IV in Britain, Henry founded a Portuguese wine commission house in New York after the <italic>War of 1812</italic>. He served as an agent for <italic>Lloyd</italic> and was joined by his nephew Schuyler Livingston.\nAnother <italic>War of 1812</italic><italic> </italic>financier was Jacob Barker, a Quaker Russell Howland cousin from Maine who became a rising merchant in New York. Under the influence of <italic>Tammany Hall</italic>, a powerful political organization led by Aaron Burr within the New York Republican party, Barker was his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, rising to the rank of \u2018Sachem.\u2019. Litigation related to federal government loans led him to open <italic>Exchange Bank</italic> in 1815, a non-incorporated institution that competed with chartered banks. Barker\u2019s private bank gained popularity among mechanics and residents who could not gain services from chartered banks.\nBarker joined Girard in demanding conditions on advancing funds to UST from 1815. With the financial support of Girard, Astor, Barker, and London\u2019s <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Reid Irving</italic>, Congress chartered <italic>Second</italic> <italic>BUS</italic> (\u201cSBUS\u201d) in 1816\u2014following a bill introduced by Laurens Pinckney-cousin-in-law John Calhoun of South Carolina\u2014based upon Hamilton FBUS charter with an initial term of twenty years. \nFrom the start, SBUS was tied to commerce. Back in 1810, the last year of a functioning FBUS, New York Legislature appointed Patroon Stephen Rensselaer III, New York Senator Gouverneur Morris (General Philip John Schuyler\u2019s cousin once removed and a cousin of BONY\u2019s former president), New York Mayor Charles DeWitt Clinton (a Long Island Jones in-law and the Patroon\u2019s cousin-in-law), <italic>Manhattan Co Bank</italic>\u2019s Robert Livingston, and Governor Cadwallader Colden\u2019s grandson to construct <italic>Erie Canal</italic>. However, the project was soon stalled by the <italic>War of 1812</italic>. \nBy 1817, Clinton became Governor of New York and construction resumed with state subsidies and led by the Patroon. As merchant William Bayard, the Patroon\u2019s third cousin, saw his daughter marry the Patroon\u2019s son, he helped sell bonds to <italic>Manhattan Co Bank</italic>, <italic>Bank of Albany</italic>, and others. Designed to link the Hudson River at Albany to Lake Erie in Buffalo, the canal began reducing freight charges by 1822, even three years before its completion. Toll revenues quickly covered construction costs, propelling New York to economic dominance over rivals, and spurring similar projects.\nAgainst the advice of Girard and Astor, President Madison appointed his extended cousin-in-law William Jones to lead SBUS. Unrelated to the Jones of Long Island, William Jones represented Philadelphia in Congress at the turn of the century. Appointed Secretary of the Navy by President Madison, Jones reorganized the department in 1813 and briefly served as Acting Secretary of UST during the <italic>War of 1812</italic>. As SBUS\u2019 charter restricted individual shareholders to thirty votes, Girard, the largest stockholder, resigned his SBUS directorship in 1817. Court Justice Brockholst Livingston was another early director.\nAlthough FBUS had eight branches, SBUS started with eighteen. New York City was the state\u2019s sole branch, of which John Astor was the first President. SBUS <italic>New York</italic> was closely tied to <italic>Merchants</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Bank</italic> and BONY. While the first President of <italic>Merchants</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Bank </italic>became an SBUS <italic>New York</italic> director, his successor was a brother and partner of a founding director of BONY, and the third CEO had been on the board of BONY and married the daughter of its third president. Along with controlling SBUS <italic>Boston</italic>, Boston Brahmin led the only branch north of Boston, in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where merchant Ebenezer Wenthworth\u2014whose second cousin once removed married Stephen Higginson\u2019s son\u2014served as Cashier.\nOhio had two SBUS branches. A director of SBUS <italic>Cincinnati</italic> was Martin Baum. An Alsace-born Presbyterian, Baum arrived in America at a young age with his parents, and settled in Maryland. After joining General Wayne as an apothecary in 1794, Baum became as a merchant in Cincinnati in 1800, and established the bank-like <italic>Miami Exportation Society</italic> in 1803 to collect and transport corn and other grain from western farmers to New Orleans. Marrying a sister-in-law of Judge Burnet in 1805, he co-founded Cincinnati\u2019s first iron foundry, sugar refinery, steam-powered flour mill, and the City of Toledo, Ohio. \nJohn Cameron led North Carolina\u2019s branch, SBUS <italic>Fayetteville</italic>. His father was an Episcopal priest descended from Scotland and mother a third cousin of President Washington. John\u2019s brother Duncan was admitted to the North Carolina bar in 1798, and married an extended cousin-in-law of President Taylor in 1803. Another brother wed an extended cousin-in-law of presidents Madison and Jefferson. Along with growing a plantation, he engaged in various public service roles, investing in <italic>North Carolina</italic> SB in 1810 and serving intermittingly as bank president and a judge. In 1811, planter and Colonel William Polk became director of <italic>North Carolina</italic> SB and the board elected him her first President. \nSBUS <italic>Baltimore</italic>\u2019s senior management included Cashier James McCulloch and directors George Williams, John Colts, and his father-in-law, Robert Oliver. A Presbyterian, Oliver arrived in Baltimore from Ireland in 1783 and became an importer and soon owned western Maryland coal lands. Three years after arriving, he married a sister-in-law of James Craig. Arriving from Scotland in 1750, Craig owned armed privateers during the <italic>Revolution</italic>, engaged in harassing British trade. In 1776, Craig became a Commissioner of Naval Stores alongside Robert Morris. By 1811, Craig\u2019s daughter married Nicholas Biddle and Oliver became his advisor. \nGeorge Williams\u2014a descendant of Puritan Minister Roger Williams, the founder of Providence, Rhode Island\u2014migrated from New England to Baltimore and married Elizabeth Hawkins, with ancestral ties dating back before Lord Baltimore\u2019s charter. For his counting house\u2019s shipping agent, Williams hired McCulloch, a descendant of Rhode Island\u2019s Quaker Fry family. While Williams sought to overcome SBUS\u2019 voting restrictions by registering shares under numerous shares under various names, McCulloch used deposits to buy shares for himself. Although larceny, defined as stealing without ownership, was acknowledged, the rapid evolution of entrepreneurial practices was outpacing legal regulations, leading to gaps such as the absence of laws addressing bank deposit embezzlement in both federal and Maryland state legislation.\nWhile Kentucky had two SBUS branches from 1817, the Southeast only had one in Louisiana. Since Haim Salomon died, his son helped intermediate for Jewish factors of Southern cotton as the inaugural cashier of SBUS <italic>Lexington </italic>in Kentucky and then SBUS <italic>New Orleans</italic> until his death in 1821, when William Duer\u2019s son-in-law, already Collector of the Port, took over as SBUS <italic>New Orleans</italic> President. \nDespite the hostility between America and Britain, Jews linked commerce and finance between the two lands. Before America\u2019s <italic>Revolution</italic>, Levy Solomons had a vast business spanning from Michilimackinac to the Saint-Lawrence and the Hudson River. Shortly after he married Rebecca Franks in 1775, Americans invaded Canada in 1776 and confiscated a significant portion of his stores. Still, he continued trading until his death in 1792. By 1802, Levy\u2019s daughter married Aaron Hart\u2019s nephew, Henry Joseph. \nBy then, David Franks\u2019 son Jacob entered the fur trade and settled in Green Bay by 1797. He expanded his business, establishing the region\u2019s first sawmill and gristmill in 1805. During the <italic>War of 1812</italic>, Jacob Franks supplied equipment to Native American forces and played a pivotal role in capturing Mackinac Island in 1812. After the war, Levy Solomons\u2019 children married Gershom Seixas\u2019 daughter in 1816 and Jacob Franks in 1817. Together with Henry Joseph, the in-laws created an extensive network of trading posts across Canada, centered in Berthier with branches in Montreal and Quebec.\nSince South Carolina granted Jews full political rights in 1790, Charleston\u2019s Jewish community was the largest in America by 1800. Although Jewish merchants dominated Charleston trade from the late 18th, few Jews held official roles in banks. Established in 1819, SBUS <italic>Charleston</italic> processed more business than any SBUS branch outside New York and New Orleans and set the pattern for local banks. \nThese banks included <italic>Bank of South Carolina</italic> (1792), <italic>Union Bank</italic> (1810), <italic>Planters & Mechanics Bank</italic> (1810), and <italic>Bank of the State of South Carolina</italic> (1812). In 1815, Benjamin Seixas\u2019 son of New York kinterlinked with Philip Cohen\u2014a grandnephew of Moses Hays and second cousin twice removed of David Franks\u2014connected Charleston bankers. As Cohen\u2019s brother-in-law Myer Moses served as director of <italic>Planters & Mechanics Bank</italic>, Cohen\u2019s brother-in-law Joshua Lazarus presided over <italic>Cheraw Bank</italic>.\nWhile banks had few Jews, Jewish and Christian pioneers kinterlinked. Joseph Philipson, born in Prussian Poland, immigrated to America by the early 1800s and settled in Philadelphia with his brothers. By 1803, he joined their fur and lead trading business, working with a co-religionist agent Zachary Mussina\u2014possibly connected to Prague and Dutch Jewry\u2014and trading with John Astor and Moses Austin.\nIn 1807, the brothers, backed by Mussina\u2019s Christian in-law Christian Wilt, opened a mercantile business in Saint-Louis. In 1812, Philipson discussed building a distillery with Wilt. As the Territorial Legislature chartered <italic>Bank of S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Louis</italic>, the bank opened in 1816 under President Samuel Hammond, Wilt as Secretary, Moses Austin as a director, and Philipson as an investor. In 1817, <italic>Bank of Missouri</italic> incorporated, with Philipson and Wilt among her ten largest investors. By then, Wilt built a distillery in Illinois.\nJews also helped form Canada\u2019s dominant bank after many unsuccessful attempts to establish banks in British North America. After <italic>Halifax Fire Insurance Association</italic> formed in 1809, <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> started under articles of association in 1817. Directing <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> from 1818, David David promoted a canal between Montreal\u2019s port and Lachine to improve communications with Upper Canada. The credit and canal bolstered fellow <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> investor,<italic> </italic>Aaron Hart\u2019s son, who was among the first to use steamboats for this traffic. As <italic>Quebec Bank</italic> and Montreal\u2019s <italic>Bank of Canada</italic> started the following year, <italic>Bank of New Brunswick</italic> was the first to receive a charter in 1820. While Canada\u2019s first three bank charters received royal assent by 1822, <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> dominated Canadian banking for decades.\nKnickerbockers were also closed involved in Canadian banking. Born in Connecticut to Charles DeWitt Clinton\u2019s second cousin, Jacob DeWitt and his family moved to Montreal around 1802, where Jacob initially apprenticed in his father\u2019s hat business before entering the hardware trade. His ventures expanded into shipping, acquiring steamships, and banking. In 1822, he was a founding member of <italic>Bank of Canada</italic>, and in 1835, he co-founded <italic>Banque du Peuple</italic> to rival <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic>. Outside of business, he was elected to the Lower Canadian Assembly in 1830, where he served for three decades, and co-founded the American Presbyterian Church in Montreal, where he served as an elder from 1830.\nHowever, panic struck America soon after SBUS formed. While Congress resumed gold payouts in 1817, SBUS floated a two-year loan to pay for the Louisiana Territory via <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Reid Irving</italic> in London, <italic>Hope</italic> in Amsterdam, and <italic>Hottinguer</italic> in Paris. By early 1818, Maryland targeted SBUS <italic>Baltimore</italic> by enacting a law imposing a $15,000 annual tax on banks not chartered by the state legislature. As Maryland challenged SBUS\u2019 constitutionality and taxed SBUS to promote her banks, Pennsylvania and Ohio threatened to follow, and the Court considered <italic>McCulloch v. Maryland</italic>. By then the first Louisiana Territory installment stretched SBUS\u2019 gold reserves. As SBUS President William Jones tightened credit, frontier banks called in credit. \nWhile SBUS<italic> </italic>kept European credit, credit remained strained from 1817 to 1819, with high discounts and failures taking down with some of DuPont\u2019s agencies. <italic>Bank of S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Louis</italic> suspended specie payments in March 1818. SUBS <italic>Cincinnati </italic>Director Martin Baum, suffered significant losses. Like his brother-in-law Judge Burnet, Baum surrendered his home and property to settle his SUBS debts. Congress investigated. In 1819, the Court did not allow New Hampshire to impair a charter and soon overturned New York\u2019s bankruptcy law. \nAmidst SBUS <italic>Baltimore</italic>\u2019s fraud scandal, William Jones resigned as SBUS President in early 1819 as cotton prices collapsed. Voiding Maryland\u2019s SBUS tax in <italic>McCulloch v. Maryland</italic>, the Court allowed SBUS to re-start under Langdon Cheves. The son of a Scottish immigrant who traded with the Cherokee, Cheves was a leader in the Scotch Presbyterian Church and built a law firm with a Quaker from the British Indies. While the partnership ended after Cheves joined Congress, his partner married a Pinckney. Allying with Laurens Pinckney-cousin-in-law John Calhoun of South Carolina and fellow Southern Democrat Henry Clay of Kentucky and as well as Quaker Pennsylvania, Cheves became House Speaker. \nAs a Louisiana Territory gold payout approached, Cheves cut credit and UST stopped credit land sales. As some state banks printed inflationary unsecured paper currency, others cut customer credit and suspended specie payments, and the <italic>Panic of 1819 </italic>was worst in Cincinnati, Ohio, and other industrial frontiers. Linking charters to payouts, Maryland allowed banks to count broker notes. Other states also legalized bearer term deposits. Bank contraction and insolvency applications increased until 1822. As the Court prevented state debt impairments, insolvencies grew. \nDespite resuming payments since suspending in 1818, <italic>Bank of S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Louis</italic> failed in 1819. For the Missouri land district in 1820, <italic>Bank of Missouri</italic> became the federal money depository. That year, Joseph Philipson joined <italic>Bank of Missouri</italic>\u2019s board as he co-founded <italic>S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Louis</italic> <italic>Brewery </italic><italic>& </italic><italic>Distillery</italic> and <italic>S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Louis</italic> <italic>Sawmill</italic>. As Christian Wilt died and the <italic>Panic of 1819</italic> continued, <italic>Bank of Missouri</italic> entered liquidation in summer 1822. Philipson was forced to liquidate his assets to cover debts and withdrew from banking by 1823. After these failures the city was left without banking facilities except for some private agencies.\nAfter Thomas Willing\u2019s son wed a Lloyd cousin in 1819 and Cheves sought to step down, the 90-year-old Willing was the popular candidate, but died in 1821. As Huguenot Albert Gallatin and Quaker James Lloyd were unwilling to serve, Quaker Nicholas Biddle of Philadelphia replaced Cheves as SBUS President in 1823. \nWhile Biddle\u2019s in-laws were losing power, they continued to have a broad sway. Nicholas\u2019 second cousin-in-law, Robert Alexander, resigned from <italic>Bank of Kentucky</italic> in 1821 when the state established a competing bank. Despite this, Robert remained active in Kentucky\u2019s development, while his brother, William Alexander, served as the head of the Court of Common Pleas in Britain from 1824. Within a year, another of Nicholas\u2019 second cousin-in-law, Envoy to Mexico James Wilkinson passed away. One of the four brothers to go West, Thomas Biddle ended up in Saint-Louis as army paymaster in the newly created state of Missouri and married a local heiress. Under Nicholas Biddle, SBUS soon grew to twenty-five branches by 1830.\nAside from family, Biddle interconnected trade with SBUS. He added Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e DuPont as a director, and corresponded with Huguenot <italic>Hottinguer</italic> for Paris, and Lutheran <italic>Baring</italic> and Quaker <italic>Overend Gurney</italic> for London. Since Jean-Conrad Hottinguer had returned to Paris after Napoleon assumed power, he named Henri Escher a godfather to his children, and Escher led <italic>Hottinguer</italic> in America. From 1826, <italic>Baring</italic> partnered with the Boston Brahmin. After working with Thomas Perkins and marrying Russ Sturgis\u2019 cousin, Joshua Bates founded <italic>Baring</italic> Boston to link Boston Brahmin Asia trader <italic>Russell</italic> to London. While of unknown relation to other Russells, <italic>Russell</italic> founder Samuel Russell descended from reverends Pierpont and Hooker. \nAfter marrying a Lloyd and Wharton cousin in 1821, Cornelius Shaack Roosevelt joined Prime, Astor, Livingston, and others to found <italic>Chemical Bank </italic>in New York by 1824. At Astor\u2019s suggestion, <italic>Prime</italic> hired Astor\u2019s affiliate James King in 1826, whose father resigned as Senator of New York to be Britain\u2019s Ambassador. Moreover, King\u2019s cousin-in-laws traded successfully in Chile as<italic> Wetmore Cryder</italic> <italic>Alsop</italic>. \nFor her American financial agent and counsel the same year, BOE retained Richard Blatchford, son of a British-born non-Conformist Reverend, who also became counsel for SBUS. While Blatchford started practicing law in New York in 1819, he befriended fellow <italic>Union College</italic> graduate and Upstate New York lawyer William Seward over their shared opposition to President Andrew Jackson\u2019s Democratic Party. \nAnother casualty of the <italic>Panic of 1819</italic> was Quaker Russell Howland cousin Jacob Barker, who had financed the <italic>War of 1812</italic>, founded  <italic>Exchange Bank</italic> in 1815, and advocated for SBUS. Since his private bank failed in the <italic>Panic of 1819</italic>, Barker invested in insurers. These included <italic>Mercantile Insurance of New York</italic> and <italic>Western & Dutchess County Insurance</italic>, illegally banking by issuing bonds for promissory notes and industrial assets. \nWith <italic>Erie Canal</italic> opening profitably and British financial events, New York saw a speculative frenzy. As insurance and loan companies grew, Barker withdrew due to competition from undercapitalized rivals. He then backed <italic>Life & Fire Insurance</italic>, whose bond-like notes circulated as quasi-currency until 1825, when court action ended this illegal banking during the \u2018Conspiracy Trials.\u2019 <italic>Life & Fire</italic>\u2019s reckless lending, coupled with the British speculative bubble burst and cotton price drop, caused widespread financial distress in the <italic>Panic of 1825</italic>.\nAmerica exported some charcoal-based pig iron, but her ports imported British coal and iron until the British blockade. Virginia produced most domestic coal, but the planter-led government favored cash crops. With less fertile soil, growing Kentucky and Tennessee spurred the coal trade. In 1825, merchant Thomas Yeatman\u2014who had married a Charlemagne-descendant Erwin sister of Henry Clay\u2019s son-in-law\u2014organized private bank <italic>Yeatman </italic>in Nashville, Tennessee, and then iron forges. The state\u2019s first bank, <italic>Bank of the State of </italic><italic>Tennessee</italic> and operated as the state's principal financial institution. By 1826, Tennessee outlawed the inter-state slave trade.\nIn North Caroline, meanwhile, Colonel William Polk resigned as President of <italic>North Carolina</italic> SB to manage his 100,000-acre estate in Tennessee in 1819. By then, Duncan Cameron, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, saw his brother become President of SBUS <italic>Fayetteville</italic> in 1817, but Duncan lost one election in 1820 because of opposition to bank aristocracy. While many planters engaged in money lending, often requiring land or slaves as collateral, about a tenth of North Carolina\u2019s elite planters invested in <italic>North Carolina</italic> SB. As mismanagement nearly forced <italic>North Carolina </italic>SB\u2019s branch in Burke County to close in 1829, the Erwins took over and nearly monopolized the branch for decades. \nSince his sister married a Campbell cousin-in-law and brother presided over SBUS <italic>Lafayette</italic>, Duncan Cameron was President of <italic>North Carolina</italic> SB and invested in railroads in the early 1830s. After <italic>North Carolina</italic> SB reorganized in 1834, Duncan was elected President. Duncan\u2019s son married a Ruffin in 1832, the family\u2019s influence extended into Alabama and Mississippi. The family\u2019s connections with prominent members like Thomas Ruffin, Archibald Murphey, Willie Mangum, and William Graham shaped North Carolina\u2019s political and economic landscape. \nMeanwhile, Robert Fulton\u2019s steamboat invention gained Louisiana and New York charters. But Cornelius Vanderbilt\u2014cousin of BONY\u2019s John\u2014violated the monopoly of Fulton and Robert Livingston by operating between New York and New Jersey. As Congress regulated inter-state <italic>commerce</italic> per the <italic>Constitution</italic>, the Court quashed the charters. So, as Vanderbilt consolidated in the North, another monopoly controlled shipping to New Orleans. \nSubsidized like New York\u2019s <italic>Erie Canal</italic>, New Jersey\u2019s <italic>Morris Canal & Banking Co</italic> connected Pennsylvania coal to New York ports. Similarly, <italic>Brown </italic>and Robert Oliver\u2014who owned western Maryland coal lands and was married to the aunt of SBUS\u2019 Nicholas Biddle\u2014promoted<italic> Baltimore & Ohio</italic> RR to compete with Pennsylvania\u2019s canal. Since the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> inflated coal, merchants funded Kentucky and Tennessee coal canals and roads. In his last investment before dying, Girard took over Pennsylvania\u2019s insolvent canal to service his bank\u2019s coal lands. Moreover, states chartered <italic>canal, turnpike, and</italic> <italic>railroad</italic> <italic>holding companies</italic> (\u201cRHCs\u201d). While New Jersey chartered canals with a bank, New York added mines, as did Pennsylvania for <italic>Lehigh</italic> RR. Maryland allowed <italic>Baltimore & Ohio RR</italic> to buy stock of other roads. Tariffs soon spurred domestic coal mining.\nIndustrial growth shifted New England\u2019s economy from trade to manufacturing. Mill owners such as Francis Cabot Lowell and Patrick Tracy backed a tariff to protect cotton production. The Boston associates, including the Lowells and Appletons, supported the measure to secure investment returns. In contrast, merchants like Henry Lee, Perkins, Cabot, and Otis opposed the tariff because it threatened trade. \nEnacting the <italic>Tariff of 1828</italic> (\u201cTA1828\u201d) in his last year as president, John Adams was replaced by Tennessee Senator General Andrew Jackson in 1829. As TA1828 fueled economic decline in South Carolina and concerns among planters and urban businessmen, Laurens Pinckney cousin-in-law John Calhoun represented the Charleston patriciate in an antinationalist stance, even as constituents in western South Carolina aligned with President Jackson. So did the Polks of North Carolina and Tennessee. However, as <italic>Bank of the State of Tennessee</italic> failed in 1830, SBUS <italic>Nashville</italic> started soon after. After <italic>Yeatman</italic> banker Thomas Yeatman of Nashville died in 1833, Tennessee chartered <italic>Union Bank</italic> and <italic>Planters Bank.</italic>\nSince <italic>Holland Land Co</italic> and <italic>Connecticut Land Co</italic> controlled land in western New York and Ohio\u2019s Western Reserve in the 1790s, land sales created a class of independent farmers who challenged established elites by the 1820s. By 1830, groups in Geauga County, Ohio, linked their efforts to earlier resistance against land monopolies. In New York, they opposed <italic>Holland Land Co</italic>\u2019s privileges, and in Vermont, they contested local aristocratic power. In Massachusetts, Benjamin Hallett connected this resistance to Democratic opposition to banks and monopolies. In Vermont, legislators split over internal development, and newspapers criticized Whig support for SBUS. By the early 1830s, many of these supporters joined the Democratic Party and adopted Jacksonian policies.\nBy 1832, calls for competition against <italic>Lehigh</italic>\u2019s monopoly led Pennsylvania to charter <italic>COALA</italic>. Without financing, a Quaker metal importer discounted <italic>COALA</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>CP. Likewise, TA1828 helped shift Jewish migration from Charleston toward New York and other cities, especially as Jewish gained rights. Having fled Bavaria for Maryland, a family of Cohens from Oberdorff\u2014not closely related to the Frankfurt Cohens\u2014fought in the <italic>War of 1812</italic>. After winning the right for Jews to hold local office, Cohen was elected to office, from where he advocated for and promoting the construction of <italic>Philadelphia, Wilmington, & Baltimore </italic>RR from 1836, when he also became a director of <italic>Baltimore & Ohio</italic> RR. \nAmerica\u2019s <italic>Revolution</italic> and the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> cut off indentured servants. But cheap coal steam ships allowed free laborers to pay. Northern states imprisoned debtors five times more than for other crimes in 1830. Instead of property seizure or bondage, prisoners made goods and paved roads. Following Kentucky and Delaware, Congress outlawed debt prisons. Jews helped industrialize Kentucky.\nEarlier, to help Robert Morris finance America\u2019s <italic>Revolution</italic>, Haim Salomon sold government land in Kentucky to Michael Gratz, his co-religionist in Philadelphia whose brother-in-law was an uncle of <italic>Samuel Phillips</italic>. Similarly, Aaron Levy, David Franks\u2019 former partner and a landowner, adopted Gratz\u2019s son Simon. In 1793, Michael Gratz\u2019s daughter married Moses Hays\u2019 cousin, and in his 1804 will, Levy bequeathed significant land to Gratz. These holdings became the foundation for Gratz\u2019s land development efforts from 1805.\nWhile Benjamin Gratz, Michael\u2019s son, served as a lieutenant during the <italic>War of 1812</italic>, his brother Simon co-founded <italic>Schuylkill Bank</italic> in Philadelphia in 1813, while also overseeing the family\u2019s various ventures, including land speculation, shipping, and dry goods. After the war, Haim Salomon\u2019s son, Ezekiel, became the first head of SBUS <italic>Lexington</italic>. After Ezekiel moved to lead SBUS <italic>New Orleans</italic>, he invited Benjamin to manage the family\u2019s Western operations. However, Ezekiel died soon after. \nBenjamin relocated to Lexington, where he married a Christian woman descended from the 1st Earl of Argyll. Her sister had married Henry Clay\u2019s brother-in-law. In 1830, Benjamin co-founded and became a leader of <italic>Lexington & Ohio </italic>RR, while Simon, alongside Philadelphia investors, established <italic>Wiconisco</italic> <italic>Coal </italic><italic>CO</italic>. The company began mining coal at Bear Creek Gap and selling it locally by 1832. The same year, they created <italic>Lykens Valley </italic>RR<italic> & Coal Co</italic> to transport the coal to Millersburg. By 1835, Benjamin founded the Lexington branch of <italic>Bank of Kentucky</italic>. Though he continued attending Jewish services on holidays, his children married outside the faith, including into the family of Henry Clay.\nWhile <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Barclay</italic> thwarted Quaker attempts to abolish slavery in 1783. This changed with the advent of shippable large coal cargoes, supporting <italic>Robarts</italic> and other banker politicians. Since the number of privileged Blacks like Francis Williams grew, so did White poverty and indentured servitude, fueling calls to limit the importation of Black servants into Britain. After America\u2019s <italic>Revolution</italic>, Black loyalists left with the British forces, expecting to receive promised land and funds. However, they found themselves continually denied these claims, leading to homelessness and destitution, particularly in Nova Scotia and the Bahamas. \nSince the 1790, British Blacks petitioned for a British colony in Sierra Leone, away from slave plantations and White competition. Negotiations with King Naimbanna of Koya in Sierra Leone led to the establishment of Granville Town. Like African royalty did for generations, Naimbanna sent his sons to study in France and Britain. However, challenges arose with the onset of a severe rainy season and delays in supplies. As conflicts with local leaders escalated, Granville Town was eventually burned down. Still, settlers continued migrating. \nSome Jews even assimilated Black slaves. In the 1790s, Barbados\u2019 wealthiest Jew, Abraham Brandon married Sarah Lopes. While their mulatto children were born enslaved, upon relocating to New York, two of the children ascended the Jewish elite by marrying into the Seixas-in-law Moses family.\nInitially protected by British naval power and later by a French alliance during the <italic>American Revolution</italic>, newly formed America had to address Barbary pirates individually after gaining independence. In 1785, Thomas Jefferson proposed an international coalition to compel the Barbary states to peace but faced challenges and opted for negotiations. During Jefferson\u2019s presidency, America confronted the Barbary in the Mediterranean. In response to Tripoli\u2019s demands for tribute payments, Jefferson dispatched a squadron of frigates in 1801. The aggressive action led Tunis and Algiers to break their alliance with Tripoli. Despite setbacks, such as the loss of the frigate Philadelphia, Jefferson remained committed to military intervention. In 1805, a treaty ended hostilities, but America continued to pay a ransom for sailors enslaved by Algiers. \nIn Africa, meanwhile, militant Islamic movements arose from the western Sudan to Guinea grew since the 1790s. Against the Hausa (around modern Nigeria), Usman Fodio led a jihad from 1804, culminating in the establishment of the vast Sokoto Caliphate by 1809. This jihad transformed the region, creating a Muslim emirate aristocracy ruling over various communities, including free or servile peasants (talakawa). Emirs distributed land as fiefs to office-holding nobles and slaves for tax collection. They wielded significant power, intervening in production systems and overseeing urban merchants. The state\u2019s revenue included corv\u00e9e labor, rents in kind, and monetary taxes on the talakawa. In governance, central fiscal policies, particularly in emirates like Kano, incentivized immigration, regulated tariffs, and promoted commodity production.\nIn Venice, Napoleon ennobled the Treves family, dating back to the Jewish princes of Narbonne, for financing a treaty with the Barbary pirates, and launching Venice\u2019s first food shipping venture with the Americas. Likewise, Todros, also with Narbonne roots, and of Davidic descendant, kinterlinked with the Katz-<italic>Samuel Phillips</italic>. After Britain\u2019s <italic>Parliament</italic> banned the slave trade in 1807 during the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, Britain advanced free<italic> </italic>labor and trade campaign by settling Sierra Leone in 1808 after the fall of the French Empire<italic>.</italic> \nThe British Admiral Sidney Smith (not closely related to <italic>Smyth</italic> bankers) led the charge to end Barbary\u2019s White slavery. As the <italic>Society of Knights Liberators of the White Slaves of Africa</italic> gained support across Europe, Smith and his knights advocated for war with North Africa\u2019s lawless rulers during the <italic>Congress of Vienna</italic> in 1814. The turning point came in 1815 with American naval victories leading to treaties ending tribute payments and influencing European to follow suit by the 1830s. \nSince 1750, the administration of <italic>English Africa Co</italic> (\u201cEAC\u201d) slave forts in the Gold Coast shifted to <italic>Co of Merchants Trading to Africa</italic>, a regulated corporation open to any merchant upon payment of a nominal fee. Coastal administration remained minimal with a governor, a small council, soldiers at Cape Coast Castle, and a chief with a small military force. Financial difficulties persisted. Dissolving in 1821, EAC\u2019s possessions were vested in the Crown. In 1828, a committee of London merchants took charge of the Gold Coast bases under the supervision of the Governor of Sierra Leone. \nWhile Henry Thornton, <italic>Sierra Leone Co</italic> first Chair, died in 1815, his cousins held sway\u2014as a <italic>Smyth</italic> partner governed Sierra Leone from 1808 to 1810 on William Bird Wilberforce\u2019s recommendation\u2014and the family reinforced bonds as a Smyth cousin married a Thornton in 1824. And as colonialism grew in the East Indies, Britain outlawed the Hindu promotion of widow suicide in 1829. By then a Smyth cousin directed Far East trader <italic>Magniac </italic><italic>Smyth</italic> shortly before Parliament abolished EIC\u2019s monopoly in 1833.\nSince the Saint-Domingue Revolution of 1791 led to creation of Haiti, slave revolutionary Henri Christophe rose to power in northern Haiti, proclaiming himself president in 1807 and later king in 1811. Implementing a nobility and corvee labor system, the French <italic>Code</italic>, and infrastructure projects, Christophe aimed to fortify Haiti, but his authoritarian rule faced criticism. Following his suicide in 1820, Jean-Pierre Boyer reunified control of the island in 1820 and ruled until 1843. \nSince Haiti\u2019s independence in 1804, France demanded 150 million <italic>francs</italic> in compensation. In 1825, Haiti paid the first installment with a 30 million <italic>franc</italic> bond, issued at 80% value, with <italic>Temaux-Gandolphe</italic>, <italic>Paravey</italic>, <italic>Laffitte</italic>, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris participating. Financial difficulties led to an 1838 agreement reducing the debt to 90 million <italic>francs</italic> and extending repayment over 30 years. The final payment was not made until 1883 due to ongoing political instability. \nDuring the <italic>War of 1812</italic>, America\u2019s Congress had authorized piracy as they had during the <italic>Revolution</italic>. During peacetime, sone American pirates repurposed as illegal slavers, navigating through the British blockade to access West African slave ports. As <italic>American Colonization Society</italic> established in 1816 to encourage American freed blacks to settle in Haiti and create a settlement for them in Africa, the effort led to Liberia in 1822. Transitioning from a colony, Liberia soon followed Haiti as the second independent Black republic, as descendants of the original settlers formed the governing elite. From then, Anglo-American naval patrols sought to intercept slave shippers. Similarly, Portugal legally abolished prazos, land grants to European, Indian, and mixed-race overlords to control local Africans and slaves. However, since they had institutionalized using family networks, many prazos continued to function throughout the century.\nHowever, Britain tried not to disrupt the status quo and set off imperial races with direct colonization. Since the Omani ousted the Portuguese from Mombasa and established dynastic sovereignty in the 17th century, these territories formed a center of an Indian-led Arabian slave and spice trade. To combat piracy and the slave trade, Britain signing treaties with the Omani sultans from 1820. \nAs the British government rejected a protectorate over Mombasa started by the Navy, Oman took Mombasa over in 1826, soon ruling much of East Africa north of Lourengo Marques and south of the Horn of Africa, including Zanzibar, with the support of Britain. After subduing the Mazrui leaders in Mombasa by 1837, the Sultan expanded Omani influence along the East African coast. His reign saw the establishment of clove plantations and a robust trade network that attracted Arab and Asian merchants as the Sultan shifted his capital from Muscat to Zanzibar in 1840.\nBut as France claimed Algeria by 1830, Egypt and Tunisia sought independence, Turkey ended autonomous rule in Libyan Tripoli. During this time, Robert Owen\u2019s ideas for social reorganization led Southerners to explore alternatives to slavery with failed experiments at Nashoba and New Harmony. Along with founding the <italic>Mississippi Bar Association</italic> and of <italic>Trinity Episcopal Church</italic> in Natchez, Mississippi plantation heir Joseph Davis\u2014whose brother Jefferson was President Taylor\u2019s son-in-law\u2014ventured into politics from Natchez from until 1832, before Owen\u2019s ideas inspired him to donate land for a Black-run cooperative colony, Davis Bend. \nIn 1834, Duncan Cameron of North Carolina assumed the presidency of the state\u2019s <italic>American Colonization Society</italic>, which freed select slaves and funded their relocation to Liberia. Some of these liberated individuals voluntarily returned to slavery. While Cameron\u2019s plantation became one of the largest with over a thousand slaves, he tried to care for poor White and Black families, educating promising slaves.\nSince Britain abolished Caribbean slavery in 1807, her slave colonies grew more sugar. As natural disasters in 1831 brought former <italic>Smyth</italic>-in-law William Manning\u2019s <italic>Manning</italic> and other West Indies traders and banks in Mauritius, the Governor granted <italic>Reid Irving</italic> a charter to incorporate the joint stock <italic>Bank of Mauritius</italic> in 1831. The bank operated under certain regulations, including a requirement for full capital subscription and regular financial reporting, and it marked one of the earliest examples of its kind. Between 1833 and 1836, Parliament emancipated slaves and bought out plantations. By 1838, slavers James Blyth\u2014a former whaler in Limehouse and Mauritius\u2014and Benjamin Greene founded <italic>Mauritius Commercial Bank</italic>, initially facilitating trade and investment in compensation claims.\nAfter Jamaica gave full equality to free Blacks in 1830\u2014followed six months later by Jews, decades before their co-religionists in Britain\u2014and freed Black slaves in 1834, over a dozen West Indies British merchant houses and <italic>West Indi</italic><italic>es</italic><italic> Planters Bank</italic> collapsed. Moses Montefiore and Nathan Rothschild secured a loan that compensated slave owners, allowing the British government to enforce the <italic>Slave Emancipation Act</italic>. Despite their objections to compensation, they accepted the terms to end slavery. While Indian and Chinese indentures replaced Black slaves, Britain de-criminalized poverty and federalized poor law administration. While wife sales and public auctions fell from a record high, they survived until the 1910s.\nBy 1834, Joseph Montefiore succeeded in liberalizing Australian interest rates and became a shareholder of the newly established <italic>Bank of Australasia</italic>.<italic> Bank of Australasia</italic> soon began buying local banks to expand across Australia. While <italic>Bank of Australasia</italic> sought a monopoly to branch to Africa, Parliament resisted. As British investors associated with <italic>National Provincial Bank of England</italic> and Edward Blount assumed control of the struggling <italic>Tamar Ban</italic>k to form <italic>Union Bank of Australia</italic> in 1837 with support from <italic>Glyn </italic>and Montefiore, <italic>New Zealand Co</italic> approached both banks in 1838 to establish a branch in their settlement. While <italic>Bank of Australasia</italic> hesitated, <italic>Union Bank</italic> became the first to establish operations in New Zealand.\nWhen the <italic>Panic of 1841</italic> destabilized the Australian sheep markets, colonial banks unable to tap British capital markets collapsed, including Joseph Montefiore\u2019s <italic>Montefiore</italic> fell into bankruptcy in Sydney and London. His <italic>Bank of Australasia</italic> soon merged with <italic>Union Bank of Australia</italic> and other banks to form what became ANZ.<italic> </italic>After Joseph returned to London, <italic>Montefiore</italic> resumed by 1844 with assistance from friends and likely <italic>Rothschild</italic> London. With the discovery of copper in South Australia, Joseph moved there and set up an import and shipping agency with his nephew. Moreover, Joseph invested heavily in copper mines, serving on several boards, including <italic>Royal South Australian Mining</italic>.\nWhile Manchester\u2019s printed cottons dominated the German market after the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, exports increased to the Low Countries and Italy before diminishing in the 1840s. As German bankers of Manchester <italic>Reiss</italic>, <italic>Baver</italic>, and <italic>Saalfeld</italic> sought to establish themselves as merchant bankers in London, <italic>Schuster</italic>, <italic>Flersheim</italic>, and <italic>Engels</italic>, father of Karl Marx\u2019s writing partner, branched to Bradford, near Leeds, to focus on worsted wool. Like <italic>Engels</italic>, <italic>Schunk Souchay</italic> built a printworks near Manchester in 1837 and a Schunk Souchay heiress married Felix Mendelssohn.\nIn 1839, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> launched operations in Liverpool, partnering with Russia-focused <italic>Mahs</italic>. The same year, <italic>Huth</italic> opened a Liverpool branch, appointing a managing partner from their South American ventures. <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Lizardi</italic>, and other London merchant banks also opened Liverpool offices. While <italic>Rothschild</italic> London focused on North American markets, diversifying their financial services, <italic>Sichel</italic> established trade connections in Australia with Montefiore cousins, and<italic> </italic><italic>Schuster</italic> expanded into Manilla and Singapore. Descended from Michael Speyer and a second cousin once removed of Frankfurt banker Benedikt Goldschmidt, Leo Schuster became Deputy-Chair of <italic>London</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Brighton</italic> RR in 1846 and established the merchant bank <italic>Schuster</italic> in London in 1855 as his family converted to Unitarianism.\nParliament also allowed coal trusts in 1836 to replace sail ships with steam power. With greater shipping competition, cotton prices inflated. As American-born EK Collins grew his New York to Liverpool cotton shipping <italic>Collins </italic><italic>Shipping</italic><italic> </italic>with <italic>Brown Shipley</italic>, Scot Arthur Anderson founded <italic>Peninsular </italic><italic>Shipping</italic><italic> </italic>to supply Iberian ports from 1837, he won a contract to link Egypt and India and became <italic>Peninsular & Oriental </italic><italic>Shipping</italic><italic> </italic>(\u201cP&O\u201d) by 1840. Since EIC monopolized Bombay, P&O linked Suez, Aden, Point de Galle, and Calcutta. \nLinking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across the Central American isthmus, the British-owned and subsidized <italic>Pacific </italic><italic>Shipping</italic><italic> </italic>opening service to the Pacific side of the Panamanian isthmus by 1840. <italic>Cunard </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> was the first service from Liverpool to Halifax and Boston, soon expanding to New York, the West Indies, and the Mediterranean with investment from <italic>Maclver</italic>, <italic>Burns</italic>, and other Glasgow merchants. With John Irving as Chair, Thomas Baring as a Director, and Thomas Masterman as Auditor, <italic>Royal Mail </italic><italic>Shipping</italic> extended her London-West Indies route to include Chagres soon after. \nWhile a former BOE agent founded <italic>Midland Bank</italic> in Birmingham, Quaker <italic>Barclay</italic>, <italic>Overend Gurney</italic>, and <italic>Masterman</italic> partners joined with Scottish <italic>Reid Irving</italic> and other investors to back<italic> Colonial Bank</italic>. <italic>Colonial Bank</italic> emerged as Britain\u2019s primary colonial bank, financing the Caribbean trade, with operations focused on Jamaica, the West Indies, and British Guiana. <italic>Colonial Bank</italic> was also closely connected to BOE. Since <italic>Reid Irving</italic>\u2019s John Reid became a BOE director in 1820, he served as Deputy Governor from 1837 to 1839 and as Governor from 1839 to 1841.\nThe same year <italic>Colonial Bank</italic> started and opened a branch on the Danish Virgin Island of Saint-Thomas in 1837, <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Saint-</italic><italic>Thomas</italic> started and appointed Aaron Wolff as President. Among the Jews of Saint-Eustatius that supplied America\u2019s revolutionaries was Moses Wolff, who married Sephardi Rebeca Levy Robles in 1794. While their son Aaron married a H\u00f6nig of the Austrian tobacco monopolists in 1814, two daughters each married a Mendes Costa in the 1820s. Since marrying, Aaron moved to Saint-Thomas where he was appointed Mayor. While <italic>Colonial Bank</italic> opened a branch in Trinidad in 1837, becoming the first bank in the country, <italic>West Indi</italic><italic>es</italic><italic> Bank</italic> followed in 1840. After the latter shuttered in 1842, <italic>Colonial Bank</italic> remained Trinidad\u2019s only commercial bank until the 20th century.\nWhile his family continued in the China trade, John Heard\u2019s nephew-in-law Isaac Story became a Cashier of <italic>Nahant Bank</italic> and his brother Joseph became Court Justice from 1811 and President of <italic>Merchants Bank</italic> in Salem. Heard\u2019s son Augustine co-founded <italic>Suffolk Bank</italic> in 1818 with other Boston Brahmins. Along with <italic>Suffolk Bank</italic> in 1818, which acted as New England\u2019s central bank, Boston Brahmins founded America\u2019s earliest <italic>trust</italic>, <italic>Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance</italic>. Since John Lowell Gardner married Elizabeth Pickering in 1759, he focused on textile commerce, His cousin Amos Adams Lawrence\u2014a relative of two presidents\u2014began his career at <italic>Suffolk Bank</italic>. \nAs Mary Russell Gardner married her cousin Francis Cabot Lowell, her sister married John Gray, a director at <italic>Massachusetts Hospital Life Insurance </italic>in the 1820s, and trustee of <italic>Provident</italic> until 1853. Mary\u2019s sister, Sarah married John\u2019s brother Horace, a director of SBUS <italic>Boston</italic> and <italic>American Insurance </italic>through the 1820s. Their brother, John Gardner, was a director of <italic>Massachusetts Bank</italic>, <italic>Shawmut Bank</italic>, and <italic>Boston Marine Insurance </italic>from the 1830s. \nWhile Philadelphians individually moved away from their Quaker faith, Boston\u2019s Brahmins shifted from Puritanism to Unitarian Congregationalism as a group. Although America elected her first Quaker Calvin Coolidge president in 1923, himself a Boston Brahmin, Unitarians included the second President, John Adams, his son John Quincy (the 6th President) as well as Fillmore and Taft later. But John Quincy Adams left the White House in 1829, federalism died in Massachusetts and no <italic>Harvard</italic> man followed until Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 and until Coolidge in 1923. \nEarly American presidents had strong ties to English royalty. For instance, George Washington traced ancestry to English nobility via his great-grandmother. While John Adams claimed descent from both John and William of England, his wife\u2019s ancestors include King Edward III and Charlemagne. Thomas Jefferson\u2019s mother descended from King Edward III and James Madison\u2019s lineage linked back to William the Conqueror. Several factors explain the prevalence of aristocratic lineage. Firstly, during the colonial period, many immigrants belonged to the gentry, who often held influential positions, such as colonial governors, officials, or wealthy landowners. Secondly, intermarriage between European nobility and gentry was common, leading to a widespread diffusion of aristocratic bloodlines. Additionally, the concept of social mobility was fluid, with younger sons of noble families seeking opportunities in trade, colonial governance, or religious leadership, further contributing to the aristocratic lineage among early American settlers.\nLike those his father and the other presidents, President John Quincy Adams emphasized qualifications and stability in government positions, exemplified by his reappointment of Joseph Nourse, who had held his post as Registrar of UST over six presidents since 1789. Similarly, for the directorship of the <italic>Mint</italic>, Adams continued the legacy by reappointing Samuel Moore, the son-in-law of Robert Patterson, whom President Jefferson had originally appointed in 1805. In the presidential election of 1828, however, the Boston Brahmin Senator of Massachusetts Daniel Webster lost to Tennessee Senator General Andrew Jackson, who had the support of free bankers, like the Polks and Roger Taney of Maryland. A Catholic member of the Southern landed aristocracy, Taney was a director of <italic>Farmers</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Bank of Maryland</italic> and <italic>Frederick County Bank of Maryland</italic> and a shareholder and counsel to <italic>Union Bank in Baltimore</italic>, and thought Biddle a monopolist.\nPresident Jackson placed a higher value on competence over formal education and advocated for frequent rotation to combat perceived corruption. Jackson\u2019s administration saw the removal of officials he referred to as \u2018rats\u2019 and a partial end to the practice of inherited office. While removing Nourse in 1829, Jackson retained another <italic>Mint</italic> director but appointed Patterson\u2019s son upon his retirement. As President Jackson appointed Taney Secretary of UST, he ordered him to remove all funds from SBUS and deposited them with <italic>Union Bank of Baltimore</italic> and other state banks. \nAfter naming Taney Attorney General and UST Secretary between 1831 and 1834, Jackson appointed him to Court in 1836, where he became the first Catholic Court Justice. However, geography was a bigger factor than religion. After Taney\u2019s death in 1864, the Court remained exclusively Protestant until the appointment of Edward White, a Catholic, in 1894. By 1838, an extended cousin-in-law of President Jackson married North Carolinian Duncan Cameron\u2019s niece.\nLikewise, <italic>Allens</italic> and their partners Clark and Cooke were linked by their Puritan heritage and descended from Emperor Charlemagne. Moses Allens\u2019 cousin once removed, Enoch Clark, became a clerk apprentice for <italic>Allens</italic> Philadelphia and married a third cousin once removed of Anson Phelps Dodge, Sarah Dodge of Wenham, in 1828. The same year, a third cousin twice removed of George Peabody\u2014whose mother was Judith Dodge of Wenham\u2014Salem merchant Joseph Peabody\u2019s daughter married Boston Brahmin John Lowell Gardner.  \nWhile her cousin twice removed was a nephew of Charlemagne-descendant Nathaniel Prime, Judith\u2019s sister wed Nathaniel Prime\u2019s fourth cousin, who was also connected closer by marriage. Likewise, Judith Dodge Peabody\u2019s fourth cousin once removed, Sarah Clark, was a second cousin once removed of David Dodge, who married the daughter of Reverend Aaron Cleveland, a descendant of Charlemagne. Since Cleveland\u2019s sister married Stephen Higginson, their daughter married Charlemagne descendant Thomas-Handasyd Perkins\u2019 brother. Likewise, Higginson\u2019s sister married Charlemagne descendant Judge John Lowell, whose other wives were a Cabot and a Russell.\nWhile David Dodge joined his uncle-in-law Stephen Higginson to found <italic>Higginson Dodge</italic> of Boston, New York, and Baltimore, the largest wholesale dry goods house before the embargo of 1807, his son William Dodge wed by 1829 the daughter of New York merchant Anson Phelps, a third cousin once removed of Comfort Sands and descendant of George Phelps, an early settler of and large landowner in Connecticut, as well as several colonial governors. Since the <italic>War of 1812</italic> devastated transatlantic trade, Phelps had purchased copper from the Jewish <italic>Hendricks</italic>. After the war, Phelps formed a partnership with Elisha Peck, who relocated to Liverpool to export cotton to Britain and import tin, copper, and other metals. Along with investing copper alloy brass production in Connecticut, Phelps obtained control of <italic>Union Bank</italic> <italic>of Dover</italic> in New Jersey.\nTwo of Phelps\u2019 other daughters married Daniel James and Josiah Stokes. Stokes was born in NY to a British emigrant. While his grandfather had been a London merchant, the Stokes family acquired significant land in England after migrating from Normandy following the Norman Conquest. Although Hendricks had shifted to tin for ships, he lost share to Phelps, who soon replaced Peck and partnered with his sons-in-law to found <italic>Phelps Dodge </italic>in New York and <italic>Phelps James</italic> in Liverpool. While Stokes died, his widow later remarried his brother James, who then became a <italic>Phelps</italic> <italic>Dodge</italic> partner.\n<italic>Grenfell</italic> was among Britain\u2019s largest copper suppliers. During the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic> and blockades, British copper demand boomed. Since copper magnate Owen Williams of North Wales, established <italic>Chester Old Bank</italic> in 1791, he joined with Pascoe Grenfell to co-found Swansea\u2019s <italic>Copper</italic> <italic>Bank Smelting </italic>in 1803. The latter then started <italic>Grenfell</italic>, which along with <italic>Vivian</italic> and a Cornwall entrepreneur, monopolized European copper. While one of Reverend Thomas Vivian\u2019s sons battled Napoleon, another managed <italic>Vivian</italic>, propelling the family into the peerage. After Grenfells\u2019 daughter married a <italic>Glyn </italic>banker in 1823, his son joined the Court of BOE in 1830, which the family directed into the 20th century, along with 1720\u2019s <italic>Royal Assurance</italic>.\nKinterlinks also helped eliminated problems. Under Governor Horsley Palmer, BOE sought to centralize note issuance, opening BOE <italic>Newcastle</italic> in 1828 and gradually tightening conditions for gold supply. As<italic> Ridley </italic>of Newcastle protested these changes to BOE through their London agent and cousins <italic>Glyn</italic>, BOE allowed <italic>Ridley</italic> to receive \u00a310,000 in gold in 1831. BOE\u2019s gold supply grew as her gold dealing monopoly <italic>Mocatta Goldsmid </italic>kinterlinked with gold and silver refiner <italic>Rapha\u00ebl </italic>in 1828 and <italic>Johnson</italic> built a London refinery for South American gold by the early 1830s. \nBy then, Peabody with Elisha\u2019s son and nephew<italic> </italic>reorganized <italic>Riggs Peabody</italic>. Since traveling to Europe in 1827, Peabody recognized a chance to sell American cotton in Lancashire, England, and believed that establishing personal connections there and handling the purchase and shipment of various dry goods would be profitable. The growing trade prompted <italic>Riggs Peabody</italic> to move from Georgetown to Baltimore. After successfully arranging a substantial loan for Baltimore in London, he opened <italic>Riggs Peabody</italic> London in 1837, where he connected with <italic>Baring</italic>, Wellington, and Queen Victoria.\nTo meet British cotton demand, Southerners pushed slavery west. Louisiana chartered land banks. Plantations secured credit using chattel slave pledges as collateral with repurchase rights. Since the French <italic>Code</italic> only protected recorded chattels, Louisiana excepted slaves in adopting it. While plantations expensed wages, they capitalized slaves for loan collateral. Since Virginia chartered the private <italic>James River & Kanawha Canal</italic> in 1785, the state took control of the project by 1823. \nIn the same year, Virginia, along with Maryland, initiated <italic>Chesapeake & Ohio Canal</italic> to run along the Potomac River from Washington, DC, to Cumberland, Maryland. Maryland funded the project by floating state bonds using<italic> Riggs Peabody</italic>. By 1836, the Riggs family partnered with William Corcoran\u2014an extended cousin-in-law of the Biddle family\u2014and founded <italic>Riggs Corcoran</italic> bank in DC. Out of London, <italic>Huth</italic> invested in <italic>Morris Canal & Banking Co</italic> bonds, New Orleans City stock, and New York debt.\nSince President Jackson allowed SBUS\u2019 charter to expire to abolish her banknote monopoly, her closure was a license for all States to incorporate more banks without SBUS exercised system oversight. As her Constitution prevented private banks, Indiana authorized a system of insured State banks in 1834 that could regulate capital ratios and dividend payouts. <italic>Indiana</italic> SB hired young lawyers to lead her branches. \nWhile his Scotch descendant father had been one of New England\u2019s largest shipowners until the <italic>War of 1812</italic>, Hugh McCulloch\u2019s mother was an aunt-in-law of Thomas-Handasyd Perkins, and traveled West after the crash, where he ultimately became a director and manager of the Fort Wayne branch by 1836. Descended from Huguenots and President George Washington\u2019s family, James Lanier\u2019s father became a planter in Tennessee and Kentucky after the military. After transitioning from law like McCulloch, Lanier served as a director of the system and branch president of <italic>Indiana</italic> SB Madison. By 1836, Indiana adopted bank deposit insurance, like New York, Vermont, and Michigan.\nBy 1831, John Mason became President of <italic>Chemical Bank</italic> and Director of BONY, his daughter had married in-laws of the Knickerbocker brothers Abraham and Jacob Schermerhorn\u2014whose parents were Joanna Livingston Cortlandt\u2019s second cousin once removed and a second cousin once removed of John Rockefeller\u2019s mother\u2014led interests in <italic>Bank of Monroe</italic>. \nWithin a year, Mason helped found and presided over <italic>New York & Harlem</italic> RR. Likewise, the Schermerhorns developed interests in<italic> Syracuse & Binghamton</italic> RR and <italic>Tonawanda</italic> RR by 1833. The Schermerhorns\u2019 sister married Rebecca Stevens, whose stepmother was a widow of Comfort Sands\u2019 brother. Her father was a New York importer and her brothers married Abby Weld, the second cousin once removed of Erastus Corning, and a daughter of former UST Secretary Albert Gallatin. Their cousin once removed married a son of Patroon Stephen Livingston Rensselaer.\nSince Ohio forbid the issuance of unauthorized money in 1816, Mason, John Astor, <italic>Prime</italic>\u2019s Nathaniel Prime, and other New Yorkers  formed <italic>Ohio Life Insurance & Trust </italic>(\u201cOLIT\u201d) to invest in the Midwest in 1834 to intermediate investment without bankruptcy law. But after Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith, a descendant of the Plymouth Howlands and Scottish aristocrats, established the priesthood structure in Ohio in 1831, the hard-money Democrat-dominated Ohio legislature rejected his bank charter application in 1836. \nIn response, Smith circumvented formal banking regulations by establishing the society as a joint stock company, <italic>Kirtland Safety Society</italic>, alongside the establishment of a newspaper. That same year, Smith supervised the construction of the Latter Day Saint-Church\u2019s inaugural temple in Kirtland and missionary efforts, including the first mission to Britain, gaining significant conversions.\nOther states prioritized public works investment over deposits. As Pennsylvania and Maryland adopted free banks, the South protected state land banks. Allowing collieries and forges in the 1830s, Virginia kept strict SB rules until 1852. While slaves mined Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky coal, Virginia\u2019s iron works did not use slaves until 1842. Although Tennessee had outlawed the inter-state slave trade in 1826, planters and merchants criticized<italic> Union Bank </italic>in Nashville for mainly lending to slave traders. In 1838, the state chartered <italic>Bank of Tennessee</italic>.\nSince the 1820s, <italic>Erie Canal</italic> fostered Upstate New York. Henry Gibson worked for a merchant, the county clerk, and as a teller at <italic>Bank of Utica</italic> before resigning after a disagreement with the cashier in 1812. That year, he partnered with Utica merchant Watts N. Sherman\u2014of a prosperous Rhode Island family and Rensselaer extended cousin-in-law\u2014married his daughter, and formed <italic>Sherman Gibson</italic> in 1813. As his daughter married a Rensselaer extended cousin by the 1830s, Gibson became President of <italic>Ontario County Bank</italic>, <italic>Auburn-Rochester</italic> RR, and <italic>Rochester-Syracuse</italic> RR. Gibson hired Watts N.\u2019s nephew Watts H. as Cashier of <italic>Ontario Bank</italic> in Canandaigua. Watts H. then became Cashier of <italic>Lexington County Bank</italic> in Geneseo until accepting Erastus Corning\u2019s invitation to be Cashier of the Rensselaer-affiliated <italic>Albany City Bank</italic> in 1834, and marrying Corning\u2019s niece, Sarah Turner, in 1835.\nErastus Corning had married fellow Boston Brahmin, Harriet Weld, whose family had been original <italic>Harvard</italic> Overseers. While the couple had five sons, only two survived to maturity and they adopted Harriet\u2019s nieces, ensuring their education and arranging marriages. Sarah\u2019s sisters married: John Schaack Pruyn, Erastus\u2019 attorney, and an officer and director of Rensselaer\u2019s <italic>Mohawk-Hudson</italic>, <italic>Utica-Schenectady</italic>, <italic>Mohawk Valley</italic>, and <italic>New York Central </italic>railroads; Chicago banker Isaac Burch; and General Robert Lenox Banks, <italic>New York Central </italic>RR\u2019s treasurer. \nErastus served as President of <italic>Utica-Schenectady</italic> RR, <italic>Committee on the Consolidation of the Central lines</italic>, and <italic>New York Central</italic> RR. Since Sarah died in 1838, Sherman married his cousin, Gibson\u2019s daughter, but continued to be close to the Cornings and remained with <italic>Albany City Bank</italic>. Another co-founder and director of <italic>Utica-Schenectady</italic> RR, Alfred Munson\u2014a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and relative of <italic>Allens</italic>\u2019 Enoch White Clark\u2014was the first President of <italic>Oneida Bank</italic>. \nSimilarly, Watts Sherman\u2019s extended cousin, Phineas Sherman, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, built a paper mill in Watertown, New York, in 1810. His son George studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1823, and practiced law, becoming a district attorney and judge before co-founding <italic>Watertown Bank & Loan</italic>. George also served as counsel and director of <italic>Jefferson County Bank</italic>, which corresponded with <italic>Prime</italic>.  Phineas\u2019 second cousin had married Gardiner Avery, a descendant of Charlemagne, whose second great uncle married the widowed great aunt of Nathaniel Prime. \nAvery was a lawyer in Burlington, Vermont, where his son became a banker. Avery\u2019s second cousin once removed, Solomon Avery, was a grantee of Chiswick, New Hampshire, and a proprietor of <italic>Susquehanna Land Co</italic>, which settled the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania after the <italic>Revolution</italic>. While Solomon married the daughter of the Reverend of New Haven, her sister wed the brother-in-law of Reverend Thomas Hooker\u2019s second great-granddaughter. Solomon\u2019s son inherited over 1,000 acres along Tunkhannock Creek and served as justice of the peace and colonel of militia. \nGlobal merchants flocked to the Port of New Orleans. Born in New Orleans in 1794, Edmond Forstall descended from a knighted English mercantile family which had moved from Ireland, to France, and Martinique, mixing with French and Spanish colonial officials along the way. A sugar plantation farmer by age 24, Forstall served on the <italic>Louisiana </italic>SB\u2019s board in 1818 and pioneered steam mills by the 1820s. After the governor elected Forstall became controller of Louisiana\u2019s<italic> </italic>first plantation banks, <italic>Consolidated Association Bank, </italic>by 1829 in New Orleans, he met <italic>Baring</italic>, who was searching for a New Orleans agent. \nAs Louisiana based her pledge law on the French <italic>Code</italic>, <italic>Consolidated</italic> financed stock subscriptions with loans secured by mortgages on stockholders\u2019 real estate. However, Forstall\u2019s connections to <italic>Baring</italic> made him a frequent target for anti-foreign sentiments, and he was forced out as comptroller of the Consolidated Association Bank in 1830. Still, Forstall became associated with new subscription debt-funded plantation banks that started in Louisiana. \nAfter associating with a Liverpool firm, Forstall became the New Orleans branch of the Paris- and London-based <italic>Lizardi</italic>, which took over Mexico\u2019s foreign financial agency from <italic>Baring</italic> by 1835. The Basque were long prominent in Louisiana. After Jean Echevarria, a Basque arrived in Spanish Louisiana in 1781, he bought a Mississippi River plantation from a fellow Basque for slave running and became New Orleans\u2019s first banker. Basque bankers continued under American sovereignty. Accused of being a revolutionary sympathizer, the Basque Lizardi family Veracruz for New Orleans in 1833 and started <italic>Lizardi</italic>.\nOne of the largest cotton consigners out of New Orleans was <italic>Schiff Rochelle</italic>. From Frankfurt, Hart Schiff moved to New Orleans and partnered with Rochelle. <italic>Schiff Rochelle</italic>\u2019s main cotton factor was Frankfurt-born Samuel Hermann, who married a local Baptist. After Schiff\u2019s partner served as godfather at the baptism of Hermann\u2019s second son in, 1810, Hermann acted as a witness at Schiff\u2019s wedding in 1813. While Hermann acted as a broker for planters who needed advances on their future crops, and arranged for shipments of merchandise to them, he took care of Schiff\u2019s business when he out of town. \nHermann and his brothers held key positions in various institutions. In 1832, one brother was nominated for <italic>New Orleans</italic> <italic>City Bank</italic> board, and from 1834 to 1836, he served as a director of <italic>New Orleans Gas Light & Banking Co</italic>. Another brother served on the boards of <italic>Carrollton Bank</italic> and <italic>Orleans </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>. The Hermanns also partnered with brothers Samuel and Joachim Kohn of Prague, both were directors of <italic>Louisiana State Marine & Fire Insurance Co </italic>in 1836.\nWithout relatives moving to New Orleans and partnering like Schiff, Emily Samuel Cohen-Barent, a Katz descendant sister-in-law of Nathan Rothschild and his Goldsmid and Montefiore in-law stockbroker <italic>Wagg</italic>, moved to New York, where she married Solomon Joseph after 1835. Solomon\u2019s brother Joseph and their parents emigrated from Frankfurt. <italic>Rothschild</italic> London then partnered with <italic>Joseph</italic> to use <italic>Hermann</italic>. To fund <italic>Hermann</italic>, both <italic>Schiff Rochelle</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> used MMBU out of London. Likewise, <italic>Joseph</italic> arranged <italic>Rothschild</italic> London to finance New York\u2019s canal. As Nathan traveled to Frankfurt for his son Lionel\u2019s wedding to the daughter of his brother Karl, the head of <italic>Rothschild</italic> Naples, he passed away in 1836. Subsequently, Lionel assumed control of <italic>Rothschild</italic> London branch. \nWith SBUS left without a charter, Pennsylvania chartered Biddle\u2019s <italic>Bank of the United States </italic>(\u201cBUSP\u201d) to buy equity from June 1836. However, tensions flared between BOE and American banks over MMBU. Despite these challenges, BUSP strove to bolster funds for <italic>Baring</italic>, including selling bank shares and arranging bond sales, alongside investments in cotton. After BUSP allowed <italic>Baring</italic> to sell 10,000 shares, <italic>Baring</italic> proposed to rediscount some of the objectional acceptances BOE held, yet only those drawn by SBUS were forwarded. Violating <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s regulations, BUSP established a secondary account in London with <italic>Huth</italic>. Trust among British counterparts eroded more as BUSP failed to ship specie. <italic>Prime</italic>, despite facing criticism for high commissions, sustained an active exchange account, solidifying their value to <italic>Baring</italic>.\nContinuing to hike interest rates, BOE restricted discounts by yearend. Against <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s order, <italic>Joseph</italic> funded <italic>Hermann</italic>. After an insider tip that New Orleans banks would not aid <italic>Hermann</italic>, <italic>Joseph</italic> shuttered even as BUSP raised MMBU for <italic>Hermann</italic> via <italic>Baring</italic>. So, <italic>Hermann</italic>, <italic>Kohn</italic>, and other New Orleans bankers were pulled into bankruptcy. After apprenticing at <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt, Sephardi descendant of the wealthiest Court factors of Alzey of the Rhineland, August Belmont stopped in New York enroute to Cuba. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris bade Belmont to recover assets, Belmont could not without bankruptcy law. Still, <italic>Rothschild</italic> hired Belmont to replace <italic>Joseph</italic>. \nWith the fall in cotton prices, <italic>Phelps</italic> <italic>James</italic> of Liverpool struggled to sell cotton to purchase tin, forcing <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> of New York to suspend payments and raise capital from partners. In May 1837, banks across America suspended specie payments until the summer of 1838, resulting in economic depression, unemployment, and commodity price decline. As courts tied up assets, even New England\u2019s banks with central banked under <italic>Suffolk Bank</italic> defaulted, leading to numerous bankruptcies, before eventually resuming redemption a year later. And north in Quebec, where <italic>Hart</italic> and other private bankers soon circulated paper credit.<italic> </italic>And <italic>Franklin Armfield</italic> finished dissolving her inter-state slave trade monopoly.\n<italic>Astor</italic>-affiliate and <italic>Prime</italic> banker James King alleviated the <italic>Panic of 1837 </italic>by convincing BOE to end suspension and received a $5 million loan. Although SBUS had cleared interstate credit bills in the 1820s, lawyers questioned the legality of pledged negotiable paper as trade credit collateral. As the <italic>Constitution</italic> prohibits states from impairing contracts, bankers endorsed this paper to assuring liability. And in Tennessee, as <italic>Yeatman</italic> of Nashville suspended, other public depositories falsified their books to hide their peril. While, Alabama\u2019s public bank financed state expenses in place of taxes in the 1820s, the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic> forced this bank to suspend gold payouts, leading Alabama to make the banks\u2019 bills legal tender.\nWhile King\u2019s daughter married William Duer\u2019s grandson (nephew of former SBUS <italic>New Orleans</italic> President Beverley Chew) and King\u2019s brother-in-law Archibald Gracie became the President of <italic>Baring</italic> Mobile in Alabama, <italic>Brown</italic> opened branches in Mobile and New Orleans. Serving as counsel for BOE and SBUS, Richard Blatchford became receiver for several failed state banks amidst the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>. His friend William Seward helped form the Republican party and was elected Governor of New York in 1839, hiring Blatchford\u2019s son as his secretary, and subsequently organizing law firm<italic> </italic><italic>Blatchford Seward</italic>. \nIn Ohio, amidst the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>, Mormon Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s <italic>Kirtland Safety Society</italic> encountered immediate challenges, leading to the suspension of specie payments within a month and subsequent closure in November 1837. In 1837, Warren Parrish, accused of embezzlement from the Church\u2019s bank, established the Church of Christ in Kirtland, Ohio, challenging Smith\u2019s leadership. Despite heavy personal investment, Smith transferred his financial interests to others by 1843. Criticized for his polygamy, Joseph Smith was assassinated in 1844, and Brigham Young married Smith\u2019s wife.\nAs the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic> forced <italic>Allens</italic> to liquidate, Enoch Clark<italic> </italic>and his brother-in-law Edward Dodge started <italic>Clark</italic>. Instead of on-demand convertibility, <italic>Clark</italic>\u2019s notes were redeemable in gold at 75%. They faced competition from other \u2018wild cat\u2019 banks <italic>dollar</italic> dealers. \nBorn in Austria in 1792, Francis Drexel received a Catholic education before moving to America after the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>. By 1821, he married the Catholic daughter of a Philadelphia merchant from a largely Quaker family. After traveling to Mexico in 1837, Francis transitioned to a new career as a banker at the age of 46. He opened a brokerage office in Louisville, Kentucky, dealing with local \u2018wild cat\u2019 <italic>dollars</italic> and \u2018uncurrent money.\u2019 Due to the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>, paper money from state banks had replaced hard currency. His success led him back to return to Philadelphia a year later, where he founded <italic>Drexel</italic> with his sons Anthony and Francis who remained Catholic. \nHaving exempted three-month debt from usury in 1833, Britain expanded it to 12 months in 1837. But New York criminalized it. Since suspending gold payouts, BUSP bought New Jersey\u2019s <italic>Morris Canal & Banking Co</italic>\u2014now under the leadership of Biddle\u2019s brother\u2014using MMBU and stabilized cotton prices by investing in Louisiana and Mississippi banks and loans. <italic>Baring</italic> underestimated the forthcoming volume of securities to be created by states, municipalities, and chartered companies, as well as British investors\u2019 willingness to buy them. Competition came from many directions. \nWhile BUSP competed fiercely,<italic> Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s reputation was undamaged. As <italic>Lizardi</italic> and <italic>Huth</italic> recovered from losses, the latter established a Liverpool branch for its cotton finance business and negotiated a deal with <italic>Bank of Missouri</italic> for the sale of bonds. <italic>Speyer</italic> branched to New York and Baltimore merchant George Peabody transitioned to banking in London as <italic>Reid Irving</italic>, <italic>Magniac </italic><italic>Smyth</italic>, and others refocused on America. \nInstead of a central bank, Congress held public funds in <italic>Sub Treasuries </italic>(\u201cSUST\u201d) under UST. Without taxes, charter dividends paid state debts until 1837. Starting with banks, New York replaced monopoly charters with limited liability free incorporation. So did other states, incorporating partnerships. As New York State faced the threat of repudiating her debt and enacted banking reform in 1838, <italic>Prime</italic>, Jonathan Sturges\u2014born to a Connecticut representative from the earliest Congresses and a state court judge, and a fourth cousin once removed of Russ Sturgis\u2014, and others organized <italic>Bank of Commerce</italic> in 1839 to expand <italic>Erie Canal</italic>. \nThe first President was John Ledyard Stevens, whose mother was a widow of Comfort Sands\u2019 brother. While John married Abby Weld, the second cousin once removed of Erastus Corning, his brother married the daughter of former UST Secretary Albert Gallatin, and his sister married a Schermerhorn. Their cousin once removed married a son of Patroon Stephen Livingston Rensselaer.\nIn 1839, the Court invalidated Alabama\u2019s bills against BUSP. As BUSP pulled funding, cotton deflated, leading to the <italic>Panic of 1839</italic> as <italic>Morris Canal & Banking Co</italic> defaulted. <italic>Riggs</italic> <italic>Peabody </italic>lost control of the Ohio River canal to <italic>Baring.</italic> Since gaining prominence himself as a financier in London, George Peabody resigned from <italic>Riggs</italic> <italic>Peabody </italic>to form <italic>Peabody</italic>. Instead of collieries, Virginia subsidized canals for planters. \n<italic>Citi</italic> only survived by selling herself to Astor. As <italic>Hottinguer</italic> withdrew, <italic>Rothschild </italic>Paris bought MMBU but lost as BUSP suspended gold payouts, and note banknote holders ran in the South and Northwest. In London,<italic> Peabody</italic> soon affiliated with <italic>Prime</italic>\u2019s King cousin-in-laws of <italic>Wetmore Cryder</italic> <italic>Alsop</italic>, with connections in Chile, Canton, and New York. \nWhile <italic>Rothschild</italic> refused to aid BOE in the <italic>Panic of 1839</italic>, but <italic>Baring</italic> did. Since working with Thomas Perkins and marrying Russ Sturgis\u2019 cousin in 1826, Joshua Bates founded <italic>Baring</italic> Boston to link <italic>Baring</italic> with Boston Brahmin Asia trader <italic>Russell</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic> partnered with <italic>Blake</italic> in Boston as her securities broker. Along with working with <italic>Peabody</italic>, <italic>Blake</italic>\u2019s Partner kinterlinked with Quaker SBUS banker Jacob Barker by 1841. Likewise, Barker\u2019s son married Sarah Wharton, whose Quaker grandfather had wed Abraham Redwood\u2019s granddaughter, a <italic>Hottinguer</italic> and <italic>Baring </italic>cousin, and great granduncle had married a <italic>Lloyd</italic> cousin.\nIn Mississippi, meanwhile, Stephen Duncan prospered. Pennsylvania-born Duncan earned a medical degree at <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> before moving to Natchez, Mississippi, in 1808. His maternal uncle, Samuel Postlethwaite, was a member of the \u2018Natchez Nabobs\u2019 elite and President of <italic>Mississippi </italic>SB, the state\u2019s primary financial institution until 1833. After Postlethwaite\u2019s passing in 1825, Duncan assumed his role as the bank\u2019s President. Duncan became one of the South\u2019s largest slave owners, overseeing over 2,200 men, women, and children on over fifteen cotton and sugar plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana. Additionally, he invested in steamboat enterprises and played an active role in establishing and managing several Mississippi banks. \nDuncan supported high tariffs and promoted the presidential campaigns of John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Still, President Jackson deposited funds with Duncan\u2019s bank after closing SBUS. In 1833, Duncan\u2019s <italic>Mississippi </italic>SB lost her monopoly, While the state chartered several improvement and banks, only three of banks operated by 1837: <italic>West Feliciana RR & Banking </italic>at Woodville, <italic>Commercial & RR Bank of Vicksburg</italic>, and <italic>Agricultural Bank</italic>, which Duncan branched from <italic>Mississippi </italic>SB. Biddle\u2019s BUSP actively supported Mississippi\u2019s projects and invested in the stock issues of <italic>West Feliciana</italic> RR and various other ventures.\nAfter a Louisiana bank issued MMBU, the legislature delegalized it in 1841. Like Alabama, Louisiana limited debt prisons. Mississippi held slave imports unconstitutional in 1832, but import did not stop. As Louisiana land banks collapsed in the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>, Mississippi voided slave debts retroactively back to 1833. By 1841, the Court held that Mississippi impaired contracts and Louisiana legalized bearer debts. Without bankruptcy alternatives, eight more states defaulted in 1841, including Pennsylvania. As British bankers sought to reorg laws, <italic>Huth</italic>\u2019s Daniel Meinertzhagen managed to resolve claims in Florida and Texas. \nSince Forstall lost his bank posts because of his connections to <italic>Lizardi</italic>, he led Louisianan bank reform in 1842. By 1843, <italic>Lizardi</italic> exited banking as <italic>Baring</italic> stopped accepting her paper. Possibly having worked with <italic>Lizardi</italic>, Katz-cousin Lazard brothers and cousin Alexandre Weill moved to Louisiana in the 1840s with Marc Meyer, a descendant of an important Napoleonic French rabbi. Likewise, Bavaria immigrant Joseph Seligman worked as a cashier for <italic>Lehigh</italic> RR in Pennsylvania before starting <italic>Seligman</italic> to peddle. As his brothers immigrated to join him, one opened a dry goods store in New York with an in-law\u2014where he befriended Ulysses Grant\u2014others peddled in Alabama and Missouri by 1843. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1841</italic>, deposit insurance did not work in New York, Vermont, or Michigan, but it did work in Indiana\u2019s supervised branching model. In the Mississippi Valley, only <italic>Indiana</italic> SB under the leadership of Hugh McCulloch survived.As states set debt limits\u2014like Illinois\u2019 $50,000\u2014investment deflated. Without bank reform, cotton deflation spread to Southern land bank notes. Facing bill defaults and fraud from <italic>Agricultural Bank</italic>, Stephen Duncan led <italic>Mississippi </italic>SB until her liquidation in 1844. While initially siding with the South during the <italic>Civil War</italic>, he became a Unionist, and relocating to New York.\nWhen the Whigs regained control\u2014and with British creditor advocacy\u2014Congress enacted . Although <italic>Joseph</italic> had little left then for <italic>Belmont</italic>, BA1841 liquidated banks and factors. While Republicans repealed SUST, Democrats voted <italic>Fiscal National Bank</italic>. By 1843, Democrats repealed it and re-established SUST, resuming state insolvency. The following year, <italic>Riggs Corcoran</italic> became the federal government\u2019s only depository in DC and took over SBUS\u2019 former assets.\nMeanwhile, around a tenth of free Black and mixed-race individuals amassed considerable wealth, particularly in the South. These individuals often owned property and engaged in the slave economy, including 242 planters who held over 20 slaves in 1850. Among the 21 wealthiest Black Americans, five were large planters in Louisiana, primarily from sugar and cotton production. By 1860, free Blacks in New Orleans accounted for 20% of the city\u2019s taxable assets. \nThis Black wealth was limited neither to the South nor only to men. While Mary Pleasant\u2019s origins are debated, she owned a boardinghouse, restaurant, employment agency, and laundries in San Francisco by 1870. After moving to San Francisco in 1849, Pleasant parlayed her inheritance from her husband to build her fortune. She claimed to support John Brown\u2019s 1859 raid on Harper\u2019s Ferry, though evidence for this is unclear. One of Louisiana\u2019s wealthiest Black women was Eulalie Macarty. In New Orleans, she owned 32 slaves and ran a successful mercantile business selling French-imported goods by 1830. She expanded her sales territory using her slaves and operated a depot in Plaquemines Parish for trade to Attakaps. By the 1840s, her business, including banking and discounting notes. \nAs interracial marriage was illegal in every state, Louisiana allowed \u2018placage\u2019, where White men financially supported Black women. Immigrants from the Caribbean with Black spouses also played a role. To protect their property and social standing, the Ellisons, Donatos, and other free Blacks intermarried across the Lower South, usually choosing spouses based on economic position, cultural status, and mixed-blood ancestry. Born to a French father and a mulatto mother related to the Donato family, Norbert Rillieux invented a more efficient sugar-refining process, making sugar production more profitable. While the Rillieux parlayed this technology into one of Louisiana\u2019s largest plantations in the 1820s, they sold in 1833, when Norbert joined banker Edmund Forstall\u2019s New Orleans sugar refinery. \nUnlike most American Blacks, the Dibbles migrated to South Carolina as merchants of royal lineage and kinterlinked with Bonds Conway, who sold ginger beer and carpentry skills until buying his freedom from slavery in 1793. After buying property, Conway later became one of Charleston\u2019s earliest black storeowners. But decades later in 1860, only 197 out of Charleston\u2019s 8,038 Blacks were free. The Conways linked the Dibble and Vaughan families. When a son of the warrior Egba family and relative of Yoruba chief was taken captive and brought to South Carolina in 1805, a Camden planter named him Scipio Vaughan. \nScipio later married a Cherokee woman and, on his deathbed, urged his sons to return to their ancestral homeland in Yorubaland. In the 1850s, the sons bought their freedom with support from <italic>American Colonization Society</italic> and sailed for Liberia. James migrated to Yorubaland, establishing the first Baptist church in Nigeria and became a merchant, trading in commodities such as palm oil, coconuts, and ivory by the 1880s. The Vaughans and their extended family were one of the few American Black clans to maintain international contact.\nAccumulating notes secured by mortgages since the 1830s, New Orleans mulatto Martin Donato served as a private banker to local White planters and owned 88 slaves at the time of his death in 1848. As freed slave William Ellison\u2019s owned a plantation with over 60 slaves in South Carolina, pockets of freed and mixed Blacks continued to thrive as sailing innovators, lumber merchants, barbers, and as plantation owning farmer-ranchers, Virginia threatened to enslave free Blacks. Although Southern manufacturers favored indentured Blacks, slaves replaced apprenticeships, and partible inheritance shrank land plots. While courts maintained broad property rights for poor Whites to hunt, Virginia threatened to enslave free Blacks.\nSince suspending specie payments during the <italic>Panic of 1839</italic>, New Orleans\u2019 <italic>Citizens</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Bank</italic> had been unable to resume operations within the legislatively prescribed timeframe, leaving it vulnerable to compulsory liquidation under unfavorable conditions. One of <italic>Citizens</italic><italic>\u2019</italic> advocates was Judah Mendes Benjamin. Born to Sephardi of Saint-Eustatius and the British West Indies, he moved to New Orleans, where he married a French Catholic and partnered with Thomas Slidell in law during the 1830s. \nAs their legal partnership thrived, Benjamin bought a plantation\u2014alongside other Jewish planters\u2014and entered Louisiana\u2019s legislature. New York-born Slidell had migrated to New Orleans a decade earlier and became a lawyer before marrying into the prominent French-mulatto family. Within a few years, familial ties grew stronger as Slidell\u2019s sister Jane married Redwood cousin Commodore Matthew Perry of Rhode Island, Benjamin and Slidell\u2019s brother, John, secured seats in the Senate, with Benjamin becoming the first observant Jew there. No Jews, not even Benjamin, were principal spokesmen at proslavery Southern conventions.  (Commodore Perry was a cousin of <italic>Perry Lane</italic>, the foremost trader between Chesapeake and London.)\nGenerally, Northern senatorships were more competitive. Since President Washington formed a Senate that would act as a \u201csaucer cooling tea\u201d of to create a Senate capable of balancing majority will and executive power, Southern senators were less likely than their northern counterparts to be voted up or out, and so developed a seniority grip of the Senate, chairing committees like Appropriations, Foreign Relations, and Finance, wielded significant influence over funding decisions and legislative agendas. This influence was bolstered by the caliber and commitment of Southern senators, who viewed serving in the Senate as the highest attainable political position in the region.\nAs Cameron Duncan\u2019s family influence extended from North Carolina into Alabama and Mississippi, few high caste Jews engaged in South\u2019s plantations amidst continuing discrimination. Since Moses Mordecai immigrated from Bonn through Britain to Philadelphia during the 1760s, he died in 1781, and his widow married an uncle of Baltimore industrialist Jacob Cohen. Mordecai\u2019s American born son Jacob wed Rebecca Myers, who was David Franks\u2019 first cousin thrice removed, Benjamin Mendes Seixas\u2019 second cousin, and Moses Hay\u2019s niece-in-law. After clerking for David Franks in Philadelphia and several unsuccessful years in New York, Jacob Mordecai and his family migrated to North Carolina\u2019s eastern plantation district in 1787. \nOpening a store in Warrenton, the Mordecais became the town\u2019s only Jews. While one of Jacob Mordecai\u2019s daughters married Jewish Gratz Hays in 1836, most converted, and wed Christians. After his son George Mordecai succeeded Duncan Cameron as President of <italic>North Carolina </italic>SB in 1849, George married Cameron\u2019s daughter over her father\u2019s objection of \u2018domestic\u2019 reasons shortly after his death in 1853. \nThe Mordecai also connected with South Carolina\u2019s banking systems. After President Jackson allowed SBUS\u2019 charter to expire, SBUS <italic>Charleston</italic> evolved into <italic>Bank of Charleston</italic>. Back in 1815, Moses Seixas of New York kinterlinked with Philip Cohen\u2014a grandnephew of Moses Hays and second cousin twice removed of David Franks\u2014connected generations of Jewish bankers of Charleston. By that time, Cohen\u2019s brother-in-law Myer Moses served as director of <italic>Planters & Mechanics Bank</italic>. In 1825, Cohen\u2019s brother-in-law Joshua Lazarus presided over <italic>Cheraw Bank</italic>. \nAnother brother-in-law, Aaron Moise, was Cashier of <italic>Bank of South Carolina</italic> and as assistant and transfer clerk at <italic>Bank of Charleston</italic> (1837\u201351); his son, Aaron II, served as assistant cashier at <italic>Bank of Charleston</italic> (1836\u201352). Cohen\u2019s son Melvin served as director of <italic>Bank of the State of South Carolina</italic> (1849\u201355). Cohen\u2019s nephew-in-law Abraham Tobias was a director of <italic>Union Bank of South Carolina</italic> (1835\u201356). Cohen's wife\u2019s nephew-in-law and Tobias\u2019 step-nephew, David Levy, served as director of <italic>SouthWestern Railroad Bank </italic>from 1843 to 1846.\nMeanwhile, the frontier continued to develop. Born to a French-Canadian army officer near Quebec in 1767, Pierre Menard traded fur and represented the government in relations with Native Americans. After developing a trading post out of Illinois Territory, he was appointed a justice and member of the court of common pleas in 1795, and, later, lieutenant colonel of militia, American sub-agent of Native American affairs, and treaty commissioner. As Illinois became a state in 1818, Menard was elected lieutenant-governor. Menard\u2019s daughter married Irish-born Hugh Maxwell, a prominent merchant and a planter. \nIn 1821, Basque descendant Spanish General Agustin Iturbide led a revolt and named himself Emperor of Mexico. Although Iturbide chartered <italic>Banco Nacional de Texas </italic>to issue paper money backed by specie shipments to pay Mexican troops in San Antonio, the plan ultimately failed. But American settlers still entered. Descended from Connecticut puritans, Stephen Austin invested in mining ventures in Missouri and Arkansas before receiving an empresario for Texas from the Spanish Crown in 1820. Through large land grants, empresarios facilitated settlement in Texas to bolster its population and fortify against American expansion. From 1821, Austin negotiated land deals with Native Americans groups, promoting commerce and slavery. \nBy 1824, Austin hired Samuel Williams as his colonial secretary and partner. Rhode Island-born Williams descended from a family deeply rooted in American history. His ancestors included a signer of the <italic>Declaration of Independence</italic> and a president of <italic>Yale</italic>. He worked in his uncle\u2019s countinghouse in Baltimore and later represented an American shipping house in Buenos Aires for two years until serving as a private secretary to General Andrew Jackson in New Orleans. Two years later, Samuel Williams\u2019 sister married Samuel Saint-John, whose great-grandfather had co-founded Ridgefield, Connecticut. \nAround the same time, Kentucky-born Thomas McKinney traded across Missouri and Louisiana. From 1833, McKinney partnered with Samuel Williams and his national network of banking connections to trade cotton and slaves. In early 1835, Williams\u2019 brother-in-law Samuel Saint-John\u2019s cousin Newton of New York moved to Mobile and married the niece of William Bibb, the Territorial Governor and first State Governor of Alabama. \nAs Samuel Williams secured a charter for <italic>Banco de Commercia & Agricultura</italic>, Texas declared independence from Mexico in late 1835 with funding from Samuel Saint-John. As Williams encountered difficulties in raising the required capital, Texas advanced the bank\u2019s establishment, but progress faltered with the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>. Nevertheless, <italic>McKinney Williams</italic> grew into the largest merchant bank, discounting IOUs from farmers to merchants, as his brother-in-law Newton Saint-John of Mobile became a prominent planter and banker of <italic>Saint-</italic><italic>John Powers</italic>, corresponding with <italic>Belmont</italic>.\nOn the southern bank of the Rio Grande River between Texas and Mexico, the population of Matamoros grew from 2,000 in 1820 to 16,000 in 1837. Among the merchants, many had been French agents in New Orleans. Others were Germans, Italians, and Americans. Since Colonel Manuel Yturria of an old Basque family arrived in the area with a land grant from the King of Spain, he oversaw the customs house in Matamoros since 1829. From 1842, Manuel\u2019s son Francisco became a clerk with Charles Stillman, a descendant of a prominent Cromwell supporter who fled the Restoration in England. In 1836, Stillman migrated from Connecticut and married an extended cousin-in-law of the Saint-John family in 1837.\nBut much of the lands west of the Mississippi remained frontier. In 1834, George Smit arrived in Chicago from Scotland but returned to Scotland a year later and formed <italic>Scottish Illinois Land Investment Co</italic>. In 1839, Smit and fellow Scots secured a Wisconsin charter by replicating <italic>Chicago Marine & Fire Insurance Co</italic>,  naming her <italic>Wisconsin Marine & Fire Insurance Co</italic>. While holding land in Galena, Illinois, from the 1840s, <italic>Clark</italic> invested in various land plots, including future Clark Street in Chicago. <italic>Clark</italic> also made fellow Puritan, and son of a congressman, Jay Cooke a partner in 1842. \nAfter Texas declared its independence from Mexico in 1835, New Mexico revolted in 1837 and demanded increased regional authority. As New Mexico\u2019s new governor had appointed French-Canadian merchant Sieur Beaubien a judge of the territorial Court in 1841, Beaubien\u2019s daughter married Lucien Menard Maxwell\u2014a son of Hugh Maxwell and Pierre Menard\u2019s daughter\u2014in 1844 and Beaubien entrusted him with the management of his enterprises. Through inheritance and purchases, Maxwell acquired control of a vast land grant. \nLikewise, Jewish traders like Albert Speyer became active in Santa F\u00e9. After Eugene Leitensdorfer started a dry goods store Solomon Spiegelberg, immigrated from Westphalia to join him by 1844. After Leitensdorfer failed, Spiegelberg took over. In the <italic>Mexican American War</italic> of 1847, <italic>Spiegelberg</italic> supplied the Army and <italic>Bureau of Native American Affairs</italic> with corn, coffee, salt, sugar, and blankets for the Navajo and Apache while <italic>Clark</italic> led financing <italic>Drexel</italic>, <italic>Riggs </italic><italic>Corcoran</italic>, and <italic>Belmont</italic> of UST until Congress annexed California and other territories. While George Peabody had resigned from <italic>Riggs</italic> <italic>Peabody </italic>to form <italic>Peabody</italic> after the <italic>Panic of 1839</italic>. <italic>Riggs Corcoran</italic> became the federal government\u2019s only depository in DC after the <italic>Panic of 1844</italic>.\nIn 1845, Texas\u2019 constitution banned state banks. Violating this law, private bankers introduced private paper currency that gained popularity since Texas farmers and merchants traded written IOUs, which could be discounted at banks. Shortly before the <italic>Mexican American War</italic>, Samuel Williams\u2019<italic> Banco de Comercio & Agricultura</italic> from 1835 began operations and funded steamships out of Galveston, Texas, which soon dominated the Gulf. \nLikewise, Samuel Williams\u2019 brother-in-law Newton Saint-John of <italic>Saint-</italic><italic>John Powers</italic> in Mobile corresponded with <italic>Belmont.</italic><italic> </italic>As extended Saint-John cousin-in-law Charles Stillman established Brownsville, Texas, in 1848, Francisco Yturria relocated from Matamoros to Brownsville under the guardianship of Stillman. After Yturria founded a family bank in Brownsville and married a land-grant heiress in 1853, he linked Mexico and America as the primary private banker south of San Antonio.\nStirred by British shipping advances and the <italic>Mexican American War</italic>, America fostered mail service. William Harnden began as a conductor with <italic>Boston & Worcester</italic> RR. In 1839, he launched <italic>Harnden Express</italic>, a paid delivery service between Boston and New York. Demand grew in 1840 when the new <italic>Cunard</italic> steamship line opened between Liverpool and Boston, prompting Harnden to expand to Philadelphia, Albany, and eventually London and Paris. For this, he hired. Henry Wells was born in Thetford, Vermont, to Presbyterian Reverend Shipley Wells, who was the brother-in-law of Reverend John Pierpont\u2019s second cousin, third cousin of Anson Phelps\u2019 wife, fourth cousin once removed of Enoch White Clark, and nephew of Reverend John Cotton\u2019s niece-in-law. \nBy 1843, Wells partnered with Knickerbocker Crawford Livingston and George Pomeroy, a descendant of Reverend John Cotton\u2019s cousin-in-law, to establish <italic>Livingston</italic> <italic>Wells Pomeroy Express</italic> in 1843, connecting Albany and Buffalo. <italic>Wells</italic> grew rapidly by offering reduced postage rates of 6 cents per letter compared to the government\u2019s higher charges. In 1844, he opened an express line from Buffalo to Detroit, with messenger William Fargo, who married a third cousin once removed of Salem merchant Joseph Peabody\u2019s daughter-in-law, connected to the Boston Brahmin Lowell and Gardner families. \nWhile Harnden died in 1845, <italic>Wells</italic> faced more competition. With British shipping advances in the Atlantic and Pacific and the <italic>Mexican American War</italic> on the one hand, the federal government pushed private mail delivers like<italic> Adam</italic><italic>s</italic><italic> Express</italic>\u2014owned by Alvin Adams, former President John Adams\u2019 third cousin twice removed\u2014out of business by preventing fees in 1845, leading<italic> </italic><italic>Adam</italic><italic>s</italic> to acquire <italic>Harnden Express</italic><italic> </italic>and compete with <italic>Wells</italic>.\nLikewise, British shipping advances and the <italic>Mexican American War</italic> spurred American attention to the Central American transit. Since Charles Morgan\u2014a distant Morgan cousin who married Junius Morgan\u2019s fourth cousin\u2014linking New Orleans and Texas ports via <italic>Southern Steamship </italic>in the 1830s, expanded his fleet with Texan independence. By 1847, Congress authorized the Postmaster General and the Secretary of the Navy to contract separately for American ocean mail routes. \nUnder a Navy contract,<italic> US Mail Steamship</italic> began dispatching vessels from New York to New Orleans and Chagres in late 1848. Similarly, with investment from shipbuilder Charles Webb, who descended from Reverend John Cotton\u2019s cousin-in-law, New York chartered <italic>Pacific Mail Steamship</italic> established a Panama-San Francisco route by 1849 in competition with <italic>Southern Steamship</italic>. Concurrently, <italic>Collins</italic> <italic>Mail Steamship</italic> established a New York to Liverpool line. However, these carriers had uncertain futures until the discovery of gold in California. \nRunning <italic>Bank of Rhode Island</italic> for two generations, Newport\u2019s Clarkes repurposed their whaling ships to transport gold from San Francisco around Cape Horn. That year, Britain\u2019s Parliament repealed the <italic>Navigation Acts</italic> and opened British colonial shipping runs to foreign competition. To avoid a rate war, <italic>Cunard</italic> and<italic> Collins </italic>shippers agreed to minimum rates and revenue pooling and allocation by 1850. Without a canal, the first transcontinental railroad, <italic>Panama</italic> RR, linked the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans faster than a sea route. By 1854, <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> Partner William Dodge II married the daughter of <italic>Panama</italic> RR\u2019s President.\nSince the 1830s, <italic>Rothschild</italic> had controlled the Spanish Almaden and Idria, monopolizing mercury, essential for refining precious metals. In 1845, the discovery of mercury in California set the stage for the rapid development of the New Almaden Mine. As a Scot and Irishman who had assimilated into Colonial Spanish and became agents of <italic>Hudson Bay</italic>, took over New Almaden and commenced production in 1850, fueling the <italic>California Gold Rush</italic>, which remained the largest producer amid other discoveries. \nFor decades California mercury was second only to gold in value of output and supplied to across Pacific Rim, with exports reaching markets in Latin America, Hawaii, and China. A year after <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s American agent August Belmont married the daughter of Jane Slidell and Commodore Matthew Perry of Rhode Island and in 1851, August Belmont\u2019s cousin married her cousin Ludwig Bischoffsheim Bamberger, Louis Bischoffsheim\u2019s nephew.\nWhile the <italic>California</italic> <italic>Gold Rush </italic>attracted mining labor from across the world, it faced competition from the <italic>Australian Gold Rush</italic> starting with finds in New South Wales and Victoria in 1851, and subsequent discoveries of extensive deposits in Victoria, including Mount Alexander, Ballarat, and Bendigo. Joseph Montefiore became <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Australia agent. By 1853, <italic>Rothschild</italic> secured a strategic lease on <italic>Royal Mint Refinery </italic>in London in 1852, likely driven by the substantial gold flow from Victoria, which more than doubled the existing influx from California. For the next century, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s <italic>Royal Mint Refinery </italic>split refining with <italic>Johnson </italic>and <italic>Rapha\u00ebl</italic>.\nSince 1849, California\u2019s Constitution prohibited the creation circulating credit as money. Gold discoveries ensured a plentiful money supply (including private coinage until 1864.) Miners, remitting money had no choice but to buy exchange notes with gold but\u2014without security that the note issuing exchange dealer would pay the correspondent banks\u2014merchants shipped gold. The discovery of gold in California led to many profitable business opportunities. After years of international travel, <italic>Rothschild </italic>London\u2019s cousin and agent <italic>Davidzon</italic> settled in San Francisco within months of gold rumors. \nLikewise, transnational mail delivery and money transfer services consolidated. As William Fargo\u2019s fourth cousin-in-law Samuel Peabody of Salem married Boston Brahmin Marianne Cabot Lee in 1848, John Butterfield, a third cousin once removed of <italic>Adams Express</italic> founder Alvin Adams, formed <italic>Butterfield Express</italic>. While first sharing <italic>New York Central</italic> RR with <italic>Wells</italic>, <italic>Butterfield </italic>squeezed <italic>Wells</italic> out in 1849. \nSo, <italic>Wells</italic>, <italic>Butterfield</italic>, and <italic>Livingston Fargo</italic> merged in 1850 to form <italic>American Express</italic>, where Henry Wells served as President. A year after government postal service reduced rates in 1851, Wells and William Fargo founded <italic>Wells Fargo Express</italic> for service to California, which grew rapidly due to the <italic>Gold Rush</italic> and absorbed smaller express lines, under the control of Adams and other Boston Brahmin, the descendants of Puritanical church elders Pierpont and Clark, and the Rensselaer and Livingston Knickerbockers.\nUnrelated to the <italic>Glyn</italic> family, Darius Ogden Mills also was a California banking entrepreneur banker. Born to a large landowner and supervisor of a town in Westchester County whose extended Ogden cousins were fur traders who discovered the Great Salt Lake in Utah and served as Chief Justice of Quebec, Mills started as a clerk in New York from 1841 until 1847, when he joined his cousin as a partner and Cashier of <italic>Merchants</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Bank of Erie County</italic> in Buffalo. He moved in California in 1849 to become a banker and bullion dealer, establishing a private bank in Sacramento soon after. \nMeanwhile, in 1850, Anthony Drexel\u2019s daughter married a Rensselaer of Albany and branched to New York under Robert Winthrop. A descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and Massachusetts Bay Colony Governor John Winthrop, Winthrop\u2019s cousin married a Perry sister-in-law of August Belmont in 1841. Within months, Drexel\u2019s brother Francis joined other <italic>Drexel</italic> partners to found <italic>Drexel Sather Church</italic> in San Francisco. <italic>Drexel</italic> and <italic>Clark</italic> soon received gold consignments, which<italic> </italic>they coined at <italic>Mint</italic>, and sold for the consignors and on the own accounts.\nWhile Anthony Drexel had converted to Episcopalism, Francis remained Catholic. Other Catholic bankers organized by this time. Andrew Morris, assistant alderman of New York\u2019s First Ward at the turn of the 19th century and treasurer of <italic>S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Patrick\u2019s Cathedral</italic>, was the first Catholic elected to office in the city, and became a director of <italic>Mechanics Bank</italic> and trustee of <italic>Bank for Savings</italic>, which competed with <italic>Emigrant Savings Bank</italic> to bank Catholics. Since Catholic merchants organized <italic>Irish Emigrant Society</italic>, they managed remittances to <italic>Bank of Ireland</italic>. At the initiative of Reverand John Hughes, as he became New York\u2019s first Archbishop in 1850, leaders of <italic>Irish Emigrant Society</italic> and a single Presbyterian founded <italic>Emigrant</italic><italic> </italic>in 1850 to serve Irish immigrants in New York. \nEugene Kelly was one of <italic>Emigrant</italic>\u2019s Irish directors. He emigrated to New York in 1830 and joined <italic>Donnelly</italic>. Marrying Donnelly\u2019s daughter, he joined Joseph Donohoe to establish a San Francisco store in 1850 and transact gold. After his wife died, he wed Archbishop Hughes\u2019 niece. He later opened <italic>Kelly</italic> in New York and co-founded <italic>Donohoe</italic> <italic>Ralston</italic> bank in San Francisco with Donohoe and William Ralston. After Ralston resigned and allied with Darius Ogden Mills, the San Francisco firm continued as <italic>Donohoe</italic> <italic>Kelly</italic>.\nLikewise, Erastus Corning\u2019s former<italic> Albany City Bank</italic> Cashier Watts Sherman partnered with Scottish Alex Duncan of Providence (not closely related to Stephan Duncan of Mississippi) to form the merchant banking house <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic> in New York in 1851. Like <italic>Belmont</italic>, <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic> relied on <italic>Saint-John Powers</italic><italic> </italic>in Mobile, Alabama. <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic> became <italic>Peabody</italic>\u2019s New York agent to transact on NYSE. By 1853, Saint-Louis-based <italic>Page Bacon</italic>\u2019s sent a son to open a San Francisco branch and corresponded with<italic> Duncan Sherman</italic>. \nThe <italic>Gold Rush</italic> also attracted vendors to service miners. Since Scot <italic>Balfour Williamson</italic> of Liverpool began merchant shipping in Chile, the associated <italic>Balfour Guthrie</italic> dominated the California grain export trade by the late 1860s. Levi Strauss brought denim from the French town of Nimes for miner tents before repurposing it into durable pants. As Strauss relied on his brothers in New York for credit, their <italic>Levi</italic> flourished. \nUnlike the pure gold bankers, two Lazard brothers moved to San Francisco to sell French silks and vault safe deposit to miners and their servicers. Although there were some in California, the Lehmans of Bavaria joined Lazard\u2019s Bavarian Meyer cousins to factor Alabama cotton. Small partnerships of Lazard and Lehman families also vended in New Orleans. By 1860, Abraham Lehman partnered with Meyer Seligman in New York. \nThe Seligmans formed marriage partnerships. As Babette married the son of Frankfurt banker Stettheimer in New York in 1846, brother Joseph married Babet Steinhardt in Bavaria in 1848, and brother Jesse married fellow Bavarian Henrietta Hellman in San Francisco in 1854. While Henrietta\u2019s cousin later control several of California\u2019s banks, Stetthermers ran a clothing business in Natchez, Mississippi, Joseph Seligman and his brother-in-law Max Stetthermer soon operated a dry goods store in New York. \nAs sister-in-law Kathie Steinhardt married a Spiegelberg in New York in 1856. Sister Sara Seligman married Samuel Cohen by 1857. Born in Bavaria, brothers Samuel and Bernhard Cohen immigrated to America in the 1840s and started a dry goods business in Syracuse. After a partnership with Alabama in the 1850s, the brothers moved to New York and continued importing dry goods, and their descendants included New York\u2019s Robert Moses. \nPossibly a nobler clansman, Bernard Seligmann settled in Pennsylvania after working at <italic>Rothchild</italic> Frankfurt. In America, Bernard engaged in cotton manufacturing and married Frances Nusbaum, daughter of John Nusbaum, founder of one of America\u2019s first department stores in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Arriving in the New Mexico Territories in 1856, the Seligmanns trade flourished along the Santa F\u00e9 Trail. Over the years, he served in the legislature and established a private bank. \nKinterlinked with a sister-in-law of a descendant of Samson Wertheim and Michael Speyer, the Gimbels and other Bavarian Jewish immigrants, including the Bache, Bloomingdale (Blumenthal), Kuhn, Goldman, and Sachs families, peddled across America\u2014along with Presbyterians, like Marshall Field, who left Massachusetts for Chicago in 1856\u2014as steel and coal-gas PUs industrialization created jobs and demand inter-connected by railroads. \nThe <italic>Gold Rush</italic> also brought slave-like Chinese debt peon chain gangs in competition with free<italic> </italic>labor. As courts refused to return runaways, California taxed foreign miners in 1852. So, gang importers shifted from term contracts to money credit tickets. Unlike indentures or slaves, employers did not buy unenforceable tickets. Similarly, state canal protectionism prohibited railroads freight. So, roads scattered to wealthy areas and hilly mines. After roads to haul freight for tolls, New York repealed tolls by 1860.<italic></italic>\n<italic>Early American Panics & Big Business I</italic>\nTo balance profit and inflation, America supported monopolies, tariffs, and the gold standard. Limiting competition and employment, these policies fostered political and financial instability.\nBefore Napoleon\u2019s <italic>Code</italic> and Kaulla\u2019s <italic>W\u00fcrttemberg Court Bank</italic> modernized Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, America\u2019s <italic>Revolution</italic> disturbed trade in the 1770s. So, <italic>Astor</italic>, Protestant artisans and butchers in Baden, opened branches in London and America. As furriers fled Albany for Montreal Amidst British blockade, <italic>Astor</italic> swapped Baden-made musical instruments for Canadian furs. From 1795, Congress monopolized the Native American fur trade to stabilize prices and relations. Without enough capital, Congress ended the public system in 1822 and established <italic>Indian Territories</italic> in 1824. After dominating the fur trade, Astor parlayed his wealth into land purchases.\nWhile America\u2019s first gold rush occurred in 1799 in North Carolina, a more notable discovery followed in Georgia in 1829. Over the following decades, the mines attracted immigrant laborers from across the states, mine owners often used enslaved laborers. As miners pushed into lands of Cherokee Native Americans, the latter were forcibly removed from the region. While a significant amount of gold was sent to the <italic>Mint</italic> in Philadelphia via SBUS branches in Charleston and Savanah, the process took months. So, other banks, such as <italic>North Carolina </italic>SB, <italic>Bank of Charleston</italic>, and <italic>Bank of Darien</italic>, established branches or sent agents to mining camps in various states to buy gold. \nWhen buying Louisiana in 1803, Jefferson considered relocating Native Americans over the Mississippi River. As immigration to the South increased, Congress to force Native American tribes to move to Missouri in 1830. Fearing chartered monopolies like EIC and BOE more than free enterprise, President Jackson killed SBUS. After the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>, low cotton prices and a favorable 1842 sugar tariff led to the expansion of sugar cane cultivation across Louisiana. Many French-speaking plantations, formerly dedicated to cotton, converted to sugar. In 1836, the Godchot brothers of Lorraine embarked on a journey to America. Sadly, one of the brothers was lost at sea, but twelve-year-old Leon Godchot arrived in New Orleans. \nChoosing to be an independent pack peddler for a wholesale merchant, Leon, by 1844, established a dry goods store. Over time, he expanded the business, enabling him to bring the rest of his family to America. One brother played a pivotal role in growing the store into a thriving enterprise involved in wholesale trade and clothing manufacturing, while another ventured to the California gold fields in 1849 and later developed significant interests in large-scale stock farming. Godchot\u2019s dry goods store soon became the largest trading establishment in New Orleans.\nAs communications sparked the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic> a year before Samuel Morse invented the telegraph. With Congressional funding, Quaker Ezra Cornell\u2014a second cousin twice removed of Rhode Island\u2019s former lieutenant governor and chief justice Gideon Cornell and a fourth cousin twice removed of Nicholas Biddle\u2014ran a successful trial. Morse tried to sell to the federal government\u2019s <italic>United States Post Office</italic> (\u201cUSPO\u201d), but USPO rejected federalizing the technology. So, Morse leased the patent to dozens of short-line chartered telegraphs across states. Cornell bought one. Following a New York law, Cornell incorporated his telegraph as <italic>Western Union</italic> to buy out-of-state operators with financing from <italic>Riggs Corcoran</italic> of DC. \nSome of the eleven Junker Siemens brothers left Germany for Britain by 1844. After establishing operations telegraph operations in Berlin, William Siemens established <italic>Siemens</italic> in Britain to sell cables. Since the Anglo-Dutch Sephardi Ricardo family had been engaged in stock trading throughout the 18th century, kinterlinking with Goldsmid cousin Keyser family, as well as Christian bankers, half-Jew John Ricardo managed the family financial business. He became MP for Stoke-upon-Trent in 1841 and married a Christian the same year. In 1846, he founded <italic>Electric Telegraph Co</italic> and served as Chair for ten years. He also chaired several railways and was a director of <italic>Westminster Bank</italic>. Along with contributing to the repeal of corn and navigation laws, he proposed placing the telegraph system under the Post Office in 1861.\n\nAfter 1856, however, Scottish-born John Pender built a British consortium,<italic> Imperial</italic>, to dominate the global submarine telegraph cable industry, particularly in the North Atlantic with financiers including <italic>Cazanove</italic>. They enjoyed near-monopoly status, thanks government support to connect India, Australia, and South America across the British Empire with interlocked directorates.\nFrom the early 1850s, American telegraphs cooperated at terminal stations and for standardization. In 1857, <italic>SEWING</italic> inspired them to cartelize into <italic>TELEGRAPH</italic> and agree to share patents, maintenance, and split markets. Through the 1850s, sewing machine manufacturers competed over prices and other dimensions. Legal disputes drove the dominant firms (\u201c<italic>SEWING</italic>\u201d) to pool and cross-license patents in 1856. <italic>SEWING</italic> continued competing with one another and independents in the aftermath of the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>. <italic>SEWING</italic> dissolved when the last patent expired in 1877. Central mass production and traveling peddlers turned <italic>Singer</italic> into America\u2019s first big brand. Protectionist European tariffs and state legislatures often taxed such competitive out-of-state disruptors. By 1860, California subsidized <italic>Western Union</italic>\u2019s affiliate for a telegraph network.\nSince the 1830s\u2014when <italic>Speyer</italic> branched to New York and August Belmont became <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s American agent\u2014Belmont married the daughter of Jane Slidell and Commodore Matthew Perry of Rhode Island and in 1851 and his cousin married Louis Bischoffsheim\u2019s nephew, Ludwig Bamberger. But competition grew, including from German Jews. While Mainz-born Lazarus Hallgarten emigrated to America in 1850, his cousin wed a brother-in-law of Aisik Orchel\u2019s descendant. A sister of Hallgarten\u2019s wife married Heinrich Mainzer, whose great uncle married Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s second great niece and a second cousin wed a Reinach. \nSoon after arriving in New York, Lazarus partnered with Joseph Herzfeld\u2014a son of a Neuss textile manufacturer, Joseph participated in the <italic>Revolution of 1848</italic> and then fled to America\u2014to found <italic>Hallgarten</italic> to exchange emigrant money for gold. By establishing connections with banking centers in Frankfort and elsewhere, <italic>Hallgarten</italic> began selling checks on foreign countries. \nJacob Nachod\u2014a Katz descendant of Simon Bondi, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother, Joseph Goldschmidt, and Lipman Cohen-Behrens\u2014co-founded the mixed religion <italic>Knauth Nachod </italic>in New York and Leipzig with a dynastic merchant. And after Gustav Bawer of Bonn became <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> New York agent in 1854, Gustav Bawer hired Hermann Marcuse, possibly a descendant of Berlin Mint Jews. After Bawer retired in 1859, Marcuse succeeded him as <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>\u2019s agent, renaming <italic>Bawer</italic> as <italic>Marcuse Baltzer</italic>. By 1860, Marcuse co-founded <italic>Germania</italic> LIC with other German Americans, including <italic>Berenberg Gossler </italic>cousin <italic>Amsinck</italic>.\nTo a greater extent that Jews, Huguenots linked finance and politics across states. Since his ancestors arrived in Maryland in 1660, Gazaway Lamar had interest in <italic>Mechanics Bank of Augusta</italic> by 1833\u2014where his brother was a cashier\u2014and introduced America\u2019s first iron steamship in 1834, before investing in bridges and his family\u2019s cotton plantations. \nBecoming President of <italic>Bank of the Republic</italic> in New York, Lamar advised Howell Cobb, his cousin by marriage and Governor of Georgia, as well as his cousin, Mirabeau Lamar, during the latter\u2019s presidency of the Republic of Texas. Lamar\u2019s second marriage connected him to the Cazenove family. By 1855, Gazaway stepped down as the president of <italic>Bank of the Republic</italic> to focus on his commission merchant business in New York, concurrently assuming the presidency of Savannah\u2019s <italic>Bank of Commerce</italic>.\nHuguenots and Boston Brahmins also interlaced states with railroads to transport coal. Along with investing in <italic>Chicago</italic>, <italic>Burlington & Quincy </italic>RR in the 1840s, William Forbes of the Boston Brahmin China traders<italic> Russell </italic>advanced funds to America\u2019s first heavy iron rail-producing rolling mills in Cumberland, Maryland. After Huguenot descendant Bostonian Warren Delano wed a daughter of Boston Brahmin Judge Lyman, Warren joined <italic>Russell</italic>. When the mills faced trouble in 1847, Forbes convinced Erastus Corning and Warren Delano to take over the concern. Likewise, <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s Russ Sturgis joined <italic>Baring</italic> London as a Partner by 1851. \nAs <italic>Baltimore & Ohio</italic> RR entered western Virginia from 1852, <italic>PENN</italic> entered Pittsburgh, and Delano\u2019s <italic>Consolidated Coal </italic>(\u201c<italic>COALB</italic>\u201d) mined. Another <italic>COALB </italic>investor was Gardiner Howland, whose sister was the third wife of former BONY President Isaac Roosevelt\u2019s son James (after Eliza Roosevelt Barclay and former New York Governor James DeLancey\u2019s niece-in-law Maria Walton died.) Since Isaac\u2019s second cousin once removed, Cornelius Shaack Roosevelt, co-founded <italic>Chemical Bank</italic>, and married a Lloyd and Wharton cousin, their son, James-Alfred, also married a Quaker cousin of the Lukens industrialists of Pennsylvania, in 1847. Also in 1852, Mary Keene, an extended cousin of the political families of Virginia and Kentucky, wed a <italic>Riggs </italic>heir of DC.\nWhile free<italic> </italic>incorporation industrialized Pennsylvania, Virginia chartered 46 collieries between 1846 and 1861. Despite demand from New York\u2019s <italic>Manhattan Gas</italic>, river transport was unreliable. Virginia limited bank and road charters to favor the cotton trade. But as Congress lowered tariffs amidst falling British steel prices in 1846, free<italic> </italic>laborers struck. As the North built railroads with free<italic> </italic>labor, Black magnates helped industrialize from Ohio to British Columbia. Meanwhile, Southern state-run railroads rented enslaved Blacks from planters. By 1855, Tennessee legalized the inter-state slave trade outlawed in 1826.\nWithout central clearing, banks cleared broker transactions with certified checks using escrowed funds. Collateral delivery secured the loan. Against clearing risk, SBs <italic>over</italic>certified credit and settled trades in time contracts. SBs intermediated credit by lending on the NYSE <italic>collateral money market</italic> (\u201cMMSEC\u201d). For such loans, creditors appraise borrowers on collateral without default risk. \nAs SBs kept excess cash in MMSEC, brokers carried security inventory on margin. MMSEC permitted inter-state trade. Rural farm banks invested in MMSEC at harvest and withdrew at planting. So, as farming inflated NYSE, market cycles disrupted credit. In 1853, New York banks organized the<italic> Clearinghouse Association</italic> (\u201cNYCH\u201d). Without gold and <italic>over</italic>certification, banks settled using NYCH balances. Despite NYCH, interest rates remained seasonal, and so did panics. \nWhile the <italic>Gold Rush</italic> lasted until 1855, gold production growth in California topped in 1852 as diminishing returns kicked in. Rapid technological advances tightened profit margins and required greater capital resources, spurring the \u2018picks and shovels\u2019 businesses that suppled the heavily leveraged miners with inside trade credit. Despite less gold, Midwestern grain prices grew to feed Italy as Russia blocked the Black Sea trade during the <italic>Crimean War</italic> from 1853. \nHowever, as the war ended, European demand for wheat from America\u2019s West fell and\u2014instead of lowering prices to repay the Eastern merchants who could then retire their debts to the banks\u2014held on to CP. Concurrently, high coal prices squeezed shippers. As <italic>Cunard </italic><italic>Shipping</italic>\u2019s <italic>Burns</italic> and <italic>Maclver</italic> investors reduced pressure by merging services, P&O <italic>Steam</italic> restructured her management by 1854. But as <italic>Jardine Matheson</italic> (\u201c<italic>Jardine</italic>\u201d)\u2014having split from <italic>Magniac Smyth</italic>\u2014opened a Far East to Calcutta cargo line in 1855, <italic>Collins</italic> lost her <italic>Pacific</italic> and <italic>Arctic</italic> ships, and <italic>Cunard</italic> broke their shipping conference of 1850 by 1856.\nAmidst the <italic>Crimean War</italic>, <italic>Page Bacon</italic>\u2019s Indiana and Missouri investments defaulted in 1854. When the New York-based <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic> refused to accept drafts upon them by <italic>Page Bacon </italic>in early 1855, the latter suspended operations the following day and\u2014although the doors reopened after a month when a shipment of $3 million gold from the San Francisco branch was delivered on behalf of the Saint-Louis branch, news of the earlier suspension reached creditors in San Francisco, who now had $3 million less of gold. As creditors from Missouri and California attached claims across states, <italic>Page Bacon</italic>\u2019s suspension precipitated a banking collapse in San Francisco. Among the several banks to open in Sacramento that year was a branch of <italic>Drexel Sather Church</italic>, <italic>Drexel</italic>\u2019s California partnership out of San Francisco.\nThe liquidated casualties of the <italic>Panic of 1855</italic> included all 83 French-funded California-based mines companies founded since 1849. As only 18 miners had limited liability\u2014eight in France, three each in Britain, Australia, and California, and one in New York\u2014and as European capital withdrew from California. Liquidations sold machinery for scraps and spread to inside creditors\u2014between 50 and 66% of all merchants filed\u2014as property values retreated. But <italic>Lazard</italic> San Francisco grew to five employees as another Lazard brother and cousin Alexandre Weill arrived in 1855. As two Lazard brothers left to start <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris in 1858, Alexandre\u2019s brother Raphael secured a partnership in with San Francisco\u2019s<italic> JW Davidson Dry Goods Store</italic> that year, soon establishing a Paris buying agency with credit from the family.\nMeanwhile, the agricultural Midwest\u2019s financial situation worsened. Like in the <italic>Panic of 1855</italic>, inter-state banking relationships played a role. At the time, promoters raised more capital when they ran out unable to reorg debt as lack of bankruptcy law forced Europeans to finance railroads using unsecured bonds. \nAfter <italic>Prime</italic> hired Astor\u2019s affiliate James King per his suggestion in 1826, King convinced BOE to end suspension and received a $5 million loan to alleviate the <italic>Panic of 1837</italic>. While King\u2019s daughter married William Duer\u2019s grandson (nephew of former SBUS <italic>New Orleans</italic> President Beverley Chew, King\u2019s brother-in-law Archibald Gracie became President of <italic>Baring</italic> Mobile in Alabama. As <italic>Brown</italic> opened branches in Mobile and New Orleans, <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic> and <italic>Belmont</italic> relied on <italic>Saint-</italic><italic>John Powers</italic>. \nHowever, the <italic>Panic of 1847</italic> brought down <italic>Prime</italic>, with blame falling on commodity speculation. As marriages unwound, the partnership restructured. Amidst the crisis, George Sherman\u2014an extended cousin of Watts Sherman\u2014served as counsel and director of <italic>Jefferson County Bank</italic>, which he represented during the failure of <italic>Prime</italic>. Withdrawing from law and when he retired from law and <italic>Watertown Bank & Loan</italic>, he devoted himself to <italic>Jefferson</italic>.\nDespite radical politicians trying to abolish banking altogether in 1847, <italic>Saint-</italic><italic>John Powers</italic> prospered as Alabama lacked banking infrastructure. By the 1850s, neighboring state banks, such as <italic>Bank of </italic><italic>Saint-</italic><italic>Mary</italic>\u2019s from Georgia, circulated notes in Alabama, with some forming agencies lacking legal recognition. <italic>Saint-</italic><italic>John Powers</italic> benefited from Partner William Chandler. His father, Daniel Chandler, a prominent lawyer, established a legal practice in Mobile with his brother-in-law, John Campbell, who a became Court Justice in 1853. By 1857, William married a daughter of Darius Holbrook, who co-founded <italic>Illinois Central</italic> RR.\nUnder the leadership of Hugh McCulloch and James Lanier, the success of <italic>Indiana</italic><italic> </italic>SB\u2019s insured banking system through the <italic>Panic of 1839</italic> led Ohio\u2019s banks to use Indiana banknotes and inspired Ohio to adopt insured <italic>Ohio</italic> SB branches in 1845. The rush to reach California drove Lanier resigned from <italic>Indiana</italic> SB and partnered with Richard Winslow, a direct descendant of Plymouth Colony Governor Winslow, and formed <italic>Lanier Winslow </italic>in 1849<italic>. Lanier Winslow</italic> soon sold the first Western railway bonds in New York instead of Boston. Specializing in Ohio and Indiana railways, <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic> later imported European capital by forming relationships with <italic>Hope </italic>of Amsterdam, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris, and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London.\nBy 1848, rail linked Cincinnati to major cities in the East, building on the city\u2019s access to the Ohio River, which provided transportation routes for shipping their products. At the time, Cincinnati was a bustling city nicknamed \u2018Porkopolis\u2019 due to its thriving hog-butchering trade, which provided a ready supply of animal fats, essential for soap and candle production. After William Procter and James Gamble fled fires and famines in Britain, their mutual father-in-law, who recognized the potential synergy between Gamble\u2019s soap-making trade and Procter\u2019s candle-making trade, both of which required lye. In 1837, the brothers-in-law established <italic>Procter Gamble</italic> in Cincinnati.\nCincinnati also developed the largest concentration of Jews west of Atlantic. Born to a Protected Jew in Bavarian Demmelsdorf, Henry Mack witnessed increased discrimination against Jews following Napoleon\u2019s defeat. When his brother inherited the Protected Jew status, Henry and his younger siblings moved to America. Unable to find work in New York, they moved Cincinnati. Similarly, born to Protected Jews along the cattle trade route in Pfarrweisach, Bavaria, Philip Heidelbach and two brothers emigrated to America around 1835. After peddling, he partnered with Jacob Seasongood to form dry goods merchant <italic>Heidelbach Seasongood </italic>in Cincinnati in 1837. They expanded into a textile factory and a wholesale store in 1842. By 1850, Philip\u2019s brother married a descendant of Joseph Goldschmidt, Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s sister, and a Warburg. \nLikely a descendant of the Alsatian Katz Wahls, Jacob Netter moved to America in 1833. He peddled with Rhinelander Abraham Kuhn, who arrived by 1839. As Kuhn sold dry goods and manufactured pants in Lafayette, Indiana, his sister married Netter in 1845. By 1849, Kuhn married his distant cousin Clara Loeb of d\u2019Worms and employed her brother, Solomon. In 1850, Kuhn relocated to Cincinnati\u2014where Mack and other Jews developed a textile industry\u2014he formed a clothing business with Oppenheim and Rothschild cousin Adolph Rindskopf of Frankfurt. \nSoon after, <italic>Kuhn </italic><italic>Rindskopf</italic> reformed as <italic>Kuhn </italic><italic>Netter</italic>, which Solomon Loeb joined as he married Kuhn\u2019s sister Fanny in 1852. As Fanny died after childbirth, Loeb married Betty Gallenberg of Mannheim. Loeb had emigrated to America with the aid of the Mayor of Worms Ferdinand Gernsheim Eberstadt. While the Mayor\u2019s great-grandfather had wed an Oppenheim of unknown lineage, his cousin was the last Jewish Bishop of Worms and founder of leather business <italic>Gernsheim</italic> in 1768. Of unknown relation to this family, Loeb\u2019s cousin Sol married Regine Gernsheim of Worms, a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim. Meanwhile, Sol\u2019s aunt married Daniel Wolff, whose son Samuel worked for <italic>Kuhn Netter</italic>.\nJews also soon made political and economic progress in Chicago. From the family of a representative of Napoleon\u2019s Grand Sanhedrin related to the Rothschilds, Bavarian Henry Greenbaum and his brothers emigrated to Chicago by 1848. In 1855, they founded <italic>Greenbaum</italic>, a mortgage lender that became a cornerstone of Chicago\u2019s financial community, and he was soon elected as Chicago\u2019s first Jewish alderman. By 1857, Greenbaum\u2019s niece married Gerhard Foreman, whose Bavarian father arrived in America around 1838 and opened <italic>Foreman</italic>, Chicago\u2019s first wholesale clothing house, in 1854. Foreman worked at <italic>Greenebaum </italic>as cashier, and by 1863 the firm operated as <italic>Greenebaum Foreman</italic>. \nLikewise, Bavarian-born Lazarus Silverman emigrated in 1849, settled in Sumter County, Alabama. Peddling from 1853, he moved to Chicago and began banking in 1854, dividing capital between finance and real estate. In 1857, his bank held through the panic during his trip to Europe. He married the daughter of a Louisville merchant in 1859.\nMeanwhile, the importance of inter-state law is also evident in the choices of executives for <italic>Ohio Life Insurance & Trust </italic>(\u201cOLIT\u201d). Back in 1834, New Yorkers\u2014including John Astor, <italic>Prime</italic>\u2019s Nathaniel Prime, and John Mason, director of <italic>Bank of New York</italic> and President of <italic>Chemical Bank</italic>\u2014formed OLIT to invest in the Midwest to intermediate investment without bankruptcy law. Descended from leading Huguenots and Knickerbockers of New Amsterdam, Thomas Vermilye graduated <italic>Yale</italic> and became a pastor of a New York Presbyterian church in 1826, then of the Congregational church at West Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1829. \nWhile his brother William married a Roosevelt cousin in 1827 and became the inaugural Cashier of <italic>Merchants</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Exchange Bank</italic> in 1830, another brother Washington founded a NYSE brokerage in 1832, <italic>Vermilye</italic>, and married Elizabeth Dwight Lathrop related to prominent clergy and an extended cousin of Juliet Pierpont Morgan. \nBy 1840, William became Cashier of <italic>Manhattan Co Bank</italic>, and Treasurer of OLIT in 1846, until leaving to join <italic>Vermilye </italic>in 1849, and selling securities to Europe. Their younger brother, Jacob worked at <italic>Merchants</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Exchange Bank,</italic> <italic>Leather Bank</italic>, and a paying teller of an SBUS <italic>New York</italic> before transitioning to Cashier of <italic>New Jersey </italic>SB into the 1850s. By 1853, Vermilye\u2019s daughter married John Burrill, a descendant of colonial Massachusetts magistrates, who co-founded the<italic> New York Bar Association </italic>by 1870.\nBy 1851, there were three types of banks in Ohio\u2014Old Banks (e.g., OLIT), <italic>Ohio</italic> SB branches, and unincorporated\u2014with a diversity of taxation charters. <italic>Farmer\u2019s Bank of Marion</italic> was one of the latter. Her organizer, Abraham Monnett, was the son of a reverend descended from Charlamagne and Huguenots and had married a cousin-in-law of the Sands and Cameron families. Serving as President of <italic>Farmer\u2019s Bank </italic>from 1851, Monnett became one of Marion County\u2019s largest landowners and dealers of cattle, hogs, and sheep.\nThat year, Indiana adopted free banking. As Indiana free banks multiplied to fill the need for money in Ohio, in May 1854, Ohio outlawed small banknotes from other states, precipitating a run on Indiana banks\u2014destroying half of the state\u2019s free banks, while the insured <italic>Indiana</italic> SB system survived. The run reverberated back on <italic>Ohio</italic> SB and New York\u2019s stock market. The depreciation of Indiana\u2019s notes spread the panic to Illinois.\nInstead of wealthy stockholders, OLIT developed banking partnerships. Since <italic>Prime</italic> banker George Coe of Rhode Island became Cashier of OLIT, he resigned to become VP of <italic>American Exchange Bank</italic> in 1852, and the politically connected Rockwell became Cashier and now argued for closing the Ohio operation and focusing efforts on building up the New York office. \nBy 1855, OLIT\u2019s Cashier Rockwell<italic> </italic>left to lead the <italic>Cleveland & Pittsburgh </italic>RR<italic> </italic>(\u201cCPR\u201d). While Coe and other eastern trustees wrote to OLIT President Stetson in Ohio concerning a maturity mismatch that could lead to a run, they supported Rockwell\u2019s successor, Cashier Ludlow, in 1857 lending over 25% of OLIT\u2019s capital to CPR through unsecured bonds, financed using bonds pledged to its deposit bank in New York\u2014<italic>American Exchange Bank</italic>\u2014and subject to bank calls. Still, banks did not call these. But as British steel prices recovered from lows, American railroads switched to free<italic> </italic>trade.\nOLIT, however, faced competition. Jonathan Sturges\u2014born to a representative from Connecticut representative of the earliest Congresses and state Court judge and fourth cousin once removed of Russ Sturgis\u2014co-founded New York\u2019s <italic>Bank of Commerce</italic> in 1839 with <italic>Prime</italic> and promoted <italic>New York & New Haven</italic> RR and <italic>Illinois Central</italic> RR by 1851, buying land along the railway route. Phillip Schulyer\u2019s grandson, Robert Schuyler, a nephew of Alex Hamilton and Comfort Sands, headed both roads, along with <italic>New York & Harlem</italic> RR and <italic>Vermont Valley</italic>, and served as treasurer in four other lines. \nBy 1854, Schuyler issued false shares of <italic>New York & Harlem</italic> RR stock and defrauding <italic>New York & New Haven</italic> RR into bankruptcy, leading creditors to run from <italic>Illinois Central</italic> RR<italic>. </italic>So, as Sturges\u2019 daughter married WH Osborn of the Pacific trade in 1853, he and John Griswold\u2014associated with <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s China trade\u2014joined <italic>Illinois Central</italic> RR\u2019s board in 1854. While Griswold assumed the presidency of <italic>Illinois Central</italic> RR for a year in 1855 before Osborn succeeded him for a decade. Griswold\u2019s daughter later married John Forbes\u2019 son.\nWhen  reduced tariffs to free<italic> </italic>trade, <italic>Bank of Commerce</italic>\u2019s Stevens family kinterlinked with the Heckscher family of Hamburg, relatives of <italic>Stiglitz</italic> and other European trading families. Around the same time, stock market bears shorted CPR and OLIT. As<italic> Erie </italic>RR reduced rates, a railroad cartel elected Rockwell as head to fixed rates. As railroad prices fell, the arbitrage fell apart. \nAfter absorbing OLIT and depositors, <italic>Ohio</italic> SB lent to OLIT\u2019s New York correspondents. <italic>Ohio</italic> SB also instructed OLIT <italic>New York</italic> to prioritize <italic>Ohio</italic> SB. Without NYCH aid, Ohio courts seized OLIT\u2019s New York assets. Soon after, New York\u2019s court<italic> </italic>granted New York banks attachments, 44% to <italic>American Exchange Bank</italic>. Among the capsulitis on the Panic were <italic>Drexel Sather Church</italic>, <italic>Drexel</italic>\u2019s California partnership, which suspended for several months and led <italic>Drexel</italic> to withdraw soon after.\nAs new telegraphy fueled the <italic>Panic of </italic>1857, banks innovated railroad debt reorgs in the Midwest. By 1860, Coe became President of <italic>American Exchange Bank</italic> and proposed a new credit instrument\u2014the clearinghouse loan certificate\u2014to NYCH and it was adopted soon after. Investing in Ohio coal roads from the 1840s, Daniel Rhodes grew after OLIT, followed by his Quaker-Huguenot son-in-law, Marcus Converse Hanna. \nSimilarly, Joseph Wharton\u2014whose Quaker grandfather had married Abraham Redwood\u2019s granddaughter, a <italic>Hottinguer</italic> and <italic>Baring </italic>cousin, great-granduncle wed a <italic>Lloyd</italic> cousin, and sister wed the son of Quaker SBUS banker Jacob Barker, kinterlinking with <italic>Blake</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s Boston securities agent\u2014founded <italic>Bethlehem Iron</italic>. <italic>Indiana</italic> SB<italic>, </italic>meanwhile, promoted Hugh McCulloch to lead the institution from 1857.\nWhile the <italic>Crimean War</italic> temporarily inflated American grain prices in the Midwest, the South escaped the panic reinvigorated. Since liberalizing SBs in 1853, Virginia linked the Port of Norfolk to western coal in 1858. But tariff and free<italic> </italic>labor debate grew following the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic> with riots and British textile demand for Southern cotton. While collieries sought tariffs, wood was cheap. After Pennsylvania revoked the SBUS-era bank charter suspension penalty during the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>, calls to spur coal competition and revoke <italic>PENN</italic>\u2019s charter in 1859 did not materialize. \nProminent women also engaged in debates about slavery and family. Although her origins are debated, Mary Pleasant moved to San Francisco as a free Black woman in 1849 and used her inheritance from her husband to build a fortune. She claimed to have supported John Brown\u2019s 1859 raid on Harper\u2019s Ferry, though the evidence for this is uncertain. On the other side of the spectrum, Louisa Cheves McCord, daughter of former SBUS President Langdon Cheves, was a leading opponent of abolitionism and women\u2019s rights. She used her knowledge of Latin and political economy to defend slavery in her essays, and by 1857, had inherited the Lang Syne plantation following the deaths of her husband David McCord and her father.\n<italic>Brown Shipley</italic> and <italic>Lee </italic>dominated Boston Brahmin merchant banking. With ancestors engaged in foreign trade since the 1750s, John Cabot Lee and his third cousin and cousin-in-law, George Higginson\u2014whose wife descended from Reverend John Cotton\u2014founded <italic>Lee</italic> <italic>Higginson</italic> (\u201c<italic>Lee</italic>\u201d) in 1852 to bank. While <italic>Lee</italic> had depended on <italic>Baring</italic> until the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>, she shifted to <italic>Speyer</italic> afterward. \nAlong with being relatives of Thomas Handasyd Perkins, George Higginson\u2019s father founded <italic>Higginson Dodge</italic> with his nephew-in-law David Dodge, Dodge\u2019s son William co-founded <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> to import British metals in the 1830s. William\u2019s second cousin once removed, Henry Lee Higginson, formed <italic>Lee</italic> and his fourth cousin twice removed, John Morgan, thrived. When William Dodge died, <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> reorganized in 1859 to focus on mining and a Phelps married Newton Saint-John\u2019s first cousin once removed in a year.\nBut <italic>Lee</italic> had friendly competition. John Cabot Lee\u2019s third cousins once removed, John and Nathaniel Thayer, sons of a <italic>Harvard</italic> trained Massachusetts Unitarian minister of Lancaster and descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and 17th century Puritan leader John Cotton, established <italic>Thayer</italic> bank and broker in Boston by 1824. In 1847, Nathaniel Thayer married a Rensselaer and hired Henry Kidder from the office of <italic>Coolidge Haskell</italic>. Kidder later became Overseer of <italic>Harvard</italic> and President of <italic>American Unitarian Association</italic>. \nThayer also hired the sons of a Peabody, a Unitarian pastor of Springfield and fourth cousin of George Peabody. While Francis Peabody worked at <italic>Chicopee Bank</italic> before joining <italic>Thayer</italic> in 1847, Oliver joined after <italic>Phillips Exeter Academy</italic> in 1849. John Thayer operated until his death in 1857, after which <italic>Thayer</italic> survived the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic> under Nathaniel. After Nathaniel died in 1865, the new partners formed <italic>Kidder Peabody</italic> (\u201c<italic>Kidder</italic>\u201d).\nFar from Boston Brahmin, Clark and Cooke in Philadelphia were linked by their Puritan heritage. Since Jay Cooke became partner at <italic>Clark</italic> in 1842, he acquired land warrants in Iowa during the 1850s, and <italic>Clark</italic> merged three railroads in 1854, connecting Iowa, Pittsburgh, and Chicago as Cooke became Senior Partner in Philadelphia, <italic>Clark</italic> founder Enoch Clark died amidst the <italic>Panic of</italic><italic> 1857</italic>, Cooke led and started <italic>Cooke</italic>. \nEdward Dode, an extended cousin of Clark and Cooke, worked at <italic>Clark</italic> before joining <italic>Cooke</italic> as a Partner. Dode married the aunt-in-law of Henry Dabney, heir of a Huguenot family with longtime ties to Virginia, Maryland, and the Portuguese Azores. While the Dabneys had traded Portuguese wine with Henry DeLancey Barclay and his nephew Schuyler Livingston in New York, the latter shifted their focus from trade to agriculture by the 1850s.\nSharing 14th century English aristocrats as ancestors with Cooke, Juliet Pierpont descended from the Puritan reverends Thomas Hooker, Elder John Strong, and James Pierpont, co-founder of <italic>Yale</italic>, and extended cousin-in-law of the Campbells. Juliet was also a cousin once removed of <italic>COALB</italic>\u2019s Catherine Lyman Delano and second cousin once removed of <italic>Mutual </italic>LIC of New York director Richard McCurdy. She soon married <italic>Aetna Insurance </italic>director Junius Morgan. \nBy then Morgan had partnered with Roland Mather, whose step-great grandfather married Morgan\u2019s second great uncle. A descendant of Emperor Charlemagne,  Mather was born in Westfield, Massachusetts into a clerical and medical family, with his uncle marrying a descendant of Reverand Hooker. In 1825, he went to Boston for training, and then moved to Hartford, Connecticut, where, in 1831, he became partner in <italic>Pratt</italic> <italic>Howe</italic>, with James Pratt and Edmund Howe. In 1836, Howe and Mather bought Pratt\u2019s interest, and added Morgan to form <italic>Mather Morgan</italic>. Mather became a director of <italic>Aetna</italic> in 1847, co-founded <italic>Charter Oak Bank</italic> in 1853, and became a director of <italic>Hartford Bank</italic><italic> </italic>soon after.\nDuring one of his frequent trips to Boston in 1850, Morgan arranged to go into business with James Beebe, a leading dry goods merchant and importer of that city. <italic>Beebe</italic> <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s junior partner was Levi Morton. Descended from Emperor Charlamagne and New England Puritans, Morton was a third cousin of Juliet Pierpont Morgan and a third cousin once removed of Moses Allens, born in Vermont to Reverend Daniel Morton and a daughter of Reverend Justin Parsons, a descendant of Elder John Strong. \nAfter rural retailing in the 1840s, Morton managed <italic>Beebe</italic> <italic>Morgan </italic>New York until 1854. That year, Morton established a New York dry goods firm with fellow Puritan and his extended cousin, William Grinnell, who married Morton\u2019s sister soon after. A distant cousin of Thomas-Handasyd Perkins, the Grinnells kinterlinked with the Howlands. An employee of <italic>Morton Grinnell</italic> was New Yorker Walter Burns.\nMeanwhile, as an heirless bachelor, George Peabody added Junius Morgan as a  <italic>Peabody</italic> partner in 1854, although the latter remained affiliated with other businesses as least for several years. At fifteen, Junius\u2019 son John traveled to Faial, in the Azores, in 1852 to recover from rheumatic fever under the care of the Dabneys. \nIn 1857, he joined <italic>Peabody</italic>\u2019s New York-correspondent, <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic>, under the management of Henry Dabney. By 1861, John became <italic>Peabody</italic>\u2019s American representative, and married Amelia, the daughter of Connecticut railroad banker Jonathan Sturges. Ahead of George Peabody\u2019s retirement, John and Dabney left <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic> to form <italic>Morgan</italic> <italic>Dabney</italic>. After Peabody left, <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic> took their account to Argyll cousins <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> instead of staying with successor Junius Morgan.\nExtended cousins of John Morgan\u2019s father, the Jesups started in America with Edward Jesup, who emigrated from Sheffield, England, to Stamford, Connecticut, around 1650. He was among the early settlers who was involved in land purchases from Native Americans. His great-grandson, Ebenezer was a merchant in Saugatuck, Connecticut, and President of <italic>Bridgeport Bank</italic> from the 1830s. After Ebenezer\u2019s son William moved to New York and engaged on Wall Street, William\u2019s son James graduated <italic>Yale</italic> and became a lawyer in 1840. \nJames married a granddaughter of Reverend Samuel Sherwood, a cousin of former VP and <italic>Manhattan Co Bank</italic>-founder Aaron Burr. Another of Ebenezer\u2019s grandsons, Morris, who married the daughter of Dutch Reverend Thomas DeWitt in 1854, an extended cousin of the Patroon Rensselaer family and John Morgan\u2019s mother through the Lord family. Morris founded <italic>Jesup</italic>, which initially financed steam railroads and later expanded to street and electric railroads.\nLikewise, marriages linked other bank and railroad estates. While their Stevens and Mason in-laws led <italic>Bank of Commerce</italic> and <italic>Chemical Bank </italic>in New York and <italic>New York & Harlem</italic> RR, Rochester attorneys Abraham and Jacob Schermerhorn\u2014whose father was Joanna Livingston Cortlandt\u2019s second cousin once removed and mother a second cousin once removed of John Rockefeller\u2019s mother\u2014offered financial support and managerial direction to early Central lines. Jacob supported <italic>Syracuse & Binghamton</italic> RR and served as its president for over a decade. \nAbraham was President of <italic>Bank of Monroe</italic>, Rochester mayor, and a House representative for two terms. In 1833, he became a commissioner for the sale of<italic> </italic><italic>Tonawanda</italic> RR stock, later becoming its treasurer and board member. Abraham married Helen Cortlandt White, a granddaughter of Catherine Roosevelt Barclay. By 1853, Abraham\u2019s daughters wed a cousin of the Pennsylvania landowning Avery Rockefeller clan and an Astor. \nSince John Astor worked with his father, a descendant of London merchants, Moses Taylor lost his fortune in the 1835 fire, and recovered to become President of <italic>Citi</italic><italic> Bank</italic> in 1855 as Astor gained control. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>, <italic>Citi</italic> invested in <italic>Delaware, Lackawanna & Western</italic> RR. In 1859, Taylor\u2019s daughter married <italic>Drexel</italic> partner Robert Winthrop, whose cousin had married a Perry sister-in-law of August Belmont.\nJohn Davison Rockefeller\u2019s third great-grandfather, Solomon Avery\u2014 a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and a nephew of Nathaniel Prime\u2019s great aunt\u2014was a grantee of Chiswick, New Hampshire, and a proprietor of <italic>Susquehanna Land Co</italic>, which settled the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania after the <italic>Revolution</italic>. While Solomon married the daughter of the Reverend of New Haven, her sister wed the brother-in-law of Reverend Thomas Hooker\u2019s second great-granddaughter. Solomon\u2019s son inherited over 1,000 acres along Tunkhannock Creek and served as justice of the peace and colonel of militia. A daughter of Solomon\u2019s other son married the great-grandson of Johann Rockefeller, who immigrated from Germany around 1723 and acquired large landholdings in New Jersey. \nBy 1859, John Davison Rockefeller\u2019s third cousin once removed married a Howland Russell whaling heir weeks after Colonel EL Drake and miners discovered petroleum in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and the resulting kerosene competed as a substitute for whaling illuminants and coal-based gas. Among the pioneers was Samuel Downer of Boston, a fourth cousin once removed of John Thayer, who shifted  from manufacturing whale oil candles to kerosene. Supplying refiners with sulfuric acid for processing, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e DuPont\u2019s nephew Henry soon formed a lucrative, long-term relationship with Rockefeller.\nMeanwhile, commodity discoveries disrupted work and money. George Hearst arrived in California in 1850, initially trying mining and storekeeping before focusing on quartz mines near Nevada City and Grass Valley. Over five years, he prospected and sold quartz claims while the <italic>Gold Rush</italic> ended. Upon learning of a silver strike in Nevada in 1859, he invested in the Ophir mine. As he extracted rich ore, sparking California\u2019s interest in the Comstock Lode, and inflating gold. \nWhile New York imposed railroad tolls as canal traffic fell, Pennsylvania abolished tolls and sold canals to railroads. Since canal protectionism scattered roads, Vanderbilt consolidated Northern roads. But marriage united the North and South. After his grandfather was killed by Native Americans when he moved from Virginia to Kentucky on the advice of Daniel Boone, Abraham Lincoln became a lawyer in Illinois before marrying Mary Todd, the daughter of Kentucky state senator and President of <italic>Bank of Kentucky</italic>\u2019s Lexington branch and Campbell family cousin-in-law. As coal and Tennessee\u2019s John Bell\u2014who had married Thomas Yeatman\u2019s Erwin widow and Henry Clay\u2019s in-law\u2014split Democrats, Republican Lincoln won in 1860. \nAlthough Astor, Belmont, Lamar, and other New York Democrats sought to prevent war, they failed. By 1861, Southern default upon seceding into the Confederacy set off Northern insolvencies. Moreover, prominent Democrats lost power. Since his Christian family immigrated from Germany started a sugar refinery in New York, local born William Havemeyer graduated from <italic>Columbia</italic> in 1823 and expanded the family business. Havemeyer entered politics in 1844 as a delegate to the Democratic general committee of New York City and served as Mayor in 1845 and 1848. Afterward, he assumed the presidency of <italic>Bank of North America</italic> from 1851 and of <italic>New York Savings Bank</italic> from 1857. He resigned from both posts in 1861.\nOther Democrats quickly changed alliances. Chicago banker Henry Greenbaum actively supported Stephen Douglas in 1860 and was nominated as a Democratic presidential elector for Illinois. With the outbreak of war, he abandoned the Democrats and threw his support behind the Union. During the war, he helped raise and equip troops, including the 82nd Illinois Infantry, and participated in public efforts to boost enlistment.\nThe <italic>Civil War</italic> split families. Like President Lincoln\u2019s wife Mary Todd had Confederate officer half-brothers, New York-born Louisiana Senator John Slidell\u2019s nephew become a Union General. While Southern General Lee had a Union admiral cousin, Union General Grant\u2019s wife had owned slaves in the South. Even Confederate President Jefferson Davis\u2014a widowed son-in-law of former President Taylor\u2014had remarried to a daughter of a former New Jersey governor who had a brother in the <italic>Union</italic> navy. (Jefferson Davis\u2019 older brother Joseph had founded <italic>Mississippi Bar Association</italic>, <italic>Trinity Episcopal Church</italic> of Natchez, and Black-run cooperative colony of Davis Bend in Mississippi.) \nOn April 12, 1861, the conflict commenced with the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter. In response, President Lincoln swiftly called up 75,000 members of state militias, marking a significant mobilization effort. Concurrently, Confederate President Davis authorized privateers, while Lincoln, on April 19, ordered a blockade of all southern ports from Virginia to Texas. These events had profound consequences on American trade with China. The disruption of the <italic>Civil War</italic> impacted Boston\u2019s <italic>Heard</italic> as its concerns shifted from the disappointing business at new treaty ports to the war\u2019s economic repercussions. With dwindling tea shipments, slowed cotton trade, and scarce American ships for charter in the East due to rising insurance costs from the Confederate threat. \nOpposed to Alabama\u2019s secession and committed to the Union cause, <italic>Saint-</italic><italic>John Powers</italic>\u2019 Newton Saint-John relocated his family from Mobile to New York in May 1861. The same year, <italic>Baring</italic> partners and cousins once removed Edward Baring and Henry Bingham Mildmay married the aristocratic daughters of the 2nd Earl Grey and Devon banker John Bulteel, descended from an early Huguenot director of BOE.And a cousin of <italic>Prime</italic>\u2019s King of New York, Archibald Gracie had been a President of <italic>Baring</italic> Mobile, but joined the Confederate Army, and was later killed in action. \nSince Louisiana\u2019s annual sugar crop increased from 77 to 298 thousand units between 1832 and 1861, inability to save the crop in 1862 had devastating consequences, leading to financial ruin for many planters, factors, and banks. The <italic>Civil War</italic> disrupted the industry, resulting in diversification of crops and a sharp decline in sugar production. The losses, including land and slaves, amounted to nearly the complete annihilation of the industry, with few planters holding onto their estates. One of the few beneficiaries was Godchot. By 1861, Leon Godchot\u2019s dry goods store was New Orleans\u2019s largest trading establishment. Capitalized on the opportunity, he acquired his first sugar plantation as the <italic>Civil War</italic> started.\nInstead, Saint-Louis, positioned as the crossroads between the North and South, free states, and slave states, became a significant trade hub. <italic>Crow McCreery Dry goods</italic> became the most prominent trader of the city. Formed by the Crow and McCreery cousins, the most prominent of whom was Thomas McCreery. A lawyer from Kentucky, McCreery had married to a distant cousin of former State Department Secretary and Senator from Kentucky, Henry Clay, and served as a Democratic presidential elector in the 1850s. After graduating from <italic>Beloit College</italic> in 1857, Indiana-born Davis Walker joined the rapidly growing firm.\nWhile some Southern states passed insolvency stays and issued bonds, the Confederacy established a constitution, bankruptcy law, and treasury. While Confederate Treasury Secretary Memminger hoped to centralize taxes and financing, most states refused and sold their bonds to state banks, fueling inflation. Christian financiers channeled British and French finance and goods. As widespread scarcity affected necessities in the Confederacy. \nTo circumvent the Union blockade, the Bibles were smuggled as contraband. So, South Carolina merchant, planter, and secessionist George Trenholm headed Liverpool\u2019s <italic>Trenholm\u2014</italic>and controlling Scottish shipper <italic>Fraser</italic>\u2014to sell the Confederacy and transport Bibles, munitions, and other essentials for gold. And as the Huguenot Lamar family continued to be influential across the South, Gazaway Lamaar financially supported the Confederacy as his blockade runners. \nAfter Massachusetts-born West Point instructor Caleb Huse resigned, President Davis appointed him as a Confederate purchasing agent, and Huse partnered with the Anglo-Jewish commission house of <italic>Isaac Campbell</italic> of London to procure and supply materials for the Confederacy. Cousin-in-laws of Katz-Samuel, Salomons, and Cohen-Barent families, <italic>Isaac</italic> <italic>Campbell</italic> parlayed cloth profits to become the largest Jewish arms dealer. Samuel Isaac, born in Chatham, started as a clothier for soldiers and sailors. In 1852, he founded <italic>Isaac Campbell</italic> with support from Dugald Campbell\u2014of the West Indies Scottish Campbell family\u2014to supply militaries during the <italic>Crimean War</italic> and subsequent conflicts.\nThe Union turned to <italic>Schuyler</italic> <italic>Hartley</italic> <italic>Graham</italic> for firearms and ammunition. Founded in 1854 by Jacob Rensselaer Schuyler, Marcellus Hartley, and Malcolm Graham, the firm focused on the import and sale of guns. While Hartley married an extended cousin of Enoch White Clark in 1857, Graham was a second cousin thrice removed of Aaron Burr. Hartley acted as an agent for the firm, supported by an unlimited line of credit from <italic>Baring</italic> in London. In 1862, he traveled to England, France, and Germany to secure contracts for arms and ammunition, successfully outbidding Confederate agents. \n<italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>-affiliated <italic>Deichmann</italic> financed extensive rifle exports to America. Despite calls from <italic>Belmont</italic>, tobacco interests, and sympathy for the South from some of the family, <italic>Rothschild</italic> advocated neutrality, arguing against British and French intervention. Still, antisemitic conspiracy theorists continued to claim <italic>Rothschild</italic> involvement. But several Jews were involved. As Louisiana followed South Carolina in seceding from the Union, Senators Judah Benjamin and John Slidell resigned from Congress in 1861. The financial brain of the Confederacy, Benjamin subsequently became the first Jew in a North American Cabinet as the Attorney-General and later Secretary of War and State. At the same time, John Slidell became Ambassador to France, where he connected with <italic>Erlanger</italic>. Led by former <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt employee, Emile Erlanger converted and married Slidell\u2019s daughter after divorcing his Laffitte wife in 1862. In doing so, Erlanger became an in-law of fellow convert August Belmont. \nA representative from the assembly that preceded Napoleon\u2019s Grand Sanhedrin, a second cousin of the Chicago banker Henry Greenbaum, and a friend of the Lehman since Europe, Lazarus Straus and his family fled Bavaria following the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, becoming the only Jews in Talbotton, Georgia, and opening a store. Like other Southern Jews, they assimilated into the culture, accepting slavery as an integral part of the Old South\u2019s social fabric, even if they privately opposed it. \nThe Straus family purchased household slaves despite their personal beliefs, driven by the pleas of enslaved Blacks. While teaching each male slave trades like shoemaking and tailoring, the Straus family reprimanded their children when disrespecting them. As a Talbotton jury blamed the Strauses for high prices, they fled to Columbus. To buy supplies for the Confederacy, Lazarus\u2019s son Isidor moved to London, and established the family\u2019s financial foundation. By 1865, Lazarus\u2019 sister-in-law married a descendant of Samuel Oppenheim in Mannheim. \nHaving emigrated from Breslau to Alabama in the 1850s, Adolph Proskauer enlisted the Confederate army, ultimately becoming one of the few Jews to achieve a high-ranking position. Fighting alongside was Isadore Untermyer, a planter co-religionist of Virginia. Conflicted holders of both of names later shaped American labor and civil rights policy. Proskauer\u2019s factor Mayer Lehman joined his brother-in-law Benjamin Newgass\u2014who had vended tobacco in Kentucky\u2014in New Orleans after the Union occupied it in 1862. By 1864, Davis appointed Lehman an Alabama Commissioner to supervise the welfare of Confederate prisoners held in New York. \nHaving recently secured their own freedom, many Jewish immigrants empathized with the Black slaves. Some actively participated in the anti-slavery abolitionist movement. Among these, Anshel Bondi\u2014descended from the Kings of Judah and the Katz family\u2014immigrated from Vienna, and supported John Brown to prevent Kansas from becoming a slave state. In 1861, Bondi enlisted in the Union army, driven by his sense of duty as a Jew to defend the institutions promoting equal rights for all beliefs. Chicago banker Lazarus Silverman advanced large sums to the Union to purchase cavalry equipment.\nAnticipating supply chain issues, Cincinnati\u2019s <italic>Procter Gamble</italic> secured rosin from New Orleans at a discount, allowing them to supply soap and candles to the Union army. Still, further supply issues drove innovations drove them to use tallow for candle making and creating Crisco. While Philip Heidelbach\u2019s daughter married merchant Simon Rindskopf of New York and <italic>Heidelbach Seasongood</italic> partnered with <italic>Kuhn</italic> <italic>Netter</italic> and <italic>Rindskopf</italic> as <italic>Heidelbach</italic> <italic>Kuhn</italic> <italic>Rindskopf</italic> to supply the Union Army. Heidelbach also founded <italic>Espy</italic> <italic>Heidelbach</italic> with a Christian to enter Cincinnati\u2019s banking sector.  \nSimilarly, the Macks joined with <italic>Stadler</italic> and <italic>Glaser</italic> as <italic>Mack</italic> <italic>Stadler</italic> <italic>Glaser</italic>. When the Union awarded uniform and blanket supply contracts in 1861, pro-Republican <italic>Mack</italic> <italic>Stadler</italic> <italic>Glaser</italic> secured Ohio\u2019s first army clothing sale. As Mack fused with several Jewish clothiers in Cincinnati, Mack\u2019s cousin-in-law wed a pro-Republican Seligman, who provided trans-continental and international financing for the Union along with <italic>Cooke</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Morton Grinnell</italic>\u2019s Levi Morton expanded into banking, founding <italic>Morton</italic> to buy UST debt and, like <italic>Speyer</italic>, branched to London. Morton\u2019s former employee Walter Burns led <italic>Morton</italic> <italic>Burns</italic> in London. While Russell Sturgis supported the Confederacy, his partner and cousin-in-law Joshua Bates backed Union agents and Thomas Baring used his position in Parliament to oppose recognition of the Confederacy. Likewise, George Peabody supported the Union from London.\nPresident Lincoln\u2019s Cabinet appointments in 1861 included William Seward as Secretary of State. A co-founder of the Republican party and organizer of law firm <italic>Blatchford Seward</italic> with his in-law, Blatchford had kinterlinkwed with <italic>Brown</italic> since 1856\u2014through the family of the Bishop of New York\u2014and Seward kinterlinked with Alex Hamilton\u2019s granddaughter in 1860. For UST Secretary, Lincoln chose Salmon Chase, Ohio\u2019s former governor and senator as well as the nephew of first Bishop of Illinois. \nContinuing to dominate British North American banking, <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> linked to the American North. Since established a New York agency in 1859, <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> opened a Chicago branch by 1861. Roosevelt-affiliated <italic>Vermilye </italic>also banked the Union. Forming <italic>Cooke</italic> in 1861, Jay Cooke joined <italic>Drexel </italic>to float Pennsylvania bonds. This impressed UST Secretary Chase, who appointed Anthony Drexel as a special agent to sell the unsold UST loan with <italic>Cooke</italic>. While <italic>Cooke</italic> sold 20% of UST bonds, about half was purchased by Anglo-Dutch Mocatta-in-law <italic>Rapha\u00ebl </italic>and Katz- and Rothschild-in-law Cohen-Barent. While failing to lead the business, the Seligmans participated in <italic>Cooke</italic>\u2019s syndicate. Bondi-cousins <italic>Knauth Nachod</italic> also exported Union bonds to Europe.\nThat year, Congress increased land and tariffs. She also allowed UST to tax income. A flat 3% on net income over $800 and 1.5% on UST bond interest. Congress had also long barred the UST from accepting bank credit. As she authorized UST to borrow in gold, bank runs led even New York\u2019s NYCH and New England\u2019s <italic>Suffolk</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> to stop convertibility. (As <italic>Suffolk</italic> never recovered, the Boston Brahmin moved their funds to <italic>Lee</italic>.) \nPresident Lincoln also signed the <italic>First Legal Tender Act</italic>, issuing unconvertible <italic>UST Demand Notes</italic> to pay UST dues. Without a central bank, the <italic>New York Clearing House</italic> (\u201cNYCH\u201d) oversaw New York banks\u2019 collateral loans on these notes. To create a trans-continental railroad, Congress\u2019 <italic>Railroad Act of 1862</italic> chartered and authorized land grants to <italic>Union Pacific</italic> (\u201cUPR\u201d) and <italic>Central Pacific</italic>. An 1864 amendment added <italic>Northern Pacific</italic>.\nAmong the hundred or so organizers of UPR in 1862 were <italic>Citi</italic><italic> Bank</italic>\u2019s Moses Tayor and <italic>Jessup</italic>. Since Morris Jessup, as extended cousins of John Morgan\u2019s father, married the daughter of Dutch Reverend Thomas Witt in 1854, an extended cousin of Patroon Rensselaer family and John Morgan\u2019s mother through the Lord family, he founded <italic>Jesup</italic>, which initially financed steam railroads and later expanded to street and electric railroads. In 1857, <italic>Jesup </italic>hired John Kendy. Born into a Presbyterian family of Lanarkshire, Scotland, Kendy worked for a Glasgow iron and coal company and was sent to America in 1850 on business. After establishing a New York branch and then managing the Glasgow branch, he joined <italic>Jesup</italic> and branched to Chicago as <italic>Jesup Kendy</italic> until resigning in 1868 to found <italic>Kendy</italic>. \nWith financing from <italic>Speyer</italic>, <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR\u2019s founders included Charles Crocker and Collis Huntington. Born in Connecticut in 1821, Collis descended from English-born Simon Huntington, who became an early settler of Norwich. Simon served as a deacon and represented Norwich in the General Court. Another ancestor, Samuel Huntington, signed the Declaration of Independence and presided over the Continental Congress. \nCollis was also a fifth cousin of Reverend John Pierpont and an extended cousin-in-law of the <italic>Phelps Dodge</italic> and Avery Rockefeller clans. After moving to New York and becoming a merchant in Oneonta by 1844, Collis married Elizabeth Stoddard, who was former VP Aaron Burr\u2019s third cousin once removed, Jay Cooke\u2019s fifth cousin, and an extended cousin-in-law of Reverend John Cotton and the Boston Brahmin Higginson family. During the <italic>Gold Rush</italic>, Collis sailed to California and later opened a successful store in Sacramento. \nBanknote inflation and the railroads monetized the silver Comstock Lode of Nevada and other Western wealth. After working a clerk on Mississippi River steamboats, Ohio-born William Ralston traveled West. Partnering with silver miners in San Francisco, forming <italic>Donohoe</italic> <italic>Ralston</italic> with Catholic banker Eugene Kelley, and by 1864 founded California\u2019s largest bank, <italic>Bank of California</italic> under the presidency of Darius Ogden Mills.\nA descendant of Emperor Charlemagne Like Mills, another notable banker of the era also hailed from upstate New York. Leonard Jerome, born in Onondaga, New York, with Huguenot and Scotch roots to a family of farmers, ministers, and lawyers. After briefly attending <italic>Princeton</italic>, he studied law in Albany and began his legal career with his uncle, Judge Jerome, in Rochester, before shifting to journalism and starting the newspaper <italic>Rochester Native American</italic>. \nFrom the 1850s, Leonard Jerome was closely associated with August Belmont \u2018Clique\u2019, which included members like Addison Cammack, Henry Clews, Jerome\u2019s cousin William Travers and others. While at first shorting in the late 1850s, Jerome longed <italic>Hudson River</italic> RR and <italic>Pacific Mail Steamship</italic> by the early 1860s.  During the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Jerome became <italic>Treasurer of the Union Defense Committee</italic> and the largest investor in the <italic>New York Times</italic>.\nSince the North occupied Nashville in 1862, Lincoln named former Tennessee Governor Andrew Johnson the Military Governor of Tennessee. Lincoln named Johnson his VP during the 1864 election. Also in 1862, Union Major General Ulysses Grant took control of the <italic>Department of the Tennessee</italic>, which spanned from Mississippi to Illinois between the Mississippi and Tennessee Rivers. \nAmidst rampant smuggling, Grant\u2019s father, Jesse, engaged in a deal with the Seligman-affiliated <italic>Mack</italic> to obtain a monopoly permit for trading with the Confederacy. When General Grant declined to support the permit, the deal collapsed, leading to legal action against <italic>Mack</italic> for breach of contract. Facing challenges in managing trade and corruption (including from his father\u2019s deal with <italic>Mack</italic>), General Grant ordered the expulsion of Jews from the area in December 1862. Although fewer than 100 people would be affected, this treatment of Jews as a single class led to outrage among Jewish leaders. \nOne of those affected was Cesar Kaskel, of Paducah, Kentucky. Born in Prussian Posen and of no known relationship to the Court Jew Kaskeles, Cesar led Paducah\u2019s <italic>Union League Club</italic>, and his brother recruited for the Union army. Like other Jews, Kaskel smuggled for the Union\u2019s benefit, smuggling from Paducah to Evansville by 1861, Following Kaskel\u2019s plea to reverse the order, President Lincoln communicated with General-in-Chief Halleck to rescind the order. After Lincoln\u2019s <italic>Emancipation Proclamation</italic> freed slaves within the Confederacy at the start of 1863. Five days later, Lincoln quietly revoked Grant\u2019s order, which Grant spent the rest of his public career atoning. By June, West Virginia seceded from Virginia. While Confederates failed to cripple <italic>PENN</italic>, the Union severed Virginia\u2019s Pennsylvania coal link. As <italic>COALB</italic> united West Virginia coal roads with Black labor, Lincoln ended slavery.\nFaced with reverses in the war in 1862, Indiana found herself sharply divided over support for the Union, with many members of the legislature sought to take the state out of the Union. Indiana\u2019s strategic location as a central corridor between East and West made it vital for Union communication and supply lines. Recognizing the critical importance of maintaining the state\u2019s allegiance, the state\u2019s Democratic governor turned to <italic>Lanier Winslow</italic> for financial assistance. Without guarantee of repayment, James Lanier (following Richard Winslow\u2019s death) agreed to an unsecured advance to support the Union cause and prevent Indiana from becoming a battleground for secession and ensuring its continued loyalty to the Union.\nSince the 1861 law failed to raise revenues, UST taxed inheritances, UST bond interest at 1.5%, and the high-income at 7.5%. And by 1864, they increased tariffs and income taxes. Oil production and export soared as Congress taxed alcohol, alcoholic lamp fuels, and kerosene alike. (<italic>Rothschild</italic> was the primary distributor in Europe and <italic>Schepeler</italic> New York for a time were the heaviest exporters.) Since British common law courts \u2018right of capture\u2019 allows only top-soil ownership of coal and water. Since each top-soil owner has unlimited withdrawal rights, well owners ran on the sub-soil oil. As coal and oil competed, coal prices fell relative to wood. Cheap coal stimulated steel for railroads. Connected to <italic>COALB </italic>through DeLancey cousins, Eckley Coxe became among the largest Pennsylvania coal miners.\nOver 100 oil refineries soon popped up, with over 25 in Cleveland alone. After serving as a grocer\u2019s clerk, William Elkins established a produce firm by 1856. His entrepreneurial spirit led him to build the first large refrigerator in Philadelphia in 1860, to achieve the largest produce business. In 1861, inspired by the oil boom, Elkins ventured into Pennsylvania\u2019s oil fields. In 1862, he constructed his inaugural petroleum refinery, soon competing with several refineries, including one founded by a Seixas-in-law. \nAnd in Cleveland from 1864, Oliver Payne, a <italic>Civil War</italic> veteran and <italic>Yale</italic> graduate, who became involved in iron manufacturing before pioneering oil refining, competed with many others, including his fellow descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, John Davison Rockefeller. Rockefeller\u2019s co-founder was Oliver Burr Jennings. Born in Connecticut, Jennings was a second cousin twice removed of former VP and <italic>Manhattan Co Bank</italic>-founder Aaron Burr and second cousin of Jay Gould. Moving first to New York to work in the dry goods trade and then to California in 1849, Oliver returned to New York in 1862, and his sister-in-law married William Rockefeller in 1864.\nCongress also inflated circulating UST<italic> legal tender notes</italic> (\u201cUSLTN\u201d) to tax lower incomes. When banks suspended gold convertibility in 1861, notes from<italic> State-regulated banks</italic> (\u201cSBs\u201d) competed with USLTN for seigniorage. Congress built a UST bond market by combining New York\u2019s bank law with central banking into the <italic> &</italic>  (\u201cNBA\u201d). \nWhile <italic>American Exchange Bank</italic>\u2019s George Coe, <italic>Merchants</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic> Bank</italic>\u2019s Jacob Vermilye, and others spoke out against bank nationalization fearing inflation, leading Republicans John Stevens of <italic>Bank of Commerce</italic>, Moses Taylor of Astor-owned <italic>Citi Bank</italic>, and Moses Howland Grinnell supported the legislation. Unlike SBs, NBA created <italic>National Banks</italic> (\u201cNBs\u201d). UST regulated and deposited funds into NBs. Still, Boston and New York notes were worth more. So, Congress ordered NBs to receive NB notes at par, creating national <italic>dollar</italic> parity. \nIn 1863, Jay Cooke secured the first NB charter, forming <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>Philadelphia</italic> and then <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of DC</italic>\u2014under the leadership of Cooke\u2019s brother Henry\u2014which intermediated between <italic>Comptroller of the Currency</italic> and other NBs. While Cooke led the chartering of <italic>Fourth</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>, John Thompson had organized <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> as the 29th chartered NB.  A descendant of Emperor Charlemagne and second cousin twice removed of John Hancock, Thompson\u2019s son Frederick had married a daughter of New York Governor Myron Clark, an extended cousin of <italic>Clark</italic><italic> </italic>bankers. After the governorship, Clark moved to Detroit in 1859 and organized <italic>Michigan</italic><italic> </italic>SB. Along with <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic>, Frederick organized <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Detroit</italic>, which soon merged with <italic>Michigan</italic><italic> </italic>SB, where the Clarks continued to lead.\nAlthough newer banks and politically connected banks converted, older, conservative banks did not. In Boston, for example, <italic>Safety Fund Bank</italic> from 1859 became <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Boston</italic><italic> </italic>in 1863, but <italic>Massachusetts Bank</italic> of Boston, did not.  NBs particularly spread through risky coal country. In Scranton, Pennsylvania, business leaders secured charters for two banks, the <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Scranton</italic> and <italic>Second</italic> NB <italic>of Scranton</italic>. Leaders from the <italic>Lackawanna Iron & Coal Co</italic>, <italic>Delaware & Hudson Canal Co</italic>, and <italic>Delaware, Lackawanna & Western</italic> RR led the effort as well as <italic>Citi</italic> of New York and <italic>Blair</italic>\u2019s <italic>Belvidere</italic><italic> </italic>of New Jersey.\nIn Marion County, Ohio, <italic>Farmer\u2019s Bank of Marion</italic> reorganized as <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Marion</italic>, and Abraham Monnett remained President as he dealt in cattle, hogs, and sheep. After two generations of running <italic>Bank of Rhode Island</italic>, Newport\u2019s Clarkes converted it into NB of <italic>Rhode Island</italic>, and continued to run and control it. One of the founders of NB <italic>of</italic> <italic>Rhode Island</italic> sent his son to clerk for <italic>American Exchange Bank</italic>, which George Coe soon converted into an NB. Likewise, James Fargo\u2014brother of Charles of <italic>Wells</italic> and <italic>American Express</italic>\u2014co-founded and served as a Director <italic>of</italic> <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Chicago</italic>. As Northern generals recruited free Southern Black soldiers and labors, they paid salaries through mandatory military savings banks from 1864. \n<italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Nashville</italic> was organized in 1863 during the Civil War, becoming the South\u2019s first NB. <italic>Second</italic> and <italic>Third</italic> NBs soon followed. Founding the only Jewish-owned bank in Nashville, brothers Julius and Max Sax immigrated from Prussia and opened a brokerage in Nashville in 1863, they received a charter for <italic>Nashville Savings Bank</italic><italic> </italic>in 1866. While Max married a granddaughter of the organizer of Nashville\u2019s Jewish community, Julius wed a descendant of Uriah Hendricks\u2019 sister and her Oppenheim husband. <italic>Nashville Savings Bank</italic><italic> </italic>maintained European correspondents and became the city\u2019s largest handler of transcontinental business.\nWithout a central bank or branching options, NBA counted NYCH dues as NB reserves. As correspondent banks exchanged these dues, NYCH banks intermediated inter-state and -national credit. To follow usury caps, banks shifted correspondent fiscal agency prices. In other words, they substituted illegal usurious interest payments with discounted correspondent services. Finally, NBs became the only entities permitted inter-state federal bankruptcy rights. \nNBA limited leverage with reserve requirements. To issue notes, NBs had to deposit UST bonds with UST at a 10% haircut. And\u2014like New York\u2019s free<italic> </italic>incorporation law did generally\u2014NBA set double liability on shareholders. (States held bank stockholders liable for defaults to reduce risk.) In 1864, UST Secretary Chase appointed the former Head of <italic>Indiana</italic> SB, Hugh McCulloch, as UST\u2019s inaugural Comptroller of the Currency. (After Lincoln promoted Chase to the Court, McCulloch became UST Secretary following a short stint by William Fessenden.)\nBefore NBA, SBs issued banknotes, held reserves to convert notes into gold on demand, and invested in stocks. Savings bank<italic> trusts</italic> restricted investments, but held no reserves since they did not pay out on-demand. Since state regulation declined after NBA. To compete with NBs, SBs innovated deposits as arbitrage against the SB note 1865 tax. Within a decade, SBs claimed more deposits than NBs. While stable NB notes secured currency, deposit-dependence resurfaced panics. \nSince <italic>Rothschild</italic> London continued to be neutral, <italic>Erlanger</italic> marketed Confederate cotton-collateralized bonds with Slidell from 1863. While <italic>Erlanger</italic> sold in London and Paris, with Britain\u2019s Chancellor of the <italic>Exchequer</italic> Gladstone subscribed, and <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> entering the government loan market as <italic>Trenholm Fraser</italic> deposited the proceeds in Liverpool. <italic>Rothschild</italic> Frankfurt\u2019s Carl Meyer refused to be involved, saying that no Frankfurt Jews support a slaveholding government. By 1864, <italic>Rothschild</italic> financed Union imports from Europe, criticizing Erlanger-in-law and Slidell-in-law <italic>Belmont</italic> for not assisting Lincoln\u2019s government.\nThe same year, Confederate President Davis named George Trenholm Treasury Secretary. As Confederate war losses spread inflation, Trenholm was imprisoned for several months before receiving a presidential pardon. Crushed by the death of his wife and son, Gazaway Lamaar he sold his interests in blockade runners as General Sherman entered Savannah in 1865 and sought safety under President Lincoln\u2019s 1863 amnesty proclamation. However, he was arrested under suspicion of involvement in Lincoln\u2019s assassination, leading to brief imprisonment and later legal issues related to reclaiming his seized property.\nAlthough Texans Charles Stillman and Francisco Yturria fled Union troops to Matamoros, Mexico, in 1863, the Union allowed them to continue trading cotton and they multiplied their fortunes. By 1865, Stillman launch <italic>San Antonio</italic> NB as Congress ended free<italic> </italic>banks with a SB note tax. Like <italic>Massachusetts Bank</italic> of Boston become <italic>Massachusetts</italic> NB, NBs spread across the South. While Mobile, Alabama, had three banks in 1865\u2014<italic>Southern Bank of Alabama</italic>, <italic>Mobile Savings Bank</italic>, and <italic>Bank of Mobile</italic>\u2014Mobile citizens organized <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Mobile</italic> in 1865.\nWith the death of around 800,000 free Americans and 200,000 slaves between warfare and disease, another 20,000 Confederate loyalists fled to Brazil, which welcomed their plantation experience. While former President Davis was arrested, Judah Benjamin fled to Britain, where he became a lawyer. As Northern generals recruited free Southern Black soldiers and labors, they paid salaries through mandatory military savings banks from 1864. Among the first efforts at <italic>Reconstruction</italic> following the Civil War, Congress established the broadly empowered <italic>Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, & Abandoned Lands</italic> in 1865. The <italic>Bureau</italic>\u2019s Tennessee education superintendent, for example, established <italic>Fisk Uni</italic> in Nashville to support education for newly emancipated Blacks. \nBy 1866, the Army Paymaster and a Congregational minister with ties to General Sherman persuaded Congress to charter <italic>Freedman Saving & Trust </italic>to consolidate protect the savings of unclaimed deposits of Black soldiers and to serve the financial interests of the emancipated race. From <italic>Military Bank</italic> of Norfolk, Virginia, <italic>Freedman</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s inaugural branch opened in DC in 1865. Within months, branches were established in Louisville, Richmond, Nashville, Wilmington, Huntsville, Memphis, Mobile, and Vicksburg. Expanding to 14 branches within a year and 34 by 1871, with 32 located in southern states. <italic>Freedman </italic>was controlled by White Republicans in New York City as a public <italic>trust</italic>, with few Blacks employed. \nStill, Blacks succeeded in politics and business. Earlier in Virginia, a Scottish tobacco plantation master and his Black house slave reared Blanche Bruce from 1841. While his brother established a grocery store in Kansas after the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Blanche had unsuccessful nominations for postmaster and doorkeeper for the Mississippi House of Representatives by 1870. Despite these setbacks, Bruce became tax assessor of Bolivar County in 1871 and secured a position on the Levee Board to address flooding along the Mississippi and Arkansas Rivers. Some also invested in and joined <italic>Freedman Savings & Trust Co</italic> as directors.\nBy 1870, James Wormley, a former caterer, established a luxury hotel in DC. Another hotel entrepreneur, Henry Harding, was a former slave and hotel owner, and invested in <italic>Freedman Savings & Trust Co</italic>. Once a bondsman and barber, James Thomas became the South\u2019s third richest Black by buying real estate across Saint-Louis, Memphis, and Nashville. \nBorn in Alabama in a free Black family, James Rapier attended a Black private school in Nashville before the Civil War, when he fled to Canada, until becoming a cotton farmer in Maury County, Tennessee, in 1865. Engaging in Republican politics, he served as director of <italic>Freedman Savings & Trust Co</italic> in Montgomery, founded the <italic>Republican Sentinel</italic> newspaper in 1872, when he was elected to Congress. Born a slave, James Thomas gained freedom by 1842, and became one of Saint-Louis\u2019 wealthiest Blacks through real estate investments. Along with marrying into a land-rich mulatto family in 1868, Thomas directed <italic>Freedman Savings & Trust Co</italic> Saint-Louis.\nAfter the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Louisiana sugar planters adopted portable mills due to a capital shortage, combining sugar agriculture and manufacturing. The number of these mills grew from 8 in 1868 and peaked at 90 in 1871. Until the emergence of central sugarhouses in the second decade after the war, few large sugar plantations were divided into smaller tracts. Since acquiring his first sugar plantation at the outset of the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Leon Godchot bought more and introduced a vertical organization and central factories to streamline sugar production and replace individual plantation sugar houses. Along with centralizing operations, Godchot later set up additional central sugar factories and rail systems to transport cane.\nHowever, Congress limited timber and mining in the Deep South with LA1866. As courts voided Southern debt stays, conflicts grew. Congress\u2019 <italic>Reconstruction</italic> acts restored the Union and protected Blacks. Allowing bankruptcy, BA1867 deferred to state exemptions. The South accounted for 50% of voluntary filers, but 30% of the population. One of the filers was George Trenholm, who thereafter regained his fortune and returned to political power by 1874. Another early filer was SBUS\u2019 early advocate and <italic>War of 1812</italic> financier Jacob Barker.\nBut the bankruptcy legislation was toxic. BA1867 applied to railroads, insurers, SBs, and public utilities that later laws exempted to stabilize commerce. As BA1867 subjected two-week debt nonpayment to involuntary bankruptcy, panic spread illiquidity. One of the largest failures was of Leonard Jerome with the depreciation of <italic>Pacific Mail Steamship</italic>. Although Jerome departed from Wall Street, his daughter married British statesman Lord Randolph Churchill-Spencer several years later.\nAnd with the death of the senior partner, <italic>Prime</italic>\u2019s successor firm and <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s agent dissolved. So, railroads and other firms with fixed assets ruinously competed. Since debt servicing did not vary with traffic and increased, firms lowered wages and profit margins to attract traffic. So, businesses fixed prices to avoid overproduction under BA1867. However, the crisis also presented opportunities for other bankers to consolidate.\nAfter the <italic>Civil War</italic>, <italic>Crow McCreery Drygoods</italic> of Saint-Louis accepted Davis Walker as a partner by 1865 and Frank Ely joined the firm. Their work accelerated as former UST Secretary James Guthrie resigned as Senator from Kentucky and Thomas McCreery ascended the post from 1868. Over the following years, Frank Ely married McCreery\u2019s niece, and Davis Walker reorganized the firm as <italic>Ely Walker</italic>, which soon grew into the Midwest\u2019s largest dry goods wholesaler. For decades, Lehman and Newgass continued brokering cotton and other commodities, with Adolph Proskauer and his brother Alfred as one of their commission agents. \nTo avoid profit sharing with the subsidized trans-continental roads, American telegraphs built their own wire during the <italic>Civil War</italic>. With funding from Vanderbilt, <italic>Western Union</italic> became the only trans-national telegraph. While Congress sought to nationalize telegraphs, USPO warned otherwise. So, Congress stimulated competition instead. Under the <italic>Post Roads Act of 1866</italic>, Congress granted all telegraphs access to build across public land. The same year, James Scrymser\u2014who had married a descendant of <italic>Prime</italic>\u2019s Nathaniel Prime<italic>, </italic>New York\u2019s first private banker\u2014promoted <italic>International Ocean Telegraph </italic>as the first cable to Latin America, linking Florida and Havana. Since financing British <italic>Reuter</italic> in the 1850s, <italic>Erlanger</italic> banked their first trans-Atlantic French cable firm to connect Brest to the Saint-Lawrence River in 1869. \nAfter the war, <italic>Cooke</italic> and other bankers closed their DC offices, increasing bank competition in New York. Likewise, New York and European capitals linked to trade California\u2019s gold. After <italic>Agra Masterman </italic>converted an old San Francisco bank into <italic>British California</italic><italic> </italic>in 1864, John Morgan co-founded <italic>London & San Francisco Bank</italic> with <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>, <italic>Stern</italic>, <italic>Sulzbach</italic>, <italic>Glyn</italic>, and <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen </italic>in 1865. As the founders allowed only allowed ten investors, only admitted<italic> Russell</italic><italic> </italic>in 1869. By then, the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic> brought down <italic>Agra </italic><italic>Masterman</italic>, and <italic>British California</italic><italic> </italic>along with her.\nHowever, the death of his Sturges wife led Morgan to marry Frances Tracy, a <italic>Lee</italic> cousin and a third cousin once removed of <italic>Central Pacific</italic> RR\u2019s Collis Huntington. Two years later, Morgan\u2019s sister Mary wed Walter Burns of<italic> Morton</italic> London, led by Levi Morton, Morgan\u2019s third cousin once removed. Although the relationship between <italic>Morgan</italic> and <italic>Morton</italic> continued, Burns resigned after his marriage, and Canadian Minister of Finance John Rose filled his position. Burns later became a partner in his father-in-law Junius Morgan\u2019s London house. Originally from Scotland, Rose continued to direct <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> and <italic>Bank of British Columbia,</italic> as <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic> faced competition from <italic>Royal Bank of Canada </italic>and<italic> Canadian Bank of Commerce</italic>.\nIn 1864, <italic>Drexel</italic> added John Robinson. Born in Wilmington, Delaware, his father was Robert Robinson, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, whose third cousins were Joseph Shipley of <italic>Brown Shipley</italic> and Rebecca Pennock Lukens of <italic>Brandywine Iron Works & Nail Factory</italic>. The Robinsons were tobacconists until 1849, when they established private bank <italic>Robinson</italic>. By 1865, Joseph Drexel married the daughter of Thomas Lloyd Wharton, whose relatives included <italic>Bethlehem Iron</italic>\u2019s Joseph Wharton, <italic>Lloyd</italic>, <italic>Hottinguer</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Blake</italic>, and the British aristocracy. By 1868, <italic>Drexel</italic> hired former Consul of in Philadelphia Bremen John Harjes to lead <italic>Drexel</italic> Paris.\nAs <italic>Cooke</italic> and <italic>Clark</italic> jointly financed bonds, Clark gained control of Pennsylvania\u2019s <italic>Lehigh</italic> coal RHC by 1867. Similarly, aristocratic and religious marriages linked British bankers. While Adeane sisters married <italic>Smyth</italic>\u2019s Robert Smyth, BOE director Hugh Smyth, and Henry Grenfell, Henry\u2019s second cousin Marie Grenfell married the son of Reverend Pearce-Serocold and his Smyth wife. Since Smyths had married his cousins in 1711 and 1824, a descendant of Henry Thornton joined <italic>Smyth</italic> in 1869, and married a Grenfell two years later.\nWhile Newton Saint-John returned to head of <italic>Saint-John Powers</italic> in Mobile, Alabama, as <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s Southern agent following the death of <italic>Prime</italic> cousin Archibald Gracie. his daughter wed Lawrence Alexander (not closely related to the Kentucky family) in 1866, after the latter shuttered his Saint-Louis dry goods business to start <italic>Alexander</italic> bank in New York. Within a year, Newton\u2019s son William became a clerk with <italic>Alexander</italic>. Around the same time, Newton Saint-John\u2019s fourth cousin Sam built his dry goods and grocery merchant business into a private bank that rated among the largest financial institutions of Canada\u2019s Niagara Region. \nPartially because <italic>Rothschild</italic> avoided American state and railroad debt after the <italic>Civil War</italic>, other Jewish bankers thrived. Along with six other attempts, Jewish merchants Spiegelberg and Seligmann failed to receive congressional approval since the passage of NBA and New Mexican statehood in 1863. But Jewish wealth in New Mexico paled in comparison to Lucien Menard Maxwell and other Christian real estate magnates. In 1865, the Seligman family founded <italic>Seligman</italic>, which quickly became a major player in Wall Street finance. Although <italic>Seligman</italic> left Alabama prior to the Civil War, brother-in-law Max Hellman opened <italic>Seligman</italic> New Orleans after the war. \nLikewise, <italic>Heidelbach</italic> <italic>Kuhn</italic> <italic>Rindskopf</italic> became the largest clothing manufacturer in the Mississippi Valley by 1864 before disassociating. After the war, Philip Heidelbach moved to New York in 1865 and. While Heidelbach later promoted <italic>Cincinnati Southern</italic> RR in 1869 and served as a director of <italic>Little Miami</italic> RR, Seasongood opened a private bank in 1870 that became one of Cincinnati\u2019s leading financial institutions. \n<italic>Kuhn Netter </italic>also transitioned from textiles to banking. While Samuel Kuhn, Jacob Netter, and an in-law opened a private bank in Cincinnati, Abraham Kuhn, Loeb, and his cousin Samuel Wolff founded <italic>Kuhn Loeb</italic> (\u201c<italic>Kuhn</italic>\u201d) in New York by 1867. Jacob Netter\u2019s sons apprenticed with <italic>Kuhn</italic> in New York, where they opened a partnership by 1872. Although <italic>Mack</italic> and their in-laws also relocated to New York, they remained clothiers. Also in 1872, a Netter-in-law Seasongood married a Fechheimer, whose sister wed a brother-in-law of Chicago\u2019s Lazarus Silverman.\nHaving funded railroads before the <italic>Civil War</italic>, Boston capitalists developed Midwestern finance. Descended from the 1st Earl of Argyll, the Blair family engaged in preaching, teaching, and landownership in America from the early 18th century. James Blair was born in Sussex (now Warren) County, New Jersey. At 15, he became a store clerk, and at 18, in 1825, he opened his own store in Marksboro, which he ran for over 40 years. \nIn 1831, he and his brother John-Insley founded <italic>Belvidere Bank</italic>, with John as President and James as Director. In the 1850s, John-Insley promoted <italic>Galena & Chicago Union </italic>RR with Ames and James joined <italic>Lackawanna Iron & Coal </italic><italic>Co </italic>and <italic>Delaware, Lackawanna & Western </italic>RR. In 1860, James moved to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and in 1866, he relocated permanently. He helped incorporate the first street railway in Scranton, serving as President, and co-founded <italic>Scranton Savings Ban</italic><italic>k</italic>. After he became a Director of <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Scranton</italic>, his daughter married another director.\nThe brothers continued investing into railroads, including <italic>Iowa, Cedar Rapids & Missouri</italic> RR, <italic>Iowa Falls & Sioux City</italic> RR, <italic>Sioux City & Pacific</italic> RR, and <italic>Fremont, Elkhorn & Missouri Valley</italic> RR, all of which later merged into <italic>Chicago & Northwestern</italic><italic> </italic>RR. The brothers\u2019 third cousin, Massachusetts-born Chauncey ventured west in 1835, engaging in land sales in the Midwest. Partnering with his brother, Lyman, they established <italic>CB&L Blair</italic>, a grain business out of Michigan City. \nChauncey transitioned to banking, leading <italic>Union Plank Road Co</italic> and later becoming involved in railroad building. In 1861, he moved to Chicago, initiating a private bank, and in 1865, he organized <italic>Merchants</italic> NB. A financial leader, he played a pivotal role during the <italic>Great Fire of 1871</italic>, insisting on full payment to depositors, solidifying Chicago\u2019s credit. The Blairs competed with American-born Scot William Mitchell, who built <italic>Alton</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>S</italic><italic>aint-</italic><italic>Louis</italic> RR, and helped organize <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Alton</italic>. In 1873, he co-founded <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings Bank</italic> in Chicago.\nChicago\u2019s Jewish bankers also aided the city. While Lazarus Silverman funded housing and nourishment, <italic>Greenbaum</italic> sold real-estate bonds in Europe to helped rebuild the charred city. Greenbaums also founded New York bank and brokerage <italic>Greenbaum </italic>New York, their cousin Ernst Thalmann, whose father was a prominent Mannheim merchant, emigrated to America in 1867 and joined <italic>Greenbaum</italic> New York before he left to study finance in Europe.  \nMeanwhile, <italic>Russell</italic> heirs completed <italic>Michigan Central</italic> RR into Chicago and linked to the Mississippi to form the future <italic>Chicago</italic>, <italic>Burlington & Quincy </italic>RR. Since his father married the daughter of Thomas-Handasyd Perkins, Alex Agassiz married George Russell\u2019s daughter. While one of Alex\u2019s sisters wed a sister of <italic>Lee</italic>\u2019s Henry Higginson, another married Quincy Shaw, the son of an old Boston mercantile family. From 1866, Agassiz and Shaw controlled Michigan\u2019s <italic>Calumet</italic> copper mine. \nAnd since <italic>Prime</italic>\u2019s successor bank dissolved in 1867 with the death of the senior partner, <italic>Prime</italic> cousin Archibald Gracie\u2019s daughter wed Henry Higginson\u2019s brother in 1869. Other Midwestern bankers had similar backgrounds. Norman Harris, born in Massachusetts, descended from Emperor Charlemagne and Puritan colonists, Norman started his business career at 18 as a soliciting agent for a LIC in Cincinnati, Ohio. By 1867, he organized <italic>Union Central</italic> LIC in that city. \nDeflation spread as Congress repealed taxes on coal and steel in 1866 and for cotton, spirits, oil, and banks in 1868. Low-taxed spirits distillers sold in New York at 24 cents before 1862. By 1864, taxes reached $2.00. While distilling fell after the first three hikes, activity boomed as tax advances became likely. Speculators accumulated alcohol in anticipation as new taxes were not retroactive. The boom ended with the war. So, Midwestern distillery cartels limited production by 1870. Coal prices fell as the Court denied cartel contracts in 1866. So, Pennsylvania roads bought shares in competitors and signed a New York <italic>trust</italic> agreement. But as <italic>Barclay Coal</italic> cut prices, New York\u2019s court refused restrain trade and enforce the contract in 1871. \nBorn to a wealthy Puritan farmer in Connecticut, Jay Gould descended from Abraham Gold, who emigrated from England in 1647 to become Fairfield\u2019s richest residents. Gold\u2019s descendant Nathan later wed a relative of VP Aaron Burr, related to John Morgan\u2019s Sturges wife and the wife of <italic>Central Pacific </italic>RR\u2019s Collis Huntington. Another Gold changed his name to Gould and, unlike his mercantile family, became a farmer. Not wanting to be a farmer, Jay became a trader. Partnering with <italic>Seligman</italic>, Gould gained control of <italic>Erie</italic> RR, and cartelized oil cartel with <italic>Atlantic</italic> in 1867. However, a rate war erupted when <italic>PENN</italic> sponsored another pipe. As <italic>Atlantic </italic>RR broke away to partner with Vanderbilt and <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>PENN</italic> bought other pipes. By 1868, these systems joined with one of the oil refineries, including John Rockefeller, agreeing not to compete. \nRailroads remained within state until 1869. As Gould grew <italic>Erie</italic> RR from New York into Chicago, Vanderbilt followed. Fearing takeover by <italic>Baltimore & Ohio </italic>RR, Virginia roads from Chattanooga coal to the Port of Norfolk fused. In reaction to Gould and Vanderbilt, Pennsylvania chartered several RHCs. She first amended <italic>PENN</italic>\u2019s charter to buy <italic>Richmond </italic>RR<italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic>expand into Illinois with <italic>Drexel</italic> financing.\nRockefeller helped start Pennsylvania\u2019s second RHC. As the RHC linked rebates for bulk shipments\u2014legal in Britain since 1858\u2014Rockefeller pressured refineries to sell to his <italic>OIL</italic>. After Pennsylvania dissolved the RHC for price discrimination, ruinous competition fueled<italic> OIL</italic>. As Cleveland\u2019s Oliver Payne refiner fused with <italic>OIL </italic>in 1872, Payne soon served as <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s top executive and banker. Similarly, Philadelphia\u2019s William Elkins partnered with <italic>OIL</italic> by 1873. \n<italic>Schepeler </italic>New York\u2019s expectation that UST sales would depress gold prices led them to continue selling at contracted low prices, but rising prices resulted in significant losses. By defaulting on margin loans, <italic>Schepeler </italic>New York prompted brokers to unwind liabilities and shift from stocks to bonds, and long gold. <italic>Budge Schiff</italic> was among the casualties in May as the <italic>Panic of 1869 </italic>started. While USLTN gold value grew from the 70s to 90, creditors challenged UST\u2019s law to accept USLTN and NBA\u2019s tax on SB notes in October. \nWhile the Court deliberated, Gould, <italic>Seligman</italic>, and President Grant\u2019s brother-in-law began trying to corner gold. Although <italic>Hallgarten</italic> and several bankers supported UST, more investors shorted USLTN until President Grant told the syndicate to cease, and the price of gold collapsed. By yearend, the Court allowed creditors to reject USLTN, spurring a run. President Grant immediately added two judges. But as judicial arguments ended, legislative bills to outlaw USLTN grew. After eliminating inheritance and reducing income taxes, Congress repealed the tax. Even as they reduced tariffs, deflation canceled the effect. And as UST reduced debt, the money market refocused from MMUST on NYSE collateral loans, MMSEC.\nAmidst the <italic>Franco-Prussian War</italic><italic> of 1870</italic>, <italic>Drexel</italic> Paris sent her French gold to Geneva and continued allowing checks drawn on it in <italic>marks</italic> and <italic>francs</italic>. <italic>Speyer</italic> New York sent Haim Salomon\u2019s Alabama-born great-grandson William Salomon, a cousin of the Hendricks and Hart families, to <italic>Speyer</italic> London, where his Katz-descendant Samuel cousin was later elected to British Parliament. Likewise, Jay Cooke set up a London bank with former UST Secretary Hugh McCulloch and re-organized his <italic>Civil War</italic> syndicate to refinance UST bonds in 1870, with Anglo-Dutch Mocatta-in-law <italic>Rapha\u00ebl</italic>, Katz- and Rothschild-in-law Cohen-Barent, and <italic>Seligman</italic> again being the largest participants. \nLikewise, Jay Cooke\u2019s brother Henry, President of Cooke\u2019s DC bank, <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of</italic> <italic>DC</italic>, became the first a Governor of DC and relocated and absorbed <italic>Freedman Saving & Trust</italic>, the federal bank for free slaves from New York. Around the same time, Cooke\u2019s daughter married Charles Dennis Barney. While one of Barney\u2019s extended cousins, Ashbel Barney, was a director of <italic>Wells Fargo</italic> and Cooke\u2019s <italic>Northern Pacific</italic><italic> </italic>RR, another cousin, Charles Tracy Barney, was the son of a banker and second cousin of John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife. \nWhen his first partner Dabney retired in 1870, John considered retiring at 33. However, as <italic>Drexel</italic> sought to expand reach from Philadelphia, New York, and Paris to the London market, they approached John\u2019s father Junius, who had gained recognition for his management of the French Loan of 1870, and proposed for John to become a junior partner in their New York office, creating <italic>Drexel Morgan</italic> (\u201c<italic>Morgan</italic>\u201d). Within a year, Drexel\u2019s son wed the last SBUS President Nicholas Biddle\u2019s daughter. However, Drexel\u2019s partner Robert Winthrop left to start <italic>Winthrop</italic>, breaking Drexel\u2019s kinterlink with <italic>Citi</italic> President Moses Taylor and <italic>Belmont</italic>.\nBut <italic>Morgan</italic> faced competition. Already in 1870, William Dominick, an extended cousin-in-law of the Patroon brokerage<italic> </italic>Rensselaer, relocated back to his birth city of Chicago shortly after joining NYSE, and co-founded stock <italic>Dominick Dickerman</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Continental Bank & Trust </italic>started with investors including Jacob Schiff, <italic>Seligman</italic>, <italic>Claffin</italic> (America\u2019s largest wholesale dry goods), <italic>Livingston Cutting </italic>(a Knickerbocker descendant of Schuyler, Livingston, and Fulton and a cousin-in-law of<italic> Phelps Dodge</italic>), and banker <italic>Hartley</italic>, a descendant of British royals who endowed the <italic>Smithsonian</italic>. By 1871, a Rensselaer married Phelps.\nAnd in railroads, like Vanderbilt\u2019s consolidations eased the transport of produce from the Midwestern to cities and ports, Jay Gould leveraged his <italic>Erie</italic> RR in a hostile takeover of <italic>Albany & Susquehanna</italic> RR for direct sales of anthracite coal to New England. Likewise, <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> funded McHenry\u2019s comeback at <italic>Atlantic & Great Western </italic>RR, overseeing the issuance of reorg stock by 1871. \nMcHenry and Jay Gould, reportedly employed bribery tactics, leading to Gould\u2019s removal as the President of <italic>Erie</italic> RR in March 1872. While <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic>\u2019s Watts Sherman remained on <italic>Erie</italic>\u2019s board, <italic>Erie </italic>RR replaced Junius Morgan as London financial agent their London with <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>. <italic>Erie</italic> then elected a <italic>Prime</italic> cousin as her new President. Still, Gould, <italic>Seligman</italic>, and their allies consolidated roads into a new trans-continental, <italic>Saint-Louis-San Francisco</italic> RR.\nWith the foundation of <italic>Deutsche</italic><italic> Bank</italic> in 1870, among her most prominent Jewish founders was Hermann Marcuse, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>\u2019s former New York agent. Having first joined Gustav Bawer, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>\u2019s first agent, Marcuse succeeded the retiring Bawer in 1859 as agent, formed <italic>Marcuse Baltzer</italic>, and became a director of <italic>Germania </italic>LIC in New York. By 1865, Marcuse retired from active banking in New York and <italic>Baltzer Tacks </italic>replaced <italic>Marcuse Baltzer</italic>. After co-founded <italic>Deutsche</italic>, Marcuse positioned his nephew Paul Lichtenstein, who had emigrated to America from Frankfurt in 1866, as the bank\u2019s New York agent in 1872. That year, Lichtenstein married the Protestant daughter of Friedrich Kapp, New York\u2019s Commissioner of Immigration and member of <italic>Deutsche</italic>\u2019s Board alongside Marcuse. <italic>Lichtenstein </italic>soon invested in petroleum and other American ventures. \nBy 1869, Max Hellman left <italic>Seligman</italic> New Orleans in the care of his brother\u2014who married Joseph Seligman\u2019s daughter and soon became a director of <italic>Union Bank</italic> and <italic>Louisiana</italic> NB\u2014and became a partner at the new <italic>Seligman</italic> Paris. Within a year, Bernard Seligmann partnered with Quaker and British capitalists to construct the coal road <italic>Denver & Rio Grande</italic> RR. \nAfter Maxwell obtained a bank charter for <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New Mexico</italic> in Santa-Fe in 1870, the Spiegelbergs chartered <italic>Second</italic> NB <italic>of New Mexico</italic> in 1872 and Levi Spiegelberg\u2019s brother wed Joseph Seligman\u2019s daughter. Although other Jewish merchants did not join them in the bank, the Spiegelbergs appointed the archbishop\u2019s nephew to a directorship. As Joseph Seligman banked the new President Grant, serving as fiscal agent for State Department<italic> </italic>and the Navy, but he refused to lead UST.\nWhile cousin-in-law Isaiah Hellman of Bavaria had married Esther Newgass, Esther\u2019s sister married to Mayer Lehman, and his client Hellman established Los Angeles\u2019 first bank in 1868, later known as <italic>Farmers & Merchants Bank</italic>. Within a year, John Mackay and other Irish-born miners of Nevada\u2019s Comstock Load, challenged <italic>Bank of California</italic> monopoly. \nBy 1873, <italic>Seligman</italic> allied with HSBC\u2019s <italic>Sassoon</italic> to form <italic>Anglo</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>California Bank</italic>, they soon split the California gold trade with <italic>Lazard</italic> and <italic>London & San Francisco Bank</italic> of 1865. The same year, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s bonds with New York finance strengthened as a Cohen-Barent cousin of <italic>Joseph</italic> and <italic>Wagg</italic> stock brokers married the daughter of Benjamin Seixas Hart and his wife Hannah Hendricks.\nTrans-continental railroads also faced uncertainty from protectionist states. To lobby for federal oversight, UPR imitated the French <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> with an unaffiliated <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> (\u201cCM\u201d). UPR then distributed shares to the VP and Congressmen. In 1872, Congress reduced tariffs and eliminated income and inheritance taxes from the<italic> Civil War</italic>. After LA1862 regulated agricultural federal land sales, Congress sold mineral and coal lands with LA1872 and LA1873. \nRuinous coal competition led Pennsylvania to require charters for mining from 1873. Her third RHC, <italic>COALA</italic>, vertically integrated anthracite. Without federal regulation, Massachusetts forced coal roads to charge unprofitable rates. As <italic> </italic>alleged CM bribery in 1872, courts exonerated most officials. Still, Congress directed DOJ to sue UPR and passed the <italic>CM Act </italic>in March 1873 as UPR overcharged UST. In an act the Court later held to impair UPR\u2019s contract, Congress forbade UPR from securing new debt by assets with UST liens. \nAs American and German industry inflated coal, high prices spurred Austrian Silesia to industrialize, and over a thousand British mines opened. Prices of British goods inflated as Parliament limited labor hours. Moreover, financial innovation accelerated the flow of European capital into America. After <italic>British</italic><italic> Companies Act</italic><italic> of </italic><italic>1862</italic>, Samuel Laing\u2014who served as private secretary for Henry Baring Labouchere and then cooperated in investments with <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2014and Philip Rose\u2014 Benjamin Disraeli\u2019s legal and financial agent\u2014helped form and manage <italic>General Credit & Finance Co</italic>, a cr\u00e9dit mobilier to act as an investment principal, like <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale </italic>in France. \nBuilding on this experience, in 1868 they founded <italic>Foreign </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Colonial Government Trust</italic>, with <italic>Glyn</italic> as banker and trustees including <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s George Currie and Eustace Cecil, son of Marquis of Salisbury, cousin-once-removed-in-law of Smyth, and cousin-in-law of the Duncombes and <italic>Beckett</italic>. In 1873, the same trustees created <italic>American Investment Trust</italic> to invest in American railway securities. \nAt the same time, <italic>Scottish American Investment Trust</italic> formed, with trustees including Cashier of <italic>Royal Bank of Scotland</italic> James Fleming and representatives from <italic>British Linen Co</italic>, <italic>National Bank of Scotland</italic>, and <italic>Standard Life Assurance</italic>. Their success inspired the creation of other trusts, including <italic>Scottish American Investment</italic>, <italic>Scottish American Mortgage</italic>, and others in Dundee and Edinburgh. During the <italic>trusts</italic> boom Dundee specialized in America, Glasgow in South Africa, and Edinburgh in Australia, supplying a third of the latter\u2019s external capital.\nAmidst efforts to abolish the <italic>Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, & Abandoned Lands</italic> from 1870, operations continued, but shrank until Congress formally disbanded the agency, transferring all unfinished business to the office of the Assistant Adjutant General of the Army in 1872. But while America\u2019s oil monopoly allowed lower tariffs to raise oil exports for gold, Russia began ruinously competing for gold. As European markets collapsed, <italic>Cooke</italic> defaulted on her <italic>Northern Pacific</italic> RR collateralized loans in May. As depositors ran from <italic>Cooke</italic>\u2019s NBs, NYCH suspended over<italic>certification</italic>, shuttering NYSE. \nAs Cooke\u2019s son-in-law Charles Dennis Barney reorganized the failed <italic>Cooke</italic> into <italic>Barney</italic>, his extended cousin, Charles Tracy Barney\u2014the son of a banker and second cousin of John Morgan\u2019s Tracy wife\u2014married the sister of William Whitney, an extended cousin of John Morgan and his Tracy wife, who had married the daughter of a fellow descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, oil pioneer Oliver Payne, in 1869, before the latter merged his Cleveland oil refinery with Rockefeller to form <italic>OIL</italic> and became <italic>OIL</italic>\u2019s banker. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, <italic>COALA</italic> accumulated debt through <italic>Morgan</italic> to gain control of a third of Pennsylvania\u2019s anthracite coal. She also entered into a trust agreement with <italic>Morgan</italic>-financed <italic>PENN</italic> and competing transport railroads.\nWith Jay Cooke, so went his brother\u2019s <italic>Cooke</italic> DC branch, and <italic>First </italic>NB<italic> of</italic> <italic>DC, </italic>and<italic> Freedman Saving & Trust</italic>. After <italic>Freedman </italic>trustees appointed Frederick Douglass as bank president in 1874, he closed several branches and lent some of his own funds before asking Congress to abolish it. \nMeanwhile, Mississippi elected 32-year-old Blanche Bruce as the first Black elected to a full term in Senate by 1874. That year, he received a loan from <italic>Marine Bank</italic> of Georgia to buy a large plantation from a White landowner. While acquiring additional parcels and expanding the plantation over the next decade, Bruce\u2019s Black sharecroppers continued to live in poverty. Bruce played a key role in assembling a black political machine, leveraging the Black vote, and collaborating with White Republicans in Mississippi. <italic>Freedman </italic>closed in late June 1874 with 33 branches across 15 states. From 1876, Congress launched several investigations, with Blanche Bruce leading the Senate Committee, and finding improper loans and investments in real estate and stocks. \nLosing much of his wealth with <italic>Freedman</italic>\u2019s collapse, former slave Henry Harding recovered most of it through his hotel empire until a hurricane. Former <italic>Freedman</italic> Montgomery director, James Rapier remained in Congress through 1875, when he played a crucial role in passing the <italic>Civil Rights Act of 1875</italic>. Afterward, he founded more newspapers and received a patronage position as the collector of internal revenue for Alabama\u2019s Second District. Likewise, former <italic>Freedman</italic> Saint-Louis director James Thomas continued to build his vast property wealth but lost it all after a tornado at the end of the century.\nSenator Bruce continued to work with Frederick Douglass to provide opportunities for Blacks, but some Blacks accused them of betraying the community after Douglass married a White woman in 1884 with Bruce serving as witness. Bruce also shaped America\u2019s first Black dynasty. Blanche\u2019s only child, Roscoe, graduated from <italic>Phillips</italic> <italic>Exeter</italic> and <italic>Harvard</italic> before heading <italic>Tuskegee Institute</italic>\u2019s Education Department, Washington, DC\u2019s segregated school district, and Rockefeller\u2019s <italic>Dunbar Apartments</italic> in New York through a decade-long connection with the philanthropist.\nAs NYSE\u2019s suspension shocked MMSEC, railroad debt defaults grew. While his <italic>Erie</italic> RR failed, Gould gained control of UPR during the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>. Likewise, Alabama lost credit access, allowing <italic>Lehman</italic> to buy her bonds as they started a SB in Queens, New York. Creditors also ran from unincorporated banks organized as common law <italic>trusts</italic>. Only in  1882 did New York force <italic>trusts</italic> to incorporate as SBs. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, President Grant called for the repeal of BA1867 as it produced \u201c<italic>more evil than good at this time.</italic>\u201d  eliminated illiquidity triggers, tensed involuntary filings, eased voluntary discharges and majority compositions. Following the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Katz-descendant Hugo Finaly\u2014a Hungarian-born nephew of Horace Landau, a director of <italic>Morpurgo</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Black Sea agent after the <italic>Crimean War</italic>\u2014joined <italic>Paribas</italic> Amsterdam to examine American railroad securities.   \nTo protect UST debt, Chicago banker Lazarus Silverman advised Congress on a plan to issue bonds for resumption of specie payment. While silver inflation kept filings low, it deflated as Congress\u2019  of June 1875 committed to issue bonds to redeem notes in gold, end USLTN, and to raise tariffs without the other taxes. Within a month, <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic> voluntarily liquidated. The firm\u2019s counsel added that it was probably the first time that a large bank with access to capital on unsecured terms voluntarily liquidated. With silver deflation, <italic>Duncan Sherman</italic>\u2019s partners may have been spurred to file by BA1874\u2014including voluntarism and compositions. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1875</italic>, <italic>Duncan</italic>\u2019s creditors filed for an involuntary bankruptcy at the end of the year. Since Darius Ogden Mills had resigned from <italic>Bank of California</italic> in 1873, mismanagement combined with the new law may have destabilized silver. As Ralston\u2019s Comstock Lode mines failed to show dividends and his <italic>Bank of California</italic> failed, Ralston lost control and died from suspected suicide. While Seligman cousin-in-law Isaiah Hellman\u2019s <italic>Farmers & Merchants Bank</italic> suspended like all the regional banks, his grocery business continued to pay out all dues, allowing him to become one of the Pacific Coast\u2019s leading bankers. Although Nevada\u2019s Comstock Lode magnate John Mackay co-founded <italic>Bank of Nevada of San Francisco</italic>, Mills returned to reorganize <italic>Bank of California</italic>, and San Francisco\u2019s first bank clearing house organized soon after. \nSince Jacob Netter\u2019s sons apprenticed with <italic>Kuhn</italic> in New York, they opened a partnership by 1872. After Jacob died in 1875, his sons reorganized in <italic>Netter</italic> to invest in railroads and public utilities. By 1875, Abraham Kuhn\u2019s daughter wed a Katz-direct descendant direct of Court Jews\u2014including Lipman Cohen-Behrens, Johann Liebman, Joseph Goldschmid, Samson Wertheim, and Samuel Oppenheim\u2019s brother\u2014and so an extended cousin of Rothschild and K\u00f6nigswarter.\nBut Jews connected with the crisis-ridden Midwest particularly suffered after the <italic>Panic of 187</italic><italic>5</italic>. In 1877, failed petroleum investments<italic> </italic>forced <italic>Lichtenstein</italic> of New York to suffer losses, leading <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic> to write off her investment. As several of their partners failed, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s cousin-in-laws <italic>Netter</italic> of New York became bankrupt. That year, a daughter of Jacob Netter and Amalia Kuhn married a Seasongood of <italic>Heidelbach Seasongood</italic> and Cincinnati\u2019s leading private bank. After Philip Heidelbach\u2019s daughter married Speyer-grandson Isaac Ickelheimer, the family moved to New York and founded <italic>Heidelbach Ickelheimer</italic> stockbrokerage by 1879. While one <italic>Lichtenstein</italic> brother joined <italic>Ladenburg</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic> New York, the other joined <italic>Heidelbach</italic>.\nIn Chicago, among the <italic>Panic of 187</italic><italic>5 </italic>casualties, <italic>Illinois Trust & Savings Bank</italic> required investment from <italic>Armour</italic> and <italic>Marshall Field</italic> interests. As the co-founding Mitchell family took over leadership, they kinterlinked with Chauncey Blair by 1883. While Blair\u2019s ran<italic> Merchants</italic> NB, his uncle kinterlinked his brother with reaper innovator Cyrus McCormick\u2019s niece in 1882. \nIn New York John Thompson, having organized <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of New York </italic>in 1863, yielded control to <italic>Cooke</italic> interests in 1877, allowing Cashier George Baker, a descendant of Emperor Charlemagne, to take over operations. The same year, the Thompsons formed <italic>Chase</italic> NB, named in honor of President Lincoln\u2019s UST Secretary Salmon Chase. However, Thompson\u2019s Clark in-laws continued to lead <italic>First</italic> NB <italic>of Detroit</italic>.\nAlso, in the wake of the <italic>Panic of 187</italic><italic>5</italic><italic> </italic>in Chicago, Henry Greenbaum\u2019s <italic>German</italic> NB and <italic>German Savings Bank</italic> failed in 1877 due to large real estate investments in the Humboldt Park area. When the economy tightened, the banks could not convert these holdings into cash, forcing them to suspend operations. With liabilities over a million dollars, Greenbaum took personal responsibility and paid all depositors in full. Though his actions preserved his reputation, he lost his entire fortune and had to begin again. As a Greenbaum married a brother-in-law of Joseph Seligman\u2019s daughter, the cousinhood reorganized.\nHaving partnered with his father-in-law in <italic>Greenebaum Foreman</italic> in the 1860s, Gerhard Foreman established his own bank, <italic>Foreman</italic>. While Foreman\u2019s uncle\u2019s brothers-in-law, Sol Lewis co-founded and became the first president of the first bank in the Arizona Territory in 1877, and Meyer served as a director of <italic>Bank of California </italic>in San Francisco. As the railroad reached Yuma and the Tombstone discovery increased regional activity, Lewis and Prescott Kales, a Christian, opened <italic>Bank of Arizona</italic>. \nTwo years later, the Jacobs brothers opened <italic>Pima County Bank</italic>. Born in Britian to Polish parents, the Jacobs brothers moved to Baltimore in the 1840s, and California by 1851. Their sister married a descendant of <italic>Rothschild</italic> London cousin Levi Cohen-Barent\u2019s uncle in 1857. In 1867, the brothers moved to Tucson and opened <italic>Jacobs </italic>and added a money exchange in 1870. After founding <italic>Pima County Bank</italic>, they ran <italic>First </italic>NB <italic>of Tucson </italic>(1882\u20131885), <italic>Bank of Tucson </italic>(1885\u20131887), <italic>Consolidated Bank of Tucson </italic>(1887\u20131890), and <italic>Arizona </italic>NB (1890\u20131913), which Kales and Lewis formed out of <italic>Bank of Arizona</italic> in 1887.\nMoreover, the cousinhood also refocused from real estate to grain. Since Greenbaums founded New York bank and brokerage <italic>Greenbaum </italic>New York, their cousin Ernst Thalmann, whose father was a prominent Mannheim merchant, emigrated to America in 1867 and joined <italic>Greenbaum</italic> New York before he left to study finance in Europe. He soon returned and, in 1876, founded <italic>Limburger Thalmann </italic>a year after his sister married Brody-born Max Rappaport Rosentower in Berlin. Rosentower was a cousin-in-law of freight-forwarder <italic>Rozenthal</italic>, who parlayed his Galician and Warsaw banking connections to trade among Galicia, Russian Poland, and Germany.\nAs Adolf Ladenburg joined the partnership, they renamed <italic>Limburger Thalmann</italic> to <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic> from 1880. By then, the Ladenburg family of Mannheim linked to Anglo-German finance. In 1877, a <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Frankfurt heiress married <italic>Merton</italic> London banker William Merton, the son of Ralph Merton and Phillip Cohen-Barent. Since Ladenburg kinterlinked with Manchester cloth trader Jacob Behrens in 1844, their son wed a Warburg in 1879. That same year, their cousin of <italic>Ladenburg</italic> London married a Kaulla-in-law Eltzbacher of Amsterdam.\nAs <italic>Ladenburg</italic> Frankfurt heir Adolf started <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic> in New York, the firm<italic> </italic>acted as an agency for the Merton\u2019s <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic>, expanding from trading Harz lead into European metals, American copper, and Dutch Indies tin. <italic>Ladenburg</italic> became <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>\u2019s grain agent in London and New York from the 1880s. By 1884, Adolf Ladenburg married the daughter of New York banker Alex Stevens, a great-nephew of former <italic>Bank of Commerce</italic>\u2019s John Ledyard Stevens, descendant of former UST Secretary Albert Gallatin, and in-law of the Schermerhorn Astors and Heckschers, Hamburg relatives of <italic>Stiglitz</italic> and other<italic> </italic>bankers. \nAlex Stevens was President of <italic>Sixth</italic> NB <italic>of New York</italic> until her consolidation into <italic>Astor Trust</italic>, where he served as VP. His brother Byam began in the Cuba-New York sugar trade, joined <italic>Gold Board</italic>, held a seat on NYSE from 1869, and married an Astor. Their brother Frederic sat on <italic>Chemical</italic> NB\u2019s board from 1871. The connections with <italic>Stiglitz</italic> affiliated <italic>Mahs</italic> fostered the partnership of <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic> and <italic>Mahs</italic> cousins <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> to trade American securities with Europe from 1885. \nSince state bond financing limits from the panics of the 1840s, UST promoted investment by selling railroads and public lands. Municipalities attracted railroad bankers by issuing subsidy bonds and waiving rate controls. Landowner, merchant, and farmer coalitions invested to stimulate commerce and increase land values. Despite state attempts at regulation, municipal<italic> </italic>defaults grew. So, railroads charged less profitable localities higher rates. Since common law only protected individuals and corporations, localities lobbied legislatures. \nRHCs similarly increased rates on grain warehouses they operated. As New York banks accepted Chicago\u2019s grain elevator certificates, farmers lobbied for identical rates. Beginning with Illinois in 1871, Midwestern states enacted railroad rate caps. By 1877, the Court in  held that legislatures could alter grain elevators contract rates in the public interest. The decision set a public utilities precedent and spurred the Midwest, with Chicago leading. Chicago\u2019s warehouse notes grew into America\u2019s second largest money market, trailing only New York.\nBy 1869, Vanderbilt\u2019s consolidation halved New York to Chicago transit time. His insider information made Victoria Woodhull a rich broker. Claiming clairvoyance and royal blood, she unsuccessfully ran for president in 1872. Several years later, she married an heir of London bank <italic>Martin</italic>. Still, no woman was able to follow Woodhull to own or head a NYSE brokerage until the 1950s. \nMeanwhile, the most prominent married woman to do so since Esther Liebman in the 17th century, Court Jewess Clara Bischoffsheim Hirsch banked industry in Britain and Europe. While Clara lived in London, women in her father\u2019s homeland, Mainz, hid in bank back offices to protect firm reputations. The same year as the <italic>Uni of Pennsylvania</italic> became coeducational and one of the earliest universities admit female undergraduate students, <italic>Harvard</italic> remained men-only and formed <italic>Radcliffe</italic> <italic>College</italic> to parallel cater to women in 1879.\nLabor and race also changed. Studying unions since 1867, Parliament replaced the <italic>Master & Servant Act </italic>with the<italic> Employers & Workmen Act of 1875.</italic><italic> </italic>But while<italic> </italic>European manors remained large, American free Blacks subdivided plots. As states adopted poor laws, courts applied them only to Blacks, and so Black prisoners powered Southern collieries and roads instead of taxes. Although the <italic>Civil Rights Act of 1875 </italic>banned states from racial segregation in public spaces and transportation., the Court struck down <italic>Civil Rights</italic> to fight state protectionism. \nThe year before her law of 1888, Mississippi saw the birth of a segregate town. After future Confederacy President Jefferson Davis\u2019 older brother created a Black cooperative community in the 1820s, his slaves Benjamin Montgomery and his sons Isaiah and Thornton of managed a dry goods store at Davis Bend, Mississippi, from the 1840s. Amidst growing segregation and racial discrimination, Isaiah co-founded Mound Bayou as an all-Black town in 1887. Mound Bayou served as a haven and a symbol of Black self-sufficiency and economic empowerment. The colony\u2019s government and economy remained under Black control.\nWhile railroads sought to protect middle-class women from the \u2018indelicacies\u2019 of sharing transportation with male riders, regardless of their race, the criteria for segregating passengers shifted from gender and class to race. As Mississippi ordered railroad segregation in 1888, the Court condoned it in 1896, and states codified it. Meanwhile, marriages continued linking bank and railroad wealth. By 1878, the son of <italic>Delaware & Hudson</italic> RR President James Roosevelt married Helen Schermerhorn Astor, an extended cousin of the Rockefellers. Twenty years later, Helen\u2019s cousin John Astor became the inaugural depositor at the newly opened <italic>Astor</italic> NB, which prioritized serving female customers with separate elaborate rooms.\nAs an Astor married his sister in 1878, James Paul married Anthony Drexel\u2019s daughter and became a partner of <italic>Morgan</italic> <italic>Drexel</italic>. Preferring pre-Revolutionary Protestant British immigrants, <italic>Morgan</italic> did not share kinship or partnerships with any Jewish bank until the 1930s, and then only via Protestants, without hiring Jews for decades. Likewise, <italic>Morgan</italic> focused on railroad and sovereign debt. As Joseph Drexel retired in 1876, John Morgan hired his father\u2019s friend, Egisto Fabbri, from a Catholic family like Drexel. \nBorn in Florence to a local father and Russian or Armenian mother, Fabbri immigrated to America, converted to Anglicanism, and married a Brit by the 1850s. Partnering with Frederick Chauncey, an in-law of <italic>Peabody</italic> affiliate <italic>Wetmore Cryder</italic>, and forming forwarding agent and shipper <italic>Fabbri Chauncey</italic>. From 1876, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s partners split New York profits between Morgan, Fabbri, and the Philadelphia partners\u2014Anthony Drexel, his brother Francis, and James Wright, who had joined  <italic>Drexel</italic><italic> </italic>in 1861\u2014at 42.5, 20, and 37.5%. \nFrom 1877, after <italic>Morgan</italic> admitted Fabbri, no new partners were added in the New York office, leaving Morgan, Fabbri, and Wright as the only resident partners. In 1883, Charles Godfrey, a partner in Philadelphia since 1875, moved to New York. That same month, the Philadelphia office admitted three partners: Drexel\u2019s son-in-law James Paul; George Thomas, who had begun as Jay Cooke\u2019s secretary in 1866; and Edward Stotesbury, the son of a Philadelphia sugar refiner who joined <italic>Drexel</italic> in 1866 as an office boy. Philadelphia then had five members, including Francis Drexel, who was not active. After Francis died in 1885, the number of partners in Philadelphia returned to four, where it remained for the rest of the decade.\nBy 1878, Fabbri persuaded <italic>Morgan</italic> to back Thomas Edison in developing electricity with <italic>Western Union</italic>. <italic>Morgan</italic> later handled <italic>Edison</italic>\u2019s British electric light patents and served as his European agent, leaving <italic>Edison</italic> Italy to <italic>Fabbri Chauncey</italic>. As Fabbri was a director of <italic>Panama</italic> RR, that railroad sold her canal interest to French <italic>Lesseps</italic> to form <italic>Panama Canal Co </italic>in 1880. Since constructing <italic>Suez Canal</italic>, Ferdinand Lesseps initiated <italic>Panama Canal</italic> in the late 1870s with <italic>Reinach</italic> financing. \nAfter negotiating exclusive rights to construct the canal from Colombia, Lesseps countered America\u2019s <italic>Monroe Doctrine</italic> concerns by forming syndicates to create the impression of widespread American involvement. While only <italic>Seligman</italic> London sold subscriptions in Britain,<italic> Seligman</italic> New York, <italic>Morgan</italic>, and <italic>Winslow Lanier</italic> did so in America, and <italic>Seligman</italic> Paris, <italic>Comptoir</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, SG <italic>Belge</italic>, <italic>Caisse d</italic><italic>\u2019</italic><italic>Escompte</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, <italic>Lyonnais</italic>, and others were agents in France.\nSince the 1840s, <italic>Blake</italic>,<italic> </italic>serving as <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s American securities agent out of Boston, kinterlinked through Quaker SBUS banker Jacob Barker with Joseph Wharton, whose Quaker grandfather had married Abraham Redwood\u2019s granddaughter, a <italic>Hottinguer</italic> and <italic>Baring </italic>cousin, great-granduncle wed a <italic>Lloyd</italic> cousin. To head the London branch after 1874, <italic>Blake</italic> hired Emil Heinemann, a former New York merchant descended from an ennobled Germano-Dutch family, and a son-in-law of Henry Dabney, John Morgan\u2019s former partner. \nLikewise, Wharton Barker of Philadelphia\u2014grandson of Jacob Barker, nephew of Joseph Wharton, third great-grandson of Abraham Redwood, and cousin-in-law of Anthony Drexel\u2014became the financial agent for Russia in Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition and for four merchant cruisers in 1878. While Barker proposed major industrial projects in Russian Ukraine, including coal and iron developments, but his plans were delayed and ultimately rejected by Tsar Alex III.\nWhile some trusts failed after the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, <italic>Scottish American Investment Trust </italic>and others continued to grow, hiring <italic>Kendy</italic>\u2014led by fellow Scot John Kendy after he resigned from <italic>Jesup</italic>\u2014as the New York agent to channel Scottish investments into American ventures and engaging in reorgs. By 1879, Kendy hired his Glasgow-born nephew, John Kendy Tod. After Tod married a great-granddaughter of Alex Brown in 1882, took over <italic>Kendy</italic> after John retired. \nKendy\u2019s most notable relationship started in 1877, when he James Hill\u2014born in Ontario to Irish parents\u2014in New York, soon acting as his banker and financial adviser in his efforts, alongside <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic>\u2019s George Stephen, to acquire the bankrupt <italic>Saint-Paul & Pacific</italic> RR, which was soon renamed <italic>Saint-Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba</italic> RR. In 1880, Queen Victoria established <italic>Canadian Pacific</italic> RR through an agreement with a syndicate that included Hill,<italic> Kendy</italic>, <italic>Bank of Montreal</italic>, and Pascoe Grenfell, a partner in <italic>Morton</italic> <italic>Rose</italic>, who represented <italic>Kohn</italic> <italic>Reinach</italic> of Paris. Through the 1880s, Kendy secured finance to expand <italic>Manitoba</italic> RR, including a bond issue in 1886, negotiating with <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Jacob Schiff and <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s Thomas Baring for investment from <italic>Brown</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, and John Astor.\nWithout Kendy, Morris Jesup formed <italic>Jesup Paton</italic> with John Paton. Born in Scotland to Reverend John Paton, Paton worked for a Liverpool merchant firm involved in American trade and with <italic>Bank of British North America</italic> in London and Kingston, Canada. By 1879, <italic>Jesup Paton</italic> hired Jesup\u2019s nephew, Cornelius Ledyard Cuyler, who became a partner in 1882. After Jesup retired in 1884, the firm became <italic>Paton</italic>. As Paton retired in 1892, Culyter partnered with Junius Morgan to form <italic>Cuyler Morgan</italic>. A nephew of John Morgan, Junius graduated <italic>Princeton</italic> in 1888 and married Josephine Adams Perry, a Boston Brahmin descendant of Commodore Perry\u2019s brother and second cousin of <italic>Rothschild</italic> affiliate August Belmont II.\n<italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of Asian & South American Colonization</italic>\nAs China limited foreign trade to designated \u2018security merchants\u2019 after 1745, the thirteen leading hong merchants in Canton evolved into merchant-bureaucrats in 1755. While the <italic>Puankhequa</italic> hong dynasty continued, there were only eight hongs by 1780 due to failures and fierce competition among merchants. Hongs also acted as bankers (\u201c<italic>qianzhuang</italic>\u201d) to extend credit to buyers. Among the recruited merchants, <italic>Howqua</italic> and several others joined. These merchant-bureaucrats regulated trade and handled relations with foreigners. The trade restrictions to ensure viable trading partners and prevent financial panics. \n<italic>Puankhequa</italic>\u2019s one-time cashier, Wu Guoying traded since 1768. The Wu family long resided in the principal Fujian black tea district. Before China\u2019s ports closed, one Wu ancestor a hong merchant of the Port of Amoy. Guoying began trading with foreigners as <italic>Howqua</italic> out of Canton after 1777. So did Guoying\u2019s son Bingjian. <italic>Puankhequa</italic>\u2019s cousin Pan Zhangyao (\u201cConsequa\u201d) established as a trader in Canton outside of the hong monopoly. Arrested in 1796 for unauthorized trade, Pan was forced to become a hong, and engaged in substantial trade with EIC. \nBritish bankers had the support of EIC. Since <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s William Mills became a director of EIC in the 1770s, he yielded that position in 1785 to his brother Charles, who became Deputy Chair in 1801. Banker Robert Drummond\u2019s nephew was EIC\u2019s senior member in Canton between 1792 and 1807. However, as Consequa\u2019s sought to resolve credit issues with American <italic>Girard</italic>, he enlisted merchants like <italic>Astor</italic> to recover debts. \nWhile Western <italic>merchant bankers</italic> extended trade credit, <italic>qianzhuang</italic> led Westerners to become <italic>merchant lawyers</italic>. Initial dispute resolutions often involved mediation by cousin lawyers. Examples include Reverend Forbes\u2019 son John, who shifted from law to trade in 1794, and John Cushing\u2014a son of a Far East trader and descendant of Reverend John Cotton\u2014who negotiated America\u2019s inaugural treaty with China. \nAlong with Samuel Rawle of Philadelphia, China traders Benjamin Wilcocks, George Russell, and James Ames of Boston had legal ties. Lawyers boomed along with the trade expansion. Similarly, John Forbes\u2019 brother wed the sister of Boston Brahmin Thomas-Handasyd Perkins, of <italic>Perkins</italic> trading who led FBUS <italic>Boston</italic> (until yielding to George Cabot to focus on commerce and politics.)\nHowever, Consequa\u2019s decline began in 1807 when he handed overdue American notes to Wilcocks for collection. As President Jefferson signed the <italic>Embargo Act</italic> in 1808, Dunant the Gilpin attached Consequa\u2019s assets in Philadelphia over poor quality tea claims until 1809. Despite debt collection litigation, Wilcocks and Charles Jared Ingersoll failed through 1811, EIC\u2019s debts to Consequa\u2019 grew. After Consequa died in 1823, his family resigned from the hong trade, but his former cashier, <italic>Howqua</italic> soon became head hong.\nSince Thomas Coutts\u2019 in-law Frederick North became Governor of Ceylon, Coutts recommended Robert Arbuthnot, whose family they saved in the <italic>Panic of 1772</italic>, to become North\u2019s Chief Secretary in 1801. That year George Arbuthnot sought to profit from importing gold from India to Ceylon. In 1801 Coutts recommended him to Francis Lautour in Madras. Lautour, an Alsatian merchant who moved to Britain in the 1730s, married an Englishwoman, and founded <italic>Lautour</italic> in Madras 1777, took Arbuthnot into partnership, and later became <italic>Arbuthnot</italic><italic> </italic>as the new partner gained repute and Britain displaced the French.\nLikewise, the French <italic>Indes</italic> made advances in Asia. In the early 17th century, Portuguese mercenary Philip Brito controlled Burmese Syriam until 1612, when the King of Upper Burma executed Brito and enslaved his men, ending Portuguese power. EIC and Dutch traded there intermittently until regional wars forced withdrawal. EIC and the French returned by 1700 for teak, though ongoing local warfare continued to disrupt trade.\nFrench interest in Vietnam began in 1721 when engineer Reynault, aboard the frigate Dana\u00e9, explored Pulo Condore but recommended abandoning it after a year. The French then turned their attention to the mainland, with Jacques O\u2019Friell, an Irishman in French service, visiting Annam in 1743 and securing promising trade prospects with the help of Catholic missionaries. Within two years, O\u2019Friell married the niece of the Governor of French India, who assessed commercial opportunities, and promoted the establishment a trading factory on Callao Island near Fai-fo, strategically located for trade with Southeast Asia and China. \nBy the late 18th century, French support was crucial in Nguyen Anh\u2019s struggle against the Tay-son rebels. French officers, including Olivier Puymanel, helped modernize Nguyen Anh\u2019s military and fortifications. Jean Baptiste Chaigneau and others commanded Nguyen Anh\u2019s navy and played key roles in battles, leading to the unification of Vietnam in 1802. While Napoleon did not focus on Vietnam, merchants built links. \nTaking the name Nguyen Van Thang, Chaigneau married a Vietnamese Catholic woman, and their son, Nguyen Van Duc (Michel Dirc Chaigneau), mediated Phan Thanh Gian\u2019s 1863 embassy to Paris. Ba La Di (Laurent Barizy) also married a Vietnamese Catholic, and their daughter later became Nguyen Van Thang\u2019s second wife. Nguyen Van Chan (Vannier) married Magdaleine Sen from Phu Cam in 1811. Nguyen Van Duc and his remaining family integrated into French society, becoming a French Ministry of Finances commissioner.\nLikewise, Catholic French merchants expanded at Asia\u2019s other end, in the Ottoman Empire. French bankers became influential in the Ottoman Empire, particularly in Constantinople\u2019s Galata and Pera, following the renegotiation of Capitulations in 1740. This agreement allowed French merchants to operate with enhanced privileges. Joseph Crespin arrived in Galata in 1788 and established a brokerage. In 1792, he merged his business with Giorgio Lorando, a Venetian merchant, forming a significant financial partnership. Their families intermarried with the Levantine Catholic Glavany family, strengthening their economic influence. By the early 19th century, the Crespin and Lorando families managed loans and tax farming for the Ottomans.\nSimilarly, the Abbotts connected the Ottoman Empire to Britain. In the 1780s, Bartholomew Abbott and his stepson established <italic>Abbott</italic> in Salonica, partnering with Greek merchants. Abbott imported violet wood, textiles, cotton yarn from <italic>Lee Brant</italic> of London, and sugar from <italic>Roux</italic>, exporting tobacco, sponges, and grains. He collaborated with <italic>Fletcher</italic> and <italic>Gout</italic> in Malta. \nAs member of <italic>Levant Co</italic>, he served as Proconsul in Salonica and Vice-Consul for Sweden, Denmark, and Venice. Robert Abbott managed trade in Aleppo until his death in 1797, when his wife, Luisa Vernon, took over his business and consular duties. She oversaw <italic>Levant</italic> and EIC affairs, forwarded correspondence, and collaborated with <italic>Rousseau</italic> in Baghdad. Her activities ended in 1799 when John Barker was appointed to settle Robert Abbott\u2019s estate, but she continued trading independently.\nFollowing the defeat of Napoleon, EIC vanquished the French from the former Dutch Indies strategic port in 1811 to establish the British port and base of Singapore in 1819. During their expansion in India, EIC recruited low Dalit castes traditionally denied service, including the Mahar, Dusads of Bihar, and Pariahs of Madras, into the Bombay Army. While Brahmins banked the Hindu Maratha Empire, EIC defeated the Maratha in 1818 and refused to honor debts owed to local bankers, resulting in widespread insolvency as EIC annexed the lands for the British Empire.\nAs EIC monopolized the China trade and barred private merchants, Scottish free traders established agents in Canton to compete with EIC. And as direct trade with India opened for Americans after the <italic>Revolution</italic>, <italic>Perkins</italic> became the price leader for American opium merchants, including <italic>Astor</italic>, <italic>Girard</italic>, and <italic>Wilcocks Latimer</italic>, the latter associated with America\u2019s Consul at Canton. \nLed by in-law John Perkins Cushing\u2014whose fifth great-aunt had married Elder John Strong and widowed Chief Justice great-grandfather had married a descendant of Reverend John Cotton\u2014<italic>Perkins</italic> used EIC\u2019s restrictions to monopolize the drug trade with of head hong <italic>Howqua</italic>. After 1821, the hong ousted other merchants. After John Forbes, a cousin of <italic>Perkins</italic>\u2019 Cushing, married a Russell cousin, he joined <italic>Russell</italic>, and together with <italic>Perkins</italic> undermined EIC\u2019s China trade monopoly by closely associating with <italic>Howqua</italic>.\nAnd as Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, fostering trade, control of the Philippines moved from the Mexican Viceroy to Madrid. The decline of the galleon trade and the dissolution of <italic>Royal Philippine Co</italic> shifted the Philippines to an agricultural export economy, focusing on products like sugar, abaca (for cordage fiber), tobacco, and coffee. By 1823, a special tax on Chinese merchants led over 800 to return China afterward, a thousand more sought refuge in the mountains as 453 were imprisoned. \nOne of the fortunate was Basilio, a Chinese mestizo timber merchant in Iloilo. After his Spanish master Lopez adopted him and left a large inheritance in the 1830s, Basilio joined the principalia class from 1842. While Basilio was one of the first to acquire haciendas, his many children were active in commerce, lending, and acquiring land in Panay and the frontier of Negros across the Guimaras Straits from Iloilo.\nFor the same reasons, Britons entered Chile and Peru. Jorge Edwards, the son of Lord Hugo Mostyn, Baron Vaux, and Isabel O\u2019Higgins, studied medicine in Eton and became a doctor from the Royal College of Physicists in London. He married a famous beauty, giving up his surnames for her, adopting the common ones, Edwards. He later married Isabel Ossandon Iribarren and had many children in Chile. Since in Chile in 1807, he engaged in mining while working as a surgeon and serving in the liberation army. By 1818, Edwards became a Chilean citizen and served as the country\u2019s first senator.\nWhile Exeter wool merchant Antony Gibbs married into the landed gentry, his elder brother Vicary Gibbs became a judge, and his brother George became a merchant in Bristol and married the daughter of the Rector of Stowe-nine-Churches, Northamptonshire. After failing in 1789, Antony moved to Spain, where he traded English cloth for wine and fruit. After the Spanish lost control of the Pacific in 1819, the government in Lima allowed the first export of bullion in foreign ships for revenue. \nOne of the earliest foreign businesses, <italic>Gibbs</italic> opened in newly independent Lima by 1822. But the firm remained unremarkable as a commission house consigning British textiles. While <italic>Gibbs</italic> was a merchant, Hannover-born Frederick Huth established <italic>Huth</italic> in London in 1809 after apprenticing with <italic>Brentano Urbieta</italic>, Basque merchants of Hamburg. The first merchant bank to branch to Lima and Valpara\u00edso by the 1820s, <italic>Huth</italic> ranked just below <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London.\nIn British India, <italic>Alexander</italic> was Calcutta\u2019s first agency house. Following India\u2019s famine in the 1770s, <italic>Alexander</italic> established <italic>Bank of Hindustan</italic>. As Britain battled the French and Dutch in the <italic>American Revolution</italic>, French private traders and <italic>Dutch East Indies Co </italic>remained the most important channels for Indian remittance. \nBy 1782, EIC prohibited employees from monetary transactions with non-British European nationals, leading to a surge in free merchant activity in Calcutta. Closely associated with London bankers and senior EIC military officials, John Palmer formed <italic>Palmer</italic> and later founded <italic>Calcutta Bank</italic>. Other agency houses included <italic>Cruttenden</italic> and <italic>Mackintosh</italic>, which founded <italic>Commercial Bank</italic>. To fund continuing warfare in India, EIC established <italic>Bank of Bengal</italic> in 1806 on the BOE model for short-term credit. \nDuring the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, EIC issued the first \u2018free\u2019 licenses to export teas from Canton, spurring traders from 1801. After Prussian Vice-Consul Charles Magniac\u2014the son of a Huguenot goldsmith of London who made timepieces for the Chinese market\u2014arrived in Canton in 1802, he joined consuls from Austrian and Prussian in a trade firm that became known as <italic>Magniac</italic>. Around the same time, Scot William Jardine joined EIC as a ship\u2019s surgeon. After EIC allowed Scot trader<italic> Mackintosh</italic>\u2019s nephew, James Matheson, a descendant of the Scot Lord of Lovat, to go to India in 1815, Jardine left EIC and set up a venture with Parsee Framjee Cowasjee in 1817. By 1820, Matheson became Danish Consul in Canton and partnered with Basque <italic>Yrissari</italic>.<italic> </italic>\nBritish merchant bankers affiliated with the West Indies sought to link with the newly free East Indies trade. While <italic>Baring</italic> established a Canton agency house in 1807, EIC prohibited her employees from being opium agents in 1809. So, <italic>Baring</italic> invited SW Davidson, a Scottish native and naturalized Portuguese subject, as their opium commissions partner. After leaving Canton in the 1820s, Davidson hired <italic>Cambridge</italic>-educated Thomas Dent. While Dent\u2019s grandfather Robert Dent was a <italic>Child</italic> partner from 1763, his second cousin once removed and cousin-in-law John Dent become a <italic>Child</italic> partner from 1795.\nAs Thomas Dent became the senior partner, he named the firm <italic>Dent</italic> in 1824, and acted as the Sardinian consul. When his younger brother took over operations, Dent left Canton for London to join <italic>Mackintosh</italic>\u2019s London affiliate while <italic>Dent</italic> remained <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s Canton agent. With wealth from trading transatlantic corn and tobacco trade their West Indies sugar plantations, the Gladstones partnered with cousin-in-law Gillanders and Ogilvy to form <italic>Gladstone Gillanders Ogilvy</italic> in Calcutta by 1825. <italic>Coutts</italic>-affiliated <italic>Arbuthnot</italic> traded in commodities, accepted bills of exchange, and extended credit for commission and interest and a son of former partner Joseph LaTour kinterlinked with <italic>Barclay</italic>.\nAnd while his former brother-in-law Oswald Manning led West Indies trader <italic>Manning</italic>, John Smyth of <italic>Smyth</italic> became a Partner of <italic>Magniac </italic><italic>Smyth</italic>. In 1824, Charles Magniac\u2019s brother father a child with a Chinese woman below his station and resigned resignation from <italic>Magniac </italic><italic>Smyth</italic>. While he considered returning alone to Canton, but opposition from his brother and William Jardine prevented this. Since Charles Magniac and his partners resigned by 1825, Jardine became a partner in <italic>Magniac </italic><italic>Smyth</italic>. And as Yrissari died the following year, <italic>Mackintosh</italic>\u2019s nephew James Matheson wound down <italic>Yrissari </italic>and appointed <italic>Magniac </italic><italic>Smyth</italic> as his agent in Canton. Following a glut of cotton and opium in 1829, <italic>Magniac </italic><italic>Smyth</italic> and <italic>Dent</italic> monopolized the Indian trade with <italic>Jejeebhoy</italic> and his Indian partners. \nEuropean merchants cosigned opium and other crops from <italic>Jejeebhoy</italic>. Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy, a prominent Parsee merchant of Western India, rose to prominence in the late 18th century. Initially hindered by EIC\u2019s trade monopoly in China, Jejeebhoy and other Parsee merchants like the priestly caste Beramji Bharda of Gujarat established their own ventures, notably in the opium trade. With a network of co-religionists and other traders, Jejeebhoy connected Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, and Canton. In 1814, he founded his merchant fleet and established <italic>Jejeebhoy</italic>, and associated with fellow Near East Parsee as well as Hindu partners. \nWhile the Parsee, Marwari, and Gujarati had been involved trade networks across the Indian Ocean and beyond for centuries, the Chettiar community in South India became prominent in finance and trade as British colonialism expanded to Ceylon. While Chettiars used a double-entry accounting system and conducted interbank accounting among themselves, they settled in cash with outsiders. Until the introduction of Western banking in the 1840s, Chettiars dominated Ceylon\u2019s money exchange and trade and plantation credit. \nAs colonialism progressed, Britain outlawed the Hindu promotion of widow suicide in 1829. Britain also offered opportunities for ostracized Hindus. In 1829, <italic>Palmer</italic> and <italic>Mackintosh</italic> fused <italic>Calcutta Bank</italic> and <italic>Commercial Bank</italic> into <italic>Union Bank</italic> with the support of many business leaders of Calcutta, including Dwarkanath Tagore. Since the Brahmin landlord Tagore family settled in Bengal in the late 18th century, they were ostracized for collected taxes for the Muslim rulers. Isolated from other Brahmins, the family served the Europeans as compradors. Along with wealth, the family accessed European education and British Colonial Service appointments. Likely from the high clerical Kayastha caste, Rajkissore Dutt established <italic>Bank of India</italic>.\nWith Indian commodity prices deflating in Britain, <italic>Palmer</italic>\u2019s London affiliate demanded full repayment. Unable to do so,<italic> Palmer</italic> defaulted, triggering the <italic>Panic of 1829</italic>, and felling <italic>Alexander</italic>, <italic>Mackintosh</italic>, <italic>Union Bank,</italic> <italic>Bank of Hindustan</italic>, and others. As Rajkissore Dutt forged checks, he was imprisoned, and his <italic>Bank of India </italic>failed.\n Notably, the EIC-affiliated <italic>Bank of Bengal</italic> survived. After the fall of Bengal\u2019s agency houses, Dwarkanath Tagore partnered with Briton William Carr to form <italic>Carr Tagor</italic> in the 1830s, soon promoting <italic>Raniganj Colliery</italic>, <italic>Calcutta Steam Tug Association</italic>, <italic>Bengal Salt</italic>, <italic>Begnal</italic> <italic>Coal</italic>, <italic>Steam Ferry Bridge</italic>, <italic>India Shipping</italic>, and other joint stocks. Likewise,<italic> Carr Tagore</italic> fused several yards into <italic>Calcutta Docking</italic> with Rustomjee Cowasjee. Of a prominent Bombay Parsee mercantile family, <italic>Cowasjee</italic> soon established in Canton. \nAs Parliament ended EIC\u2019s China trade monopoly in 1833, <italic>Magniac </italic><italic>Smyth</italic> rushed into the tea trade. While <italic>Gladstone</italic> <italic>Gillanders</italic> <italic>Ogilvy</italic>\u2019s affiliate, <italic>Gillanders Arbuthnot</italic>, became Bengal\u2019s main agency ho While <italic>Gladstone</italic> <italic>Gillanders</italic> <italic>Ogilvy</italic> partnered with <italic>Arbuthnot</italic><italic> </italic>to form <italic>Gillanders</italic> <italic>Arbuthnot</italic> in Calcutta<italic> </italic>and became Bengal\u2019s main agency house, John Palmer refocused from India to China and partnered with <italic>Dent</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s Canton agent. The same year, a nephew of the wife of Dent\u2019s second cousin once removed and cousin-in-law, deceased <italic>Child</italic> partner John Dent, married a Smyth. By 1835, India\u2019s first savings bank formed with Jejeebhoy as a director, mercantile firms opposed calls from Bombay businessmen for a joint stock bank in 1836.\nBy 1838, <italic>Magniac Smyth</italic> became <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Canton agent. Finding hong terms unprofitable, <italic>Magniac</italic> smuggled Calcutta opium into China. As China seized the opium, <italic>Magniac Smyth</italic><italic>\u2019</italic>s Smyth persuaded Parliament to intervene for free trade in the <italic>Opium War</italic> until the <italic>Treaty of Nanking</italic> awarded reparations, opened Shanghai and three ports, and ceded Hong Kong to Britain, where <italic>Magniac</italic> moved her main office. As bankers multiplied in Shanghai with the treaty,<italic> Rothschild</italic> added Quaker <italic>Lloyd</italic> cousins <italic>Bower Hanbury</italic> as Shanghai agents. \nSince Boston\u2019s Joshua Bates wed Russell Sturgis\u2019 cousin, he founded <italic>Baring</italic> Boston in 1826, and <italic>Baring</italic> became <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s London agent by 1832. Out of Massachusetts, Augustine Heard joined <italic>Russell</italic> by 1830<italic>.</italic> His father John invested in New England pirates\u2014commissioned by the Continental Congress during the <italic>Revolution</italic>\u2014, which he expanded into the China trade. After John Heard\u2019s first wife\u2019s nephew, Joseph Story, became Court Justice from 1811, Augustine co-founded <italic>Suffolk Bank</italic> in 1818. But as <italic>Wilcocks Latimer</italic> controlled two-thirds of Turkish opium in Canton, <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s Heard hired Joseph Coolidge\u2014a Boston Brahmin <italic>Harvard</italic> graduate who married the granddaughter of Thomas Jefferson\u2014and promoted John Forbes to partner as he gained Wu\u2019s trust. \nSimilarly, <italic>Sassoon</italic> began trading with China. Since Ottoman Court Jew David Sassoon fled persecution in Baghdad with his family in 1836, he established <italic>Sassoon</italic> to manufacture textiles in India. Remaining in Ottoman Izmir, Sassoon\u2019s cousin-in-laws Haim Gubbay collaborated with Bochor Taranto, who later dominated high quality Turkish opium, which reached China and other markets, despite British attempts to monopolize the trade. Nearby Singapore became a hub for Chinese labor and Southeast Asian capital.\nSince the British attack on Canton from 1839 caused significant losses for <italic>Howqua</italic> and Augustine Heard and Coolidge left <italic>Russell</italic> to found rival <italic>Heard</italic> by 1840. While China\u2019s Emperor refused Wu\u2019s request to retire as head hong, the <italic>Treaty of Nanking</italic> dissolved the hong in 1842, when Wu sent his surplus capital for <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s John Forbes to invest in American enterprises. After Wu died in 1843, Forbes continued to manage the funds for Wu\u2019s heir and became closely identified with <italic>Chicago</italic>, <italic>Burlington & Quincy </italic>RR for over half a century. \nFollowing more liberalized trade terms, Forbes competed more fiercely<italic> </italic>with<italic> Heard </italic>and <italic>Russell</italic>, the latter promoting <italic>COALB</italic>\u2019s Huguenot descendant Bostonian Warren Delano\u2014who had married of Catherine Lyman, whose father was a Boston Brahmin Judge and a cousin once removed Juliet Pierpont married Junius Morgan\u2014before kinterlinking with Forbes in the 1860s.\nIn 1841, <italic>Rathbone Benson</italic> became the Liverpool agent for EIC and began operations in India, soon opening branches in Shanghai and Canton. After Samuel Gair\u2014<italic>Baring</italic> Liverpool\u2019s American-born Partner\u2014secured an apprenticeship for cotton trader <italic>Rathbone</italic>\u2019s William Rathbone VI at <italic>Baring</italic> London, Rathbone married Gair\u2019s daughter in 1847 and retained Gair\u2019s son to open <italic>Rathbone </italic>New York. \nAround the same time, <italic>Baring</italic> merged with <italic>Finlay</italic>. Founded in Glasgow in 1745, <italic>Finlay</italic> initially traded cotton and expanded into Asia and South America before transitioning to tea and kinterlinking with extended <italic>Coutts</italic>-cousin <italic>Campbell</italic> in the 1840s. By then, James Coutts\u2019 first cousin twice removed Reverend John Horner married Abel Smyth\u2019s great-granddaughter. \nWhile William Campbell was involved in West Indies trade, Finlay-in-law James Campbell and his nephews founded <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> in Bombay with Charles Perkins Forbes, a nephew of Thomas-Handasyd Perkins and an extended cousin of <italic>Coutts</italic>\u2019 William Forbes of Monymusk and <italic>Russell</italic>\u2019s John Forbes. The former became a major Bombay trading house and had good relations with Jejeebhoy and <italic>Magniac Smyth</italic>. Other Scots refocused from the Americas, such as the Virginia trading <italic>Findlay</italic> of Glasgow, moving to Burma in 1839.\nIn Bombay, Parsees diverged from forming JVs with Europeans, unlike their counterparts in Calcutta. Since India\u2019s first savings bank formed in 1835 with Jejeebhoy as a director, mercantile firms opposed calls from Bombay businessmen for a joint stock bank in 1836. By 1840, Framjee Cowasjee helped form the city\u2019s first modern bank, <italic>Bank of Bombay</italic>, of which Jejeebhoy soon became the sole Indian director. \nAs Jejeebhoy received a hereditary baronetcy in 1842, Cowasjee joined Dadabhai Wadia and Jijibhai Dadabhai to promote <italic>Bank of Western India</italic>. Remaining under British control, this venture was renamed <italic>Oriental Bank </italic>and moved to London. Conversely, Parsees had better representation in the unchartered <italic>Commercial Bank of India</italic> of 1845, where five of nine principal promoters were Parsees, including Cursetjee Cowasjee and Cowasjee Davar. However, efforts to industrialize India with mines and railroads did not take off.\nWith a virtual credit monopoly in Ceylon since the 1820s, Chettiars began lose it as <italic>Bank of Ceylon</italic> established in 1841 to foster cultivation. From that year, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London invested in Ceylonese tea plantations via their Katz-d\u2019Worms in-laws. By 1846, <italic>Oriental Bank </italic>established Singapore\u2019s first bank. After buying the failed <italic>Bank of Ceylon\u2019s</italic> monopoly in 1847, <italic>Oriental Bank</italic>, became the first British exchange bank chartered for India and the East, overcoming EIC\u2019s opposition. Amidst the start of the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, <italic>Magniac Smyth</italic>\u2019s Alex Jardine became concerned with his partner John Smyth policies and joined his cousin to start his own firm, <italic>Jardine Matheson</italic> (\u201c<italic>Jardine</italic>\u201d).\nWilliam Wallace liked Burma to India and Britain. In 1841, a son of  a director of <italic>National Bank of Scotland</italic>, Wallace joined <italic>Frith</italic> of Bombay. Parsee Framjee Patel\u2014whose surname originates from the title of mayor of Bombay granted to his family in 1692\u2014had been a partner since 1827. In 1844, Patel co-founded <italic>Frith</italic> <italic>Wallace</italic> with Wallace, who returned to London. In 1848, his brother Lewis joined <italic>Frith</italic> in Bombay, which reformed as <italic>Wallace</italic>. In 1853, William established timber merchant and shipbuilder<italic> Wallace</italic> in Burma, which also shipped tea to Bombay. While William bought teak for Indian railways by 1857, Patel retired from Wallace and established <italic>Framjee</italic> <italic>Sands</italic> in 1859 with his sons and British partners. \nWith <italic>Oriental Bank</italic>\u2019s arrival, the Chetti bankers lost their exchange business, becoming intermediaries between <italic>Oriental Bank</italic> and native Ceylonese borrowers, facilitating economic development. Additionally, the Chettiars played a significant role in financing the development of rice cultivation in Burma after 1852, contributing to the region\u2019s economic growth.\nWhile the Muslim sultans of Brunei presided over a vast empire, spanning Borneo, Celebes, the Sulu archipelago, and the southern Philippines by the 16th century, corruption had eroded Brunei\u2019s power, triggering uprisings in the 19th century. In 1841, James Brooke, hailing from London, acquired the governance of Sarawak, beginning the White Rajah Brooke dynasty that endured into the 20th century with support from <italic>Borneo Co</italic>. \n<italic>Borneo Co</italic> began in 1846 as a branch of the Glasgow merchant firm <italic>MacEwen</italic> in Singapore, linked with the Brooke family, rulers of Sarawak. To exploit economic privileges from the White Rajahs, the London-registered <italic>Borneo Co</italic> was established in 1856, with closely held shares and significant involvement from the Glasgow firm <italic>Henderson</italic>, which financed it until the 1890s. In Sarawak, the company engaged in import and export, banking, agriculture, and mineral exploitation.\nSince Boston\u2019s Joshua Bates wed Russell Sturgis\u2019 cousin in 1826 to link <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Russell</italic>, Russell Sturgis became a Partner at <italic>Baring</italic> London by 1851. By then, <italic>Russell</italic> split the Philippines abaca trade for cordage fiber with fellow Bostonian trader<italic> Peele</italic>. After Spain liberalized immigration policies in the Philippines in 1850, an influx of Chinese merchants and laborers began competing not just with Spanish merchants but also native Filipinos. \nWithin a year, the Basque general Antonio Urbiztondo of Spain conquered the Sulu Sultanate, incorporating in it into the Spanish colony. During the same year, Urbiztondo established <italic>Banco Espa\u00f1ol-Filipino</italic>, the first bank in the Philippines. The Basques, exemplified by figures like <italic>Arrechea</italic> and <italic>Ynchausti</italic>, made notable contributions to shipbuilding and trade. \nMeanwhile, Greeks traded with their co-religionists from the Black Sea through the Mediterranean. By 1832, Greek <italic>Lascaridi</italic> hired Dimitri Sursock as Beirut\u2019s agent for the trading goods with the Eastern Mediterranean and Britain, Cyprus, and other regions. Greek Orthodox Sursock was a moneychanger, descended from tax farmers and silk-weaving factory owners in Lebanon. From 1838, the Ottoman Capitulatory system granted granting tax and tariff privileges to European merchants expanded with free trade and religious equality, propelling Greeks and Levantine Catholics, including Crespin, Lorando, and Glavany families.\nWith the advent of coal powered steamers, <italic>Peninsular & Oriental Shipping </italic>(\u201cP&O\u201d) focused shipping from Britain to Suez, Aden, Point de Galle, and Calcutta from 1840, fellow Scots founded <italic>Royal Mail Shipping</italic> to service the West Indies and <italic>Cunard Shipping</italic> to Halifax, Boston, and New York. Britain\u2019s shipping policy promoted direct commerce. So Anglo-Greek shippers of Ukrainian grain bypassed intermediate Mediterranean ports. Likewise, P&O, <italic>Cunard</italic>, and others exported coal and established global refueling ports. \nAcross Chinese Treaty Ports, <italic>Sassoon</italic> and other Westerners used intermediary compradors as middlemen instead of direct trade. Compradors were connected Chinese intermediaries who provided translation services, negotiated deals, and handed financial transactions. Compradors often owned interconnected private banks that were family-run and passed down through generations, reinforcing their control over both local finance and foreign trade. \nFrom the 1850s, the Chen and Gao families from East Guangdong, Chaozhou, established import-export businesses in Hong Kong. While the Chens expanded by emphasizing familial ties and lineage, the Gaos sought managers from fiduciaries. Similarly, China continued to exclude foreign coal miners for decades, including in Korea and Taiwan. \nThe <italic>Treaty of Nanking</italic> combined with international deals between Ottoman Turkey, Egyptian Pasha Mohammed Ali, and Europe to allow engineer Alois Negrelli to lead an Austro-German on behalf of the Austrian government, to establish <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 </italic><italic>d\u2019Etudes du Canal de Suez</italic> alongside French and English groups in 1846 to connect the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. However, financing soon collapsed. \nUnlike the British West Indies banks, France compelled planters to become bank shareholders. The French colonial banking utilized planters\u2019 slave compensation to promote trade credit. Capitalized by deducting funds from indemnities provided to former slave owners, the banks had a note issuance monopoly, and maintained a cash reserve. The administration involved directors appointed by the Governor, regular reports, and government control. In contrast, English chartered Banks lacked monopoly rights and strong government backing. As the French system centralized under government control, English involvement declined. \nPlanting required Peruvian guano fertilizer. As the British <italic>Bland Myers</italic> syndicate ventured into the guano trade in 1841, merchant banker <italic>Gibbs</italic> followed in 1842 amidst a boom. Establishing themselves within the county gentry, Myers settled in Hertfordshire and Bland in Burghfield. However, competition and the discovery of alternative sources decreased Peruvian guano earnings by the mid-1840s. While William Gibbs headed <italic>Gibbs</italic>, he built <italic>Saint-Michael</italic> and <italic>All Angels</italic> churches in Clifton Hampden, Oxfordshire, where his brother was the Rector, in 1847. The same year, Bland married the eldest daughter of the Rector of Burghfield, and <italic>Bland Myers</italic> did not renew their contracts in 1848, allowing <italic>Gibbs</italic> to dominate guano.\nSince British-born Agust\u00edn Edwards helped liberate Chile, his son Agust\u00edn Edwards II, expanded the family mining operations and into merchant banking via <italic>Edwards</italic> by 1845. Likewise, William Gibbs transformed <italic>Gibbs</italic> into a merchant bank by 1851. Supporting the saltpeter monopoly project in Peru, <italic>Gibbs</italic> was the second largest investor behind <italic>Edwards</italic> in <italic>Antofagasta Saltpeter & </italic>RR. Along with connecting the nitrate mines of the Antofagasta area with the port, <italic>Edwards</italic> built <italic>Copiap</italic><italic>o</italic><italic>-Caldera</italic> RR. Moving to Valpara\u00edso in 1851, he made loans, low-interest deposits, and mortgages before Chilean banks existed. By 1855, <italic>Edwards</italic> established Chile\u2019s first joint stock bank, <italic>Banco de Valparaiso</italic>, with investment from <italic>Bland Myers</italic>. \nEurope\u2019s revolutions during the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic> caused many Jews to flee to the Americas. Among them were the Jacobi brothers, born in Prussian Poland, arrived in Peru in the 1850s as American citizens and established a jewelry store. And in New Granada (present-day Colombia), <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen</italic>, led by Christian British descendants of Goethe\u2019s publisher and Bremen merchants, prospered. After Geroge G\u00f6schen began his career in Granada in 1854, he became partner in <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen</italic><italic> </italic>and BOE by 1857, at the age of 27. \nSince Colonial Brazil did not have banking institutions, merchants and suppliers provided credit. After the Portuguese Court relocated to Brazil, they charted <italic>Banco do Brasil</italic> in 1808. Returning to Lisbon in 1821, the Court withdrew substantial resources from <italic>Banco</italic>, which led to the suspension of convertibility of the bank\u2019s notes. The following year, Brazil broke away from Portugal, and signed a trade treaty with Britain in 1828. \nSo, Richard Carruthers moved to Brazil while his brothers traded wine and manufactured products with Portugal and Manchester. While Carruthers soon hired Brazil-born Irineu Sousa, Brazilian deficits and indemnity payments led to the withdrawal paper money withdrew from circulation. After the Imperial family opened <italic>Commercial Bank of Rio de Janeiro</italic>, <italic>Baring</italic> proposed a new loan in 1839. While Sir Isaac Goldsmid became involved, acting in conjunction with a loan in 1843, talks dragged on.\nPart of the intermarried Brazilian aristocracy, Sousa\u2019s extended cousins included Francisco Leite and Caetano Furquim Almeida. In 1844, coffee grower Leite married his daughter to Furquim, a planter and commission merchant who built business ties with sugar planters and sought to industrialize Brazil. \nAfter Carruthers retired, Sousa parlayed his connections to start a bank in 1851 and industrialize the slave-driven agricultural economy. Along with interests in an iron foundry, shipyard, and ranching business, Sousa collaborated with <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and connect Rio de Janeiro to Petropolis with Brazil\u2019s first railway, <italic>Dom Pedro II</italic> RR. By 1854, Sousa became Viscount Maua, and founded <italic>Mau</italic><italic>a</italic><italic> MacGregor</italic> with Alex MacGregor with branches in Brazil, London, and elsewhere in South America. \nWhile Maua illuminated Rio and banked Argentina and Uruguay, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London became Brazil\u2019s exclusive bankers from 1855. As bankruptcies soared amidst the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic>,<italic> Mau</italic><italic>a</italic><italic> MacGregor</italic> survived as some partners failed and <italic>Souto</italic> suffered a run. As, more banks started, <italic>Mau</italic><italic>a</italic><italic> MacGregor</italic>\u2019s promotions grew, including <italic>Sao Paulo</italic> RR with <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and Huguenot <italic>Cazenove</italic>. Amidst this inflation, Brazil adopted a gold standard, restricted banks, and gave <italic>Banco do</italic> <italic>Brasil</italic> a note issuing monopoly. And in Argentina, <italic>Rothschild</italic> agents financed <italic>Cordoba-Rosario</italic> RR. \nWhile brokers in India pledged crops to access to short term credit in London, they were wiped during the <italic>Panic of 1847</italic>. By 1850, the inaugural <italic>Companies Act</italic>\u2014allowing joint-stocks to sue and be sued\u2014to funnel British capital into India for railroad construction and development. Within three years, the civil service passed from EIC to free competition, but the land-revenue system abolished collective security to create separate creditors and tax collectors. By 1855, Parliament introduced limited liability to induce partnerships to incorporate into joint-stocks. \nSince British banks were only allowed to discount \u2018real\u2019 bills for specific transactions, the Scottish textile manufacturer, <italic>Macdonald</italic>,<italic> </italic>and other firms accessed credit for working capital using \u2018fictious\u2019 accommodation paper. As the <italic>Panic of 1857 </italic>paralyzed<italic> </italic>American trade, <italic>Macdonald</italic>\u2014which employed over 39,000 women\u2014and other businesses dependent on accommodation collapsed after BOE raised her discounts rate. Although depositors ran on the <italic>Macdonald</italic>\u2019s bank\u2014<italic>Western Bank of Scotland</italic>\u2014deposits were secured by unlimited liability of wealthy shareholders. Rejecting the bank\u2019s rescue requests, BOE continued to hike the discount rate as her reserves fell, leading banks\u2014including <italic>Western Bank of Scotland</italic> (permanently) and <italic>City of Glasgow Bank</italic> (temporarily)\u2014to suspend.\nOn the grounds of misgovernment by the Kingdom of Oudh, Britain annexed her into India, spurring the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 against EIC<italic>.</italic> After the revolt, the Crown took direct control of British India and stimulated private enterprise with the <italic>Civil Code of </italic>1859\u2014guaranteeing a prior claim for the first property attachment\u2014as well as the deregulation of tea estates, while limiting tenant rent hikes. EIC\u2019s Deputy Chair of since 1801, <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s Charles Mills joined the new Council of India.\nWhile EIC had recruited low Dalit castes for decades, the British Administration shifted away from this practice. Similarly, the <italic>Panic of 1857</italic> stimulated British interest in diversifying cotton supply and the India government eagerly assisted by accelerating land reforms to avoid substituting food for cash crops.\nDescended from a Parsee Grand Priest, Nusserwanji Tata moved from Gujarat to Bombay, and founded a business. The firm first succeeded in 1857 with a supply contract for a British military expedition to Persia. His son Jamsetji joined the company in 1859, managing branches in Hong Kong and Shanghai. In 1863, he dealt with the firm\u2019s bankruptcy while in London. After returning to India, he secured a profitable contract for a British expedition to Ethiopia in 1868, enabling him to start <italic>Tata</italic>. Likewise, Jejeebhoy and their Petit in-laws cooperated in founding <italic>Oriental Shipping & Weaving Co</italic>. \nSince 1853, Queen Victoria chartered <italic>Mercantile </italic>Bank\u2014funded by <italic>Jardine</italic>, Parsee Cowasjee Davar, and others\u2014and <italic>Chartered Bank</italic>\u2014led by politician and Scottish<italic> </italic>Quaker James Wilson. Like other joint-stock European banks, <italic>Chartered </italic>only dealt with large merchant houses in Penang, Malacca, and Singapore. As British law provided fair protection, Chettiars remained an important source of credit for the Malaya. Their knowledge of the creditworthiness of small and medium Indian and Chinese traders, artisans, and tin miners enabled them to secure loans from <italic>Chartered</italic>.\nBy 1854, the punitive expedition of American Redwood cousin Commodore Matthew Perry of Rhode Island arrived in feudal Japan, forcing Japan to open free<italic> </italic>trade<italic> </italic>by 1858. <italic>Sassoon </italic>and <italic>Jardine </italic>were among the first to branch into Japan. Finally, the Dutch lifted Indonesian tariffs in 1865. With limited European involvement, trade between the Dutch Indies and Singapore thrived. While the Chinese accounted for over a quarter of shipping, they had half the share of Yemeni Hadhrami Arabs. Hadhrami share grew in the 1850s, during British occupation of Yemen from 1839 until Turkey regained dominance in the 1870s. \nHadhrami Jews played a significant role in the trade of the region. Despite facing persecution, Yemeni and Hadhrami Jews engaged in banking and other trades that were frowned upon by Muslims. Arab and Muslim bankers and traders established trading associations and branches spanning Africa, Turkey, Persia, and Southeast Asia. \nThese traders, including Hadhrami Arabs, conducted large-scale operations that rivaled Chinese corporations in size and volume. While their banking practices varied based on local norms, Muslims and Arabs encountered challenges associated with their minority status. However, they were able to capitalize on their social organization to enter specific economic niches, despite the absence of commercial laws, legal jurisdiction, religious regulations on lending, influence of clergy, and economic uncertainties.\nOne notable Hadhrami dynasty was the Alawi family, tracing descent from the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s family. Ahmad Muhajir migrated from Iraq to Hadhramaut in 956, giving rise to various Hadhrami Arab families in Southeast Asia, including Alkaff and Alsagoff. These families acquired land concessions through colonial relationships and marriages with the Sultan of Siak and wealthy Bugis traders in the late 19th century. Alsagoff inherited land from the Sultan of Johor and other sources, while Alkaff secured a concession in Upper Serangoon from EIC in 1879. Additionally, these families bought land in the Middle East, East Africa, and Asia.\nThe Austro-German <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 </italic><italic>d\u2019Etudes du Canal de Suez</italic> remained inactive since the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>. And as Egyptian Pasha Mohammed Ali died in 1849, his successors, son Ibrahim and grandson Abbas, showed little enthusiasm for the project. After Abbas was assassinated in 1854, his successor Pasha Said formed a close connection with French diplomat Ferdinand Lesseps, cousin of the French Empress. \nAfter <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 </italic><italic>d\u2019Etudes </italic>removed Negrelli in 1855, Ferdinand Lesseps started <italic>Suez Canal</italic> in late 1858. Despite facing diplomatic difficulties, he bypassed bankers issuing bearer bonds via <italic>Egyptian Bank</italic> and launched excavation work in 1859. Along with financing Beirut-Damascus road construction and port enlargement, Greek Orthodox <italic>Sursock</italic> extended to the Port of Alexandria, and gained favor at the court of Pasha Said. \nAnglo-Greek Peter Pasquali promoted the first large bank in Ottoman domains, <italic>Egyptian Bank</italic>, with funding from<italic> Westminster Bank</italic>. While established to foster Anglo-Egyptian trade, the bank quickly engaged in financing <italic>Suez Canal</italic> and other Egyptian government projects. Across the Maghreb, circumstances where different, but also similar. Like Egypt, Tunisia gained independence from Ottoman influence after France colonized Algeria in 1830. \nAfter the Expulsion from Spain, Sephardic immigrants settled in North African cities like Algiers, Fez, and T\u00e9touan, eventually integrating with local Arabized Jews. When France conquered Algeria, about 25,000, largely impoverished, Jews lived there. Unlike the Muslim population, which often withdrew from the colonizers, Jews in Algiers and Oran engaged with French soldiers for trade, while nomadic Jewish tribes in Constantine maintained traditional lifestyles. Soon after, consistories started in Algiers, Oran, and Constantine, appointing French-trained chief rabbis.\nIn 1841, the Chamber of Commerce of Algiers proposed a bank. The Finance Minister then invited BDF to branch to Algiers in 1844, but several Regents opposed the risk. When creating <italic>Comptoir</italic><italic> </italic>amidst the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, France authorized <italic>Comptoir</italic> Algeria. As French customs law integrated Algerian trade with France in 1851, Finance Minister Achille Fould replaced <italic>Comptoir</italic> Algeria with <italic>Bank of Algeria</italic>. The bank opened a branch in Oran in 1853, Constantine in 1856, and Bone in 1868. Although European settlers and state officials accepted her banknotes, Arab markets refused them, forcing metallic currency imports from France.\nIn Tunis, unlike in other North African cities, the Grana Jews from Tuscan Livorno remained endogamous and separate from the native Twansa. Since setting up branches in Tunis in the 17th century, Grana merchants like Forti, Lumbroso, and Costa kinterlinked and started independent institutions. The Grana dominated the trade monopolies between Livorno and the Barbary States, financing ships, charters, insurance, and ransoms. \nIn 1710, Chief Rabbi Isaac Lumbroso formalized Grana institutions while remaining under the authority of Nissim Samama and other Twansa Caids, who oversaw collective tax collection. Still, Tunisia prohibited the Twansa and Grana from owning property, required to wear identifying red hats in public, and were left out from monopolies in the oil press and other industries, managed by Genoese Christians and <italic>Pastr\u00e9</italic><italic> </italic>of Marseilles. \nAlong with producing several Grana Chief Rabbis of Tunis, the Lumbroso family kinterlinked with the Franchetti, Montefiore cousins Boccara, the Cesana in-laws of a Moroccan rabbinical dynasty, and Forti families. By 1783, Isaac Forti moved from Florence to Tunis by 1783, where he worked as a broker for a French trading house. Isaac\u2019s great-grandson, Joseph, married the daughter of the merchant and Parnas of Tunis David Costa, in 1801, remained a Tuscan national, and became a merchant and Parnas of Tunis. Joseph\u2019s son David worked as a broker for a French trading house until founding his own firm and was naturalized Frenchman in 1847.\nHis cousin, Abraham Forti Lumbroso, studied medicine in Pisa, became Court Physician to the Bey of Tunis, and married a Costa. In 1846, Abraham accompanied the Bey to Paris, where he was honored by King Louis-Philippe Bourbon. Following his services during the cholera epidemic of 1849, he was appointed Consul of San Marino in Tunis in 1856 and received a barony from King Victor Habsburg Savoy of Italy.  \nIn 1856, British Consul-General in Tunis Richard Wood obtained authorization from Muhammad Bey of Tunis to establish <italic>Anglo-Tunisian Bank</italic>. In 1857, Chief Minister Mustapha Khaznadar expanded financial arrangements with Europeans and became a director of <italic>Anglo-Tunisian Bank</italic>, while Wood and his French counterpart, Leon Roches persuaded the Bey to issue reforms. The following year, the Bey granted Jews property rights and removed the requirement for distinctive clothing. \nLikewise, a constitution planned for 1861 sought to establish a legislative body, modernize the judiciary, implement economic reforms, and expand civil rights. Also in 1858, <italic>Anglo-Tunisian Bank</italic> received a forty-year monopoly on legal tender issuance, despite French objections. The same year, Khaznadar rejected an offer from Roches to secure financial support for the government from <italic>Rothschild</italic>, while the Bey eliminated the monopoly on olive oil presses, authorized coasting trade for foreigners, and Khaznadar chaired a commission to draft a constitution.\nDespite Khaznadar\u2019s promise for a reformist constitution in 1861, his <italic>Anglo-Tunisian Bank</italic> directorship removed his sense of urgency. As British and French counsels pressured the Bey for reforms, French influence led Tunisia to abandon <italic>Anglo-Tunisian Bank</italic> in favor French-backed finance. While his Twansa Court Jew Nissim Samama offered a domestic loan, it was not enough, and so Khaznadar secured an international loan from <italic>Erlanger</italic> in 1863 and doubled the personal tax. In response to the resulting unrest in 1864, Khaznadar sought further financing from <italic>Erlanger</italic>, <italic>Oppenhym</italic>, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>, and <italic>Comptoir</italic> in 1865 with approval from Minister of Finance Achille Fould.\nDuring the blockade of the South during the <italic>Civil War</italic>, European cotton, flax, and linen markets boomed, including in Ireland. As empires industrialized domestically, America\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic> spurred imperialistic banking to develop coal and cotton industries in India, China, Egypt, and other emerging markets. \nAlthough <italic>Rothschild</italic> London had funded the Ottomans in the <italic>Crimean War</italic> in 1854 and <italic>Glyn </italic>founded <italic>Ottoman</italic> <italic>Bank </italic>with <italic>Baltazzi</italic>, the inflation of Turkish paper money emitted during the <italic>Crimean War</italic> and <italic>Mir\u00e8s</italic> crisis of 1861 led investors to coordinate. So, <italic>Ottoman</italic> <italic>Bank</italic>,<italic> Glyn</italic>, <italic>International Financial Society\u2014</italic>including <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Stern</italic>, <italic>Fr\u00fchling </italic><italic>G\u00f6schen</italic>, <italic>Sulzbach</italic> of Frankfurt, <italic>Pereire,</italic> <italic>Oppenhym Alberti</italic>\u2014, <italic>Camondo</italic>, <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>, <italic>Ralli</italic>, <italic>Baltazzi</italic>, and <italic>Zafiropoulo Zarifi</italic>, and other investors into <italic>TURK</italic> in 1863 to monopolize and centralize paper money and trade credit and build <italic>Suez Canal</italic>. \nIn London, <italic>Ralli</italic>, <italic>Rodocanachi</italic><italic>,</italic> <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic><italic> Goldschmidt</italic>, and <italic>Stern</italic> invested in the new <italic>Imperial Bank</italic><italic>.</italic> The same year, Turkey granted a concession for <italic>Ruse</italic><italic>-</italic><italic>Varna</italic> RR in Bulgaria to a group including William Gladstone, to link the cities that served as British trade centers, with imports from Constantinople via <italic>Lloyd</italic> Austria, and British firms supplying rails, engines, and personnel\nIn Egypt, <italic>Sursock</italic>, <italic>Sassoon</italic>, <italic>Camondo</italic>, and others funded <italic>Suez Canal</italic> since 1861. However, upon the death of Pasha Said in 1863, his nephew Ismael inherited the throne along with a substantial debt, and shortly after he interrupted <italic>Suez Canal</italic> construction because he believed that forced labor disrupted rural life. The following year, Lesseps gained the support of Emperor Napoleon III, new shares were issued, more efficient equipment arrived, and European workers replaced servile labor. During this period, Ismael invested heavily in public works during his reign, including canals, bridges, railways, and improvements to Alexandria harbor.\nAs <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s Julius Blum opened branches in Egypt and Trieste, <italic>TURK</italic> branched to the Jewish metropolis of Turkish Salonica on the border with Greece. Out of Beirut, the Levantine Catholic Crespin, Lorando, and Glavany families were pivotal in the restructuring of Ottoman state finances. However, the Tanzimat reforms of the 1860s sought to limit the excessive privileges granted through Capitulations which had benefited the Levantine business elite.\nWhile <italic>Parliament</italic> allowed the post-<italic>Panic of 1720</italic> Act of 1734 limiting stock jobbing and short selling, they extended an 1845 anti-gambling law to enforce derivative contracts in 1861. Still, Indian courts denied derivatives. Since the collapse of partnerships like <italic>Carr Tagore</italic> and other Brahmin Bengali and British JVs in the <italic>Panic of 1847</italic>, Bengalis eschewed modern banking. \nAlso in 1861, the d\u2019Worms brothers sold their interest in <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Ceylon tea from 1841 to <italic>Oriental Bank</italic>, which floated <italic>Ceylon Co</italic>. By 1862, <italic>Cazenove </italic>helped form <italic>Bank of Hindustan</italic>. The same year, Alex Wallace of Burmese trader <italic>Wallace</italic> obtained a teak concession from the Burmese King. \nAs his brother Lewis started <italic>Wallace</italic> London that year, the family incorporated their Burma assets as <italic>Bombay Burmah Trading Corp</italic>, with Parsee\u2014including <italic>Wallace</italic> co-founder Framjee Patel\u2014and Hindu directors and <italic>Wallace</italic> as perpetual manager. While <italic>Wallace</italic> served as Ceylon\u2019s financial agent, Lewis became a director, later Chair, of <italic>Commercial Bank of India</italic>. In 1887, Alex was appointed to the Court of BOE\u2014serving as Governor for two years from 1905\u2014and his daughter wed Winston Spencer-Churchill\u2019s cousin by 1901.\nAlthough Parliament extended limited liability to joint-stock banks by 1855, Indians did not form banking companies. <italic>Bank of Rohilkund</italic>, founded in 1862, became the first Indian-promoted institution by overcoming opposition from moneylending classes with support from the Nawab of Rampore. Since the British occupation of Sind, Karachi became the seaport for the Punjab and its hinterland by the late 1850s, leading <italic>Chartered Bank </italic>to open an agency there in 1863 during the cotton boom. Due to competition and insufficient European business, the agency dealt in local bills of exchange (\u201choondees\u201d), which lacked documentation.\nSince <italic>Oriental Bank </italic>established Singapore\u2019s first bank in 1846, <italic>Chartered Mercantile</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> established branches in Singapore and Penang in 1859. With capital from merchants in China, Boston Brahmin <italic>Russell</italic> founded China\u2019s first foreign shipping company, <italic>Shanghai Shipping</italic>, in 1862. Within a year, <italic>Smyth</italic>-interlocked <italic>Jardine</italic> founded Hong Kong\u2019s first large shipyard, <italic>Whampoa Dock</italic>, to better trade cotton. After introducing steamboats to China, <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s <italic>Shanghai Steam </italic>virtually monopolized steam traffic on the Yangtze River and some other routes, competition grew. \nLikewise, Scottish shipping entrepreneur William Mackinnon expanded trade in India, Burma, and the east coast of Africa. After founding <italic>Mackinnon Mackenzie</italic> in India with his schoolmate in 1847 and founded what became <italic>British India Shipping</italic> in 1862, outcompeting local Scottish trader shippers such as <italic>Findlay</italic> in Burma. While Scots affiliated with <italic>British India Shipping</italic> sought to refine Burmese oil, they failed as the royal monopoly restricted supplies and refiners refused to engage in bribery to secure consistent deliveries.\nAs an answer to British India, France built Indochina in Southeast Asia over a century after <italic>Indes</italic> first entered Vietnam. To protect Catholic missionaries, expand trade, and establish colonial authority, France invaded southern Vietnam in 1858. After prolonged conflict, the <italic>Treaty of Saigon of 1862</italic> forced Emperor Tu Duc to cede the provinces of Gia Dinh, Dinh Tuong, and Bien Hoa to France, formalizing French colonial rule in Vietnam. \nThe treaty also granted religious freedom to Catholics and commercial privileges to France. As <italic>Comptoir</italic> opened a Hong Kong branch in 1862, France soon established a protectorate in Cambodia. Moreover, <italic>Comptoir</italic> became France\u2019s most important colonial bank, with agencies in Tunisia, Egypt, and British Oceania, financing overseas trade and arranging war loans.\nAt the instance of British shipper P&O <italic>Steam</italic>\u2019s Hong Kong director Sutherland to finance Far East commerce, the Scot advocated the \u2018Scottish principles\u2019 of self-regulation. Having marry-partnered with <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Sassoon</italic> cofounded <italic>Hongkong & Shanghai Bank</italic> (\u201cHSBC\u201d) with <italic>Dent</italic> and local merchants in 1864 over opposition from <italic>Jardine</italic>, which saw her FX trade threatened. HSBC\u2019s notes became in time the preferred currency across China. \nWithin a year, HSBC invited <italic>Russell</italic> to become one of her most important shareholders. As <italic>Russell\u2019</italic>s Chair William Forbes was elected an HSBC director, <italic>Russell</italic> became HSBC\u2019s Philippines agent. While <italic>Jardine</italic> funded a twelve-mile <italic>Shanghai-Woosung</italic> RR in 1865, Chinese opposition prevented completion for a decade. \nSince the abolition of Hong merchants, numerous coast Chinese merchants engaged in foreign trade. Chi-chang Teng, HSBC\u2019s Hankow comprador from 1865, negotiated between the British and Chinese governments with Kuang-yung Hu. From Chekiang, Hu managed the forwarding office in Shanghai to supply Tso\u2019s army and operated <italic>Fu-kang Bank </italic>in the 1870s. <italic>Sassoon</italic>\u2019s Tientsin comprador Mei-pin Hoo also managed his dealing shops in Mongolia, Peking, Tientsin, and Shanghai. His main tasks were the sale of opium and shirtings and gold shipments abroad from Shanghai as remittance for the opium. Some compradors challenged tradition. <italic>Jardin</italic>\u2019s Shanghai comprador Takee\u2019s daughter married an American army commander in 1861.\nLikewise, organized European finance entered South America. After co-founding <italic>Standard Bank</italic> in South Africa, Chair John Paterson co-founded <italic>Mexican Bank</italic> amidst a South American banking boom.. Since Brazil restricted bank activities and adopted the gold standard in 1860, bank insolvencies grew. At the same time, reduced currency risk attracted British banks. As <italic>London & River Plate Bank</italic> became Britain\u2019s first South American bank in Argentina by 1862, <italic>Glyn</italic>, <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic>, and <italic>Grenfell</italic> funded <italic>London & Brazilian Bank </italic>ten days later with Joseph Montefiore as the Chief Cashier. \nWhile<italic> London & Brazilian Bank </italic>took over <italic>Anglo-Portuguese Bank</italic> as more banks formed, <italic>Bevan</italic> joined Anglican <italic>Knowles Foster</italic>\u2014<italic>Bank of Portugal</italic>\u2019s London bankers\u2014to fund <italic>Brazilian & Portuguese Bank</italic> with Portuguese aristocrats. As <italic>London & Venezuelan Bank </italic>formed to fund cotton amidst America\u2019s Civil War, the Catholic Church lost her control over Latin American large-scale credit through consuetudinary practices. In Colombia, commercial houses increasingly provided credit as the Church\u2019s influence declined and efforts to create banks culminated in <italic>Law 35 of 1865</italic>, which allowed regional governments to engage in free banking by adopting America\u2019s . \nSimilarly, Argentina promoted free banking and bought out the railroads of 1820s from the Basque Casares family, whose cousins founded <italic>Murrieta</italic> in London. By then, <italic>London & South American Bank</italic>\u2014with interlocked directors of <italic>Oriental Bank</italic> and <italic>London & County Bank</italic>\u2014opened in Lima, with Peru\u2019s President offering tax exemption and equal participation in future banking concessions. \nAs Emperor Napoleon III captured Mexico\u2019s liberal government, he negotiated with conservatives to elect Austrian Habsburg Archduke Maximilian, heir of German-Spanish Emperor<italic> </italic>Charles V, to Mexico\u2019s throne. While France, <italic>London & South American Bank </italic>merged with <italic>Standard Bank</italic>-affiliated<italic> Mexican Bank</italic> into <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic>\u2014and sharing John Paterson as a Chair with<italic> </italic><italic>Standard Bank</italic>\u2014<italic>Mobilier</italic> and <italic>Baring</italic> planned <italic>Mexican National Bank</italic>..\nAlthough <italic>International Financial Society</italic> deemed a Chilean railway project unattractive despite a government guarantee, they joined <italic>Gibbs</italic> to construct<italic> Imperial Mexican</italic> RR, they linked with <italic>International Financial Society</italic>. However, the investment was small and continuing political instability led the consortium to break ties with <italic>Mobilier</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Laffitte</italic> and <italic>Irish</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>funded <italic>Peruvian</italic> RR. But with limited funding, the venture soon relied on dubious accounting. \nAs cotton and flax prices fell with the end of America\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic>, Quaker <italic>Overend Gurney</italic> converted into a limited liability bank and India passed the <italic>Insolvency</italic> <italic>Act of 1865</italic> for Bombay traders ahead of July settlement. The run to insolvency dried Indian credit. Under limited shareholder liability, capital calls lost value as shareholders declared insolvency. As insolvencies accelerated, the note-issuing <italic>Bank of Bombay</italic> collapsed, spreading famine along the eastern coast. India revised dishonored bills of exchange summary judgements and repealed the <italic>Insolvency Act</italic>. India\u2019s collapse reverberated to Britain as investor failures cascaded. \nWithout the security of unlimited shareholder liability, depositors ran on the joint stock <italic>Overend Gurney </italic>and the firm collapsed days after BOE hiked its rate and denied a rescue as <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s George Grenfell Glyn and two others issued a negative examination report to BOE, leading to a denial of aid. With the collapse of the <italic>Overend Gurney</italic> during the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>, numerous colonial banks failed, including <italic>Agra Masterman;</italic> <italic>Bank of Hindustan, China & Japan</italic>; <italic>Bank of Queensland</italic>; <italic>New Zealand Banking Corp</italic>; <italic>Peninsular</italic>, <italic>West Indi</italic><italic>es</italic><italic> & Southern Bank</italic>; <italic>London & Bombay Bank</italic>; <italic>Asiatic Bank</italic>; and <italic>Oriental Commercial Bank</italic>. \nWhile <italic>Agra </italic>Masterman\u2019s <italic>British California</italic><italic> </italic>of San Francisco collapsed, their <italic>Anglo-Egyptian Bank</italic> allied with <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Foncier</italic>. Since <italic>Zafiropoulo Zarifi</italic>\u2019s brother-in-law textile trader Alex Ionides became Consul General of Greece in London and co-founded <italic>Bank of London</italic> during the <italic>Crimean War</italic>, <italic>Bank of London </italic>failed during the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>. As textile shipper Michael Spartali, an in-law of Ionides and Ralli, replaced Ionides as Consul General of Greece, his daughter married <italic>Bischoffsheim</italic> <italic>Goldschmidt</italic>\u2019s Edouard Bischoffsheim Cah\u00e9n.\nAlong with cotton routes built because of the <italic>Civil War</italic>, the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic> spurred new connections as Anglo-Russian <italic>DeJersey </italic>banker Ludwig Knoops founded <italic>Knoop Hanemann</italic> in New York and New Orleans. As Parliament banned short selling of bank stock, Quaker bankers formed new partnerships. <italic>Oriental Bank </italic>emerged strong from the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>, even as she rapidly developed likely the most extensive branch system ever seen in a commercial bank, spanning Bombay, Calcutta, Colombo, Cape Town, Durban, Foochow, Kobe, Hong Kong, Kandy, Madras, Mauritius, Melbourne, Port Elizabeth, Sydney, Point de Galle, Shanghai, Singapore, and Yokohama, excluding twelve sub-agencies, with deposits in Scotland. \nWith the failure of several Hong Kong banks and British shipping banker <italic>Dent</italic>, <italic>Butterfield Swire</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Jardine</italic> accelerated in the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>, with the former opening a Shanghai branch and the latter issuing loan for China.<italic> </italic>As <italic>Delhi & London Bank</italic> changed headquarters from India to London, John Smyth became a director, sitting on the India Office\u2019s military fund committee and soon also chairing <italic>Madras</italic> RR. While <italic>Tata</italic> suffered in India, <italic>Sassoon</italic> and trade grew, competing interests with Chinese bankers led HSBC to play central banker and stabilize Pacific credit. \nLikewise, <italic>Peruvian</italic> RR had to liquidate. That year, the Polish-born Jacobi brothers established a currency exchange in Lima soon becoming the capital\u2019s best financier and became an agent of <italic>Rothschild</italic>. After <italic>Imperial Mexican</italic> RR stopped work due to insolvency in 1866, Mexico revolted and executed Maximilian Habsburg and several Mexican conservatives within months. With the Austro-French reign over, <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic> became dominant. \nFollowing European destabilization of feudalism, Japan\u2019s <italic>Meiji Restoration</italic> centralized power in Emperor Meiji to replace feudalism with capitalism in 1868. As <italic>Jardine</italic> financed British miners to modernize a Japanese colliery and French engineers modernized <italic>Sumitomo</italic>\u2019s large copper mines, Japan nationalized other copper, iron, and coal mines\u2014including the large Miike colliery\u2014and abolished usury laws. And Russia, unable to compete in Alaskan coal sales due to Japanese competition, proposed a sale to America with <italic>Schepeler</italic> Riga as a negotiator.\nThe opening of the <italic>Suez Canal</italic> in 1869 spurred new financial links. <italic>Creditanstalt</italic> Alexandria transformed into <italic>Austro-Egyptian Bank</italic> in collaboration with <italic>Anglo-Austrian Bank</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Franco-Egyptian Bank</italic> in 1870, with funders including Joseph Gunzburg and Paul Haarbleicher, who had married a Rheims, related to the Fould, Aron, and Lazard families. \nBy 1869, the intensification of trade pushed Burma, Malaya, and Ceylon further into the world market. With increasing demand for colonial export crops and raw materials, the demand for credit in the local money markets for investment in production and mining grew rapidly and led Indian traders like Chettiar to flourish. \nIncreasingly steamships replaced sail as <italic>Suez </italic>provided an all-steamer route, substantially improved coal economy and speed. As much of her fleet became obsolete, P&O <italic>Steam</italic> multiplied ship size, speed, and comfort under the leadership of Thomas Sutherland. Despite dilution of Scottish investors, Sutherland registered half of P&O\u2019s ships at Greenock, which he represented in Parliament. However, <italic>Cunard Shipping</italic> reorganized in 1880, moving from Glasgow to Liverpool. \nAlong with increased trade, global coal prices inflated as America, Europe, and Japan industrialized. So, investors funded banks, PUs, and roads across Austrian and German Silesia. In Latin America, the blending of public and private interests was prominent when dealing with credit and industry. Political offices often became integrated into family enterprises, leading to a blurred distinction between public and private sectors. \nSince Colombia\u2019s <italic>Law 35 of 1865</italic> allowed regional governments to engage in free banking, the State of Antioquia founded <italic>Banco de Antioquia</italic> (\u201cBdA\u201d) with regional elites in 1872. Within a decade, Antioquia had eight interconnected banks, including <italic>Banco de Medell\u00edn</italic>, <italic>Banco Agr\u00edcola</italic>, and <italic>Banco de Yarumal</italic>, coordinated by BdA. Family-run banks included <italic>Restrepo</italic>, <italic>Villa</italic>, and <italic>V\u00e1squez </italic><italic>Uribe</italic>. \nEduardo V\u00e1squez held shares in BdA, <italic>Banco de Medell\u00edn</italic>, <italic>Banco Agr\u00edcola</italic>, <italic>Banco de Yarumal</italic>, and <italic>V\u00e1squez </italic><italic>Uribe</italic>, while Max Restrepo Uribe served on boards of <italic>Banco de Fredonia</italic>, <italic>Banco Alem\u00e1n Antioque\u00f1o</italic>, <italic>V\u00e1squez </italic><italic>Uribe</italic>, and <italic>Banco de Sucre</italic>. Vicente Villa led <italic>Villa</italic> and invested in mining, agriculture, and other commercial ventures. Likewise, banks, like <italic>Banco del Cauca</italic> of 1873, helped resolve disputes and consolidate regional power. \nAs Jewish financiers like <italic>Henriques</italic> <italic>Senior</italic>, <italic>Maduro</italic>, <italic>Edwards Henriquez</italic>, <italic>Cunel</italic>, and <italic>Correa</italic> thrived in Cura\u00e7ao, <italic>Henriques Senior</italic>, <italic>Correa</italic>, <italic>Curiel</italic>, and others traded in Colombia\u2019s Barranquilla, the primary port for commerce with Nueva Granada\u2019s interior. <italic>Banco de Barranquilla</italic> started in 1872, with significant participation from these Sephardi Jews and other foreigners, soon becoming Colombia\u2019s largest financial institution after <italic>Banco de Bogota</italic>.\nLikewise, since <italic>Gibbs</italic>\u2019 guano monopoly syndicate with <italic>Erlanger</italic> ended in 1866, Peru granting <italic>Dreyfus </italic>a monopoly over the sale of guano in Europe to back a bond issue in 1869. While his brothers banked in Paris, Auguste Dreyfus converted and moved to Lima, where he wed a sister-in-law of a <italic>Banco del Per\u00fa</italic><italic> </italic>director. As he secured financial backing from <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic>,<italic> Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, and <italic>Leiden Premsel</italic>, Premsel joined the board of <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>. By 1872, Schr\u00f6der extended advances to Dreyfus, as <italic>Stern.</italic> and <italic>Bischoffsheim Goldschmidt</italic> of London and <italic>Lieben Koingswarter</italic>, <italic>Premsel</italic>, and <italic>Warburg</italic> of Hamburg participated in a Peruvian loan.\nHowever, guano, Peru\u2019s primary source of revenue for 30 years, saw a steady decline in quantity, quality, and market demand compared to its peak in the 1860s. This decline led to the emergence of two new growth sectors in the Peruvian economy: sugar production in the north and nitrate extraction and manufacture in the southern Tarapaca province. Between 1868 and 1873, British consumers doubled nitrate use, and companies like <italic>Tarapaca Nitrate Co</italic>, partly owned by <italic>Gibbs</italic>, replaced small old mines with larger, mechanized ones.\nSince <italic>Dreyfus</italic> removed guano-related financial flows from <italic>London Bank of Mexico </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> South America</italic>, the latter shifted to rising nitrate exports from Tarapaca. In March 1873, the Minister of Finance postponed a nitrate monopoly project. In July 1873, he increased export duties on nitrate. After price collapsed with the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, competition intensified between guano and nitrate, and leading to renegotiations of contracts.\nPeru nationalized nitrates in 1876, paying mine owners with short-term bonds and<italic> Gibbs</italic> to run nitrate offices to establish a nitrate monopoly. In 1878, <italic>Sawers</italic> and <italic>Rowe</italic> replaced <italic>Gibbs</italic> as government agents. In the 1870s, <italic>Balfour Williamson</italic> bought nitrate offices and opened an office at Iquique to bring in bags, fuel, and equipment. After the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Peru attempted and Bolivia, which served as a secret ally by leasing and selling deposits of the nitrate-rich Atacama Desert and imposing export taxes. With growing tensions with Chile, the <italic>War of the Pacific</italic> raged from 1879 to 1884. \nAs <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic> co-operated with Chile during the war and later withdrew all her Peruvian notes, <italic>Rothschild</italic>-backed Sigmundo Jacobi donated monthly for the army\u2019s upkeep. When Peruvian banknotes lost value due to lack of backing, he proposed to the Minister of Finance to exchange these banknotes at par, provided the Minister issued the order for them to be accepted at all Peruvian Customs offices. \nThis agreement was arranged with the Minister\u2019s approval, and over two million large discount banknotes were exchanged for smaller ones at par. After the war, however, the Minister refused to fulfill his agreement, leading to a riot. Jacobi was attacked in his house and had to escape over the rooftops to save his life. While the Jacobi family lost a significant portion of their fortune, they remained charitable and active.\nThe <italic>War of the Pacific</italic> transferred control of nitrate and guano deposits from Peru and Bolivia to Chile. This shift ended Dreyfus\u2019s guano trade with Peru and made Chile the main exporter of these resources while weakening its neighbors\u2019 economies.As Dreyfus sued Premsel, Premsel attempted suicide by jumping into the Seine, dying soon after. As foreign trade on the West Coast shifted from Peru to Chile, British merchant-banking houses such as <italic>Huth</italic> and <italic>Gibbs</italic> closed Peruvian operations and expanded in Chile, while <italic>Grace</italic>, <italic>Gildemeister</italic>, and <italic>Rowe</italic> remained in Peru due to immobilized credits in sugar estates and Peruvian government debt.\nWhile <italic>Gibbs</italic> held nitrate for sale in Europe, kept production contracts and certificates, and operated property and equipment in Peru, <italic>Balfour Williamson</italic> arranged shipments from mine owners and chartered ships, <italic>Gibbs</italic> left Peru and focused on Chilean Iquique. At the time, Leeds-born John North gained control of major nitrate properties. He had joined Leeds steam plough works <italic>Fowler</italic>, which sent him to Peru to supervise operations in 1869 and settled in Iquique to trade, import machinery, and service steamships until returning to Britain in 1882. While his father led <italic>Fowler</italic>, William practiced law until 1877. Marrying a fellow widowed Pease, he became director, and later Chair, of <italic>National Discount Co</italic> in London. His daughter married Edward Barclay in 1883. That year, North floated <italic>Liverpool Nitrate Co</italic>, followed by <italic>Colorado Nitrate Co</italic> and <italic>Primitiva Nitrate Co</italic>. The following year, nitrates producers cartelized following <italic>Gibbs</italic>\u2019 proposal.\nIn Spain, meanwhile, the political crisis of 1872 preceded her emancipation of slaves in 1873. As she refused to create a bank of issue in Puerto Rico using compensation money from the emancipation of slaves. So, Caribbean merchants established <italic>Sociedad Anonima de Cr\u00e9dito Mercantil</italic> as a deposit and discount company instead of an issuing bank in 1877. At the same time, the Basque renewed civil war, driving the Spanish Treasury to expand floating debt, issue new loans, and sell state property while failing to balance accounts.\nSince the 1860s, the British Committee for Spanish Debt pressured Spain to sell her copper mines at Rio Tinto. Although the mines had reopened in 1725, output remained low and never produced returns. The Rothschilds entered Spanish copper briefly at Tharsis in 1854 and then withdrew. In 1873, Spain offered the Rothschilds a sale, but <italic>Jardine</italic> cousin Hugo Matheson formed <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> in 1877. The same year, <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s William Keswick joined HSBC\u2019s Board, and became Chair three years later. \nMeanwhile, <italic>Baring</italic> also made heavy investments while kinterlinking with the British aristocracy and Boston Brahmin. Edward Baring joined <italic>Baring</italic> in 1850, became a Partner in 1856, and\u2014along with his cousin once removed and fellow <italic>Baring</italic> partner Henry Baring Bingham Saint-John-Mildmay\u2014married the aristocratic daughters of former Whig PM Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, and Devon banker John Bulteel\u2014descended from an early Huguenot director of BOE\u2014in 1861. By 1873, Mildmay\u2019s daughter married the nephew of a Grenfell. Edward joined the Court of BOE in 1879, <italic>Baring</italic> handled bond issues for America, Canada, Argentina, and Russia. \nOutside of marriage, Charles Grey had a daughter, Eliza, with Georgiana, daughter of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer. At the time of Eliza\u2019s birth, Georgiana was married to William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, a fellow descendant of Emperor Charlemagne. Due to her birth out of wedlock, Eliza was raised in secret by the Greys. Eliza\u2019s daughter married Henry Brand, 1st Viscount Hampden, a descendant of Charlemagne and fourth great-grandson of King Charles II. \nWhile their son married <italic>Glyn</italic> cousin Susan Lascelles Cavendish in 1868, their daughters wed <italic>Russell</italic> and <italic>Baring</italic> Boston affiliate Russ Sturgis\u2019 great-grandson Henry Sturgis in 1872 and Colonel David Barclay\u2019s fifth great-grandson David Bevan in 1885. During this period, Duke Cavendish\u2019s second great niece married a son of Abel Smyth\u2019s great granddaughter and Claude Bowes Lyon, a coal-land owning Scottish aristocrat, in 1881.\nHowever, Edward\u2019s tenure faced financial challenges, with bad debts exceeding \u00a3150,000 in 1883 and more than \u00a3260,000 in 1884, and a near disastrous \u00a310 million bond issue for Italy in 1882. Still, he become Senior Partner of <italic>Baring</italic> in 1883 and, over the next two years, completed <italic>Canadian Pacific</italic> RR and floated brewer <italic>Guinness</italic>. In recognition of his contributions, Baring was elevated to Baron Revelstoke in 1885 and became Chair of <italic>Lloyd</italic>\u2019s from 1887. <italic>Kidder</italic> became <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>American agent from 1886 as Edward\u2019s son Cecil Grey Baring joined as Partner, linking Britain to America through Boston.\nSince <italic>Rathbone Benson</italic> of Liverpool kinterlinked with <italic>Baring</italic> in 1840s, Rathbone and Benson grew apart, but each closer to <italic>Baring</italic>.  Although his family had left the Quakers in the 1830s, Robert Benson used family connections to found <italic>Benson</italic> to invest in American securities in the 1870s, and in 1887 he married Evelyn Holford, whose sister was married to a Grey. Also in that year, another Grey-Grenfell cousin married Earl Robert Spencer. By the 1890s, Spencer\u2019s Egerton cousins married a British born and ennobled Huguenot Tehllusson. \nAs America\u2019s Congress enacted the <italic>Interstate Act of 1887</italic> (\u201cIA1887\u201d) to eliminate ruinous railroad and transport competition by delegalizing private pooling and stabilizing cartel rates by policing cheats, a regional German court opined on the country\u2019s preference for industry cooperation to achieve planned and orderly development, emphasizing the community\u2019s interest in preventing prices from falling below production costs. \nBut as miners struck in in 1889, German Kaiser Wilhelm II shifted from Chancellor Bismarck\u2019s oppressive social policies to supporting labor reforms, including cartels and limiting child and female employment. As BOE and GRB raised rates in 1889, the international conference in 1890 advocated for global labor standards, coinciding with a coal miners\u2019 strike in Britain involving 260,000, disrupting industry due to coal shortages. \nSince the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Jews consolidated coal assets, including the Arnhold<italic> </italic>and Friedl\u00e4nder families. Founded in the 1864 by the son of a doctor in Dresden, <italic>Arnhold</italic> bank kinterlinked with Warburg cousins DelBanco and Wertheim cousins descended from the Mint Jew of Schwerin. Inheriting his indebted family coal mining firm in Upper Silesia in 1880, Fritz Friedl\u00e4nder acquired competitors. \nAfter joining with <italic>Deutsche</italic> to establish <italic>Association of Upper Silesian Coal Producers</italic> to facilitate price agreements and <italic>Upper</italic> <italic>Silesian Coke Works & Chemical Factories</italic> to introduce the coke industry to the region in 1890, Friedl\u00e4nder wed Milly Fuld of Rothschild\u2019s old Amsterdam agent, <italic>Becker Fuld</italic>. And, as coal demand continued to fall, <italic>Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate</italic> followed the model to cartelize coal in the Ruhr without laying off miners. \nAs American produce deflated, a Japanese currency bank failed, and most of South Africa\u2019s local banks collapsed. Since Australia had allowed banks to invest in real estate from 1888, few failed as British capital rushed in. But the story was different in South America. \nWith strong demand for nitrates, the Chilean cartel from 1884 ended in 1887. Buying a large holding of shares in <italic>Nitrate</italic> RR in 1888, Oliver North co-founded <italic>Bank of Tarapaca </italic>with branches in Valparaiso, Iquique, and Pisagua, appointing <italic>Rothschild</italic><italic> </italic>London as bankers and <italic>Grace</italic> and <italic>Norddeutsche</italic> <italic>Bank</italic> as agents in New York and Hamburg. While North served as Vice Chair, William Fowler\u2014of <italic>National Discount Co</italic> and Barclay in-law\u2014served as Chair. Amidst the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic> nitrate boom that year, <italic>Lloyd </italic>Chair Sampson Lloyd co-founded <italic>Anglo-Argentine Bank</italic> with branches in Buenos Aires and Montevideo. \nAfter over a decade on the throne, Brazil\u2019s King Pedro II, Bonaparte\u2019s nephew, appointed <italic>Rothschild</italic> his European agent in the 1850s. Following America\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic>, Brazil enacted the <italic>Law of Free Birth</italic> in 1871 to pave the way for eventual abolition. When Portugal outlawed slavery in 1875, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and <italic>Becker Fuld</italic> financed Brazilian military operations and the extension of <italic>S\u00e3o Paulo</italic> RR. A year after Brazil abolished slavery in 1888, a republican coup overthrew the monarchy. Despite political turmoil and fears of dissolution of the nation state, <italic>Rothschild</italic> continued lending to the new regime, maintaining a stable debt record to defend the regime without breaking <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s decades long monopoly. \nIn the 1880s, Argentina witnessed intense competition for railway concessions, with Basque descendant families like Casares and their cousins actively involved in the industry. Government-owned railway lines challenged private enterprises. In the 1870s, former Buenos Aires governor Carlos Casares equipped General Julio Roca\u2019s army for the India campaign. Carlos\u2019s brother was the President of <italic>Banco Nacional</italic>, one of Argentina\u2019s two major banks with investment from <italic>Baring</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Gunzburg</italic>-affiliated <italic>Russian & French Bank</italic><italic> </italic>financed <italic>Mortgage Bank of the Province </italic>of Buenos Aires and local investor <italic>Portales Carbonnier</italic>.<italic> </italic>\nAs Argentina elected Roca\u2019s cousin Miguel Celman President in 1886, <italic>Deutsche</italic> Overseas organized with a branch in Buenos Aires and <italic>Baring</italic> promoted <italic>Buenos Aires Water Supply & Drainage Co</italic>. Argentina\u2019s borrowing in <italic>gold</italic> and <italic>pounds</italic>, inflating bills. By 1889, poor crop yields made it challenging to meet debt obligations, leading London to scrutinize Argentine bills closely.\nMoreover, <italic>Baring</italic>\u2019s <italic>Buenos Aires Water Supply & Drainage Co</italic> was poorly underwritten and taken up. On November 8, 1890, Edward Baring admitted insolvency to fellow BOE director Everard Hambro. As Chancellor of the <italic>Exchequer</italic> George G\u00f6schen urged BOE to collaborate with private banks in supporting <italic>Baring</italic>, BOE Governor Lidderdale\u2014a <italic>Rathbone</italic> partner\u2014sought government aid. However, after discussions with <italic>Smyth</italic>\u2019s WH Smyth, Lord of <italic>Exchequer</italic> and Leader of the House of Commons, G\u00f6schen rejected government assistance. \nThe following day, G\u00f6schen and Lidderdale met again, but government denied aid again. So, they proposed a collective rescue operation by bankers. Unlike the adverse report George Grenfell Glyn<italic> </italic>gave BOE when asked to examine <italic>Overend Gurney</italic> during the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>, <italic>Glyn</italic>\u2019s  Bertram Currie was largely responsible for BOE\u2019s guarantee fund. \nOn November 12th, G\u00f6schen offered long-stop support, with the government assisting BOE in bridging the funding gap needed to save <italic>Baring</italic>. As <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Hambro</italic>, and others assisted, <italic>Baring</italic> became the first merchant bank to adopt limited liability. Within months, John Morgan\u2019s nephew married Josephine Adams Perry, a Boston Brahmin descendant of Commodore Perry\u2019s brother and second cousin of <italic>Rothschild</italic> affiliate August Belmont II. \nRefused the same reorg terms as <italic>Baring</italic>, <italic>Banco Nacional</italic> of Argentina defaulted on <italic>Baring\u2019</italic>s loans, amidst the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>. Amidst the economic turmoil, President Miguel Celman\u2019s administration faced corruption allegations, triggering the <italic>Revolution of 1890</italic>. As Minister of War & Navy Julio Roca and the military replaced President Juarez Celman with his VP Carlos Pellegrini to quell the uprising. President Pellegrini dissolved <italic>Banco Nacional</italic> and established <italic>Banco de la Nacion</italic> as a national bank with Vicente Casares as her first President, even as Casares\u2019 cousin bank <italic>Murrieta</italic> closed in London. Likewise, fellow Basque descendant cousins directors of <italic>Nacion</italic> mirrored those of <italic>Banco de Provincia</italic>.\nThe regime also nationalized bank gold reserves from <italic>Deutsche</italic> Overseas and other banks. As the Revolution led to the formation of the Marxist <italic>Union Civica</italic> opposing the oligarchy, the military emerged as a separate power group. As Basque descendant family networks linked military and regional industry, the presidency oscillated between the coffee planters of Sao Paulo and the dairy farmers of Minas Gerais over the next four decades.\nBy 1891, revolt spread to Chile, where<italic> </italic><italic>Bank of Tarapaca</italic> and <italic>Anglo-Argentine Bank</italic> suffered. With the collapse of the nitrates boom, producers reestablished a cartel. <italic>Anglo-Argentine </italic>recovered by 1897, while <italic>Bank of Tarapaca </italic>expanded within Chile by the late 1890s. In 1900, <italic>Tarapaca </italic>acquired <italic>Anglo-Argentine</italic>, opening a Hamburg branch in 1905, New York in 1907, and becoming <italic>Anglo-South American Bank</italic><italic>.</italic><italic> </italic>As <italic>Rothschild</italic> London lost her monopoly on Chilean debt to <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Industriel</italic> soon funded Peru. Kept breaking, <italic>Grace</italic> tried to organize a more permanent nitrates monopoly for Chile with <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, <italic>Morgan</italic>, <italic>Kuhn</italic>, and others in the 1910s. \nLike elsewhere, panics shaped development in the Pacific. After joining the Meiji government in 1868, samurai Inoue Kaoru became deputy finance minister in 1871, and fellow samurai Masuda Takashi joined the <italic>Finance</italic> <italic>Ministry </italic>within a year. By then, Yataro Iwasaki inherited the business in K\u014dchi Prefecture, with privileges connected with local kerosene, tea, silk, lumber, coal, and eleven small ships. As Iwasaki dealt ships of all sizes, he offered better services at lower prices. \nAs the information about the new regime\u2019s policy of converting depreciated feudal notes at face value slowly spread, Iwasaki bought the notes at market prices which funded his rise. Such arbitrage also propelled the rise of tuna trading <italic>Yasuda</italic>. To finance these and buy out feudal lords, the government issued inconvertible notes, which inflated and led specie hoarding. While Japan\u2019s allowed private banks to issue convertible notes in 1872, but only four banks opened. As Inoue formed <italic>Senshu </italic>general trading company to promote exports, Masuda resigned from the <italic>Finance</italic> <italic>Ministry </italic>to lead <italic>Senshu</italic>. \nHaving supported Meiji, mercantile <italic>Mitsui</italic> became one of the government\u2019s official FX brokers by 1872 and funded the <italic>Finance Ministry </italic>subsidized and led <italic>Steamship Mail</italic> with other merchants. <italic>Mitsui</italic> descended from Takatoshi Mitsui. Since Takatoshi\u2019s grandfather had abandoned his warrior rank to become a merchant in the 16th century, Takatoshi left his father\u2019s sake, miso, and pawnbroking business in Matsuzaka to engage in textile trade and moneylending. The family expanded through marriage ties with other merchants and opened shops in Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo. By the 1680s, <italic>Mitsui</italic> lent money to several daimyo, some of whom defaulted, but later secured their position as bankers to the shogunate. \nWhile France and America launched expeditions against Korea in 1871, China distanced herself. In 1874, Japan sent an expedition to Taiwan after an aboriginal tribe murdered 54 mariners. Japan argued that China\u2019s lack of law in Taiwan implied a lack of interest in sovereignty. In 1875, Koreans fired on a Japanese warship. In 1876, Japan and Korea signed the <italic>Treaty of Kwangha </italic>for mutual trade and open ports. \nSince only four banks opened under Japan\u2019s 1872 bank act, Japan amended the law in 1876 without a convertibility requirement, leading to 603 new banks over the next five years. So, Mitsui transformed their FX business into a bank that year. And as Inoue returned to the <italic>Finance</italic> <italic>Ministry </italic>for a cabinet position and dissolved his trading company, Masuda became head of the newly incorporated <italic>Mitsui</italic> general trading company. \nCivil war broke out as Japanese notes depreciated against silver and former feudal lord rebelled in 1877. While Japan reenacted the usury law at 6% in court, notes further depreciated as the government issued more with market rates ranging between 10 and 20%. While the government allowed <italic>Mitsui</italic> to export Miike coal, Iwasaki founded the <italic>Mitsubishi</italic> shipping and trading company. Although government silver sales over the next two years had only temporary effects, the <italic>Yokohama Specie Bank </italic>established to collect gold and silver from abroad nearly collapsed as the price of silver in notes continued to rise. \nBy 1882, the government formed <italic>Bank of Japan</italic> (\u201cBOJ\u201d) to redeem notes from circulation before granting BOJ the right to issue convertible notes in 1884. More than general trading companies with banks, the family-owned <italic>Mitsui</italic>, <italic>Mitsubishi</italic>,<italic> Sumitomo</italic>, and <italic>Yasuda</italic> became Japan\u2019s greatest zaibatsu. Japan also began privatizing, her iron and copper mines. And as <italic>Mitsubishi</italic>\u2019s Iwasaki died in 1885, the government pressured his shipping company to merge with subsidized <italic>Steamship</italic> into <italic>Nippon Mail</italic>. \nBut the lack of cartels and export restrictions fueled textile exports. The wealthiest merchant families in Tokyo came from Omi, a center of hemp production and textile firms, whose most powerful formed the <italic>Goshu</italic> zaibatsu, with the Ito family at the center. Chubei Ito, born into a devout Shin Buddhist landed farming family descended from the Genji military clan, followed the family into textile peddling. \nBorn in 1842, Ito joined his brother on sales trips to Osaka and Kyoto in 1853, and by 1858 he sold hemp cloth in Okayama and Hiroshima. In 1860, he established his own wholesale business, <italic>Itoch\u00fc</italic>. In 1872 he opened a store in Osaka, which by 1877 became a leading textile wholesaler and retailer. He branched to Kyoto in 1883 and Kobe in 1885 for textile exports. In the mid-1880s he invested in <italic>Shin-Buddhist Followers</italic> LIC and and established <italic>Bank of Omi</italic><italic> </italic>to finance <italic>Itoch\u00fc</italic> and other <italic>Goshu</italic><italic> </italic>members in 1893.\nMeanwhile, France expanded Indochina in Southeast Asia. Since the <italic>Treaty of Saigon of 1862 </italic>granted religious freedom to Catholics and commercial privileges to France in Vietnam, tensions persisted, and in 1867, France accused the Hue court of supporting guerrilla resistance, leading France to seize the provinces of Vinh Long, Ha Tien, and An Giang. In 1873, Captain Francis Garnier, sent by Admiral Dupr\u00e9 to resolve a trade dispute involving French trader Jean Dupuis, made demands on the Vietnamese government in Hanoi. When the Vietnamese refused, Garnier attacked and captured the Hanoi citadel in November but was killed in combat a month later. \nThe <italic>Treaty of Saigon</italic> <italic>of 1874</italic> followed, securing France\u2019s control over southern Vietnam and religious freedoms for Catholics. By 1875, <italic>Comptoir</italic> and <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Industriel</italic> cofounded <italic>Indochine</italic> to develop French Southeast Asia. Having co-founded <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, Swiss Huguenot \u00c9douard Hentsch led <italic>Comptoir</italic> from 1872 and became the first president of <italic>Indochine </italic>while his brother Ernest led <italic>Hentsch</italic> from 1879. As <italic>Paribas</italic> and <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> invested into <italic>Indochine</italic> from 1881, <italic>Indochine </italic>branched to Hong Kong and beyond to become the French bank in China. \nBy 1883, PM Jules Ferry ordered a military campaign to establish a protectorate over Tonkin, which France achieved in 1884.Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, the British <italic>Oriental Bank </italic>collapsed requiring a reorg. Despite careful management of widespread branches, localized issues included coffee crop failure in Ceylon, hurricanes in Mauritius, falling Indian <italic>rupee</italic>, and defaulted South American loans. While the reorganized <italic>Oriental Bank </italic>faced French competition, French <italic>Comptoir</italic> collapsed in the <italic>Panic of 1889</italic>, after which she was reorganized into a deposit bank and lost control of <italic>Indochine</italic>, shifting the balance of power of European colonial banks in Asia. \nThe panics also disrupted China\u2019s labor immigrants and trade cartels. Like America\u2019s Congress restricted Chinese immigration in 1882 after Gould paid the laborers less than White miners. During the <italic>Panic of 188</italic><italic>4</italic>, Kuang-yung declared bankruptcy from silk losses. More than affecting traders and bankers, hindered Chinese industrialization and allowed the new <italic>Imperial Telegraph Administration</italic> to take over Kuang-yung\u2019s telegraphs. After bankruptcy of <italic>Sassoon</italic>\u2019s comprador Hoo Mei-pin, conflicting judgments and legal battles eroded the credibility of compradors, revealing the precarious legal position they held. \nStill, American <italic>OIL</italic> gave Ye Chengzhong a monopoly for distributing their products in China from 1883. Although Ye was born poor, he was from Ningbo, a region renowned for producing successful merchants. At thirteen, he moved to Shanghai and started as a grocery store apprentice. He raised capital to build a chain of eighteen stores for importing and exporting hardware, utilizing fellow Ningbo to distribute. \nThe Hos were among the few mixed compradors. Since Mozes Bosman\u2014a Rotterdam-born Jew to a cousin-in-law of a descendant of Tobias Boas and Sampson Wertheim\u2014arrived in Asia around 1857, he worked in Hong Kong from 1859 for commission merchant Cornelius Koopmanschap. In 1862, the firm reorganized, becoming <italic>Bosman</italic> in Hong Kong and <italic>Koopmanschap</italic> in San Francisco. Bosman\u2019s cousin married a Dutch Morpurgo cousin by 1873.\nBosman\u2019s children, born out of wedlock to a \u2018protected\u2019 Chinese woman, adopted his surname \u201cHo\u201d, short for Holland. Western educated Robert Ho chose Chinese nationality and joined <italic>Jardine</italic> as a clerk in 1880, married a daughter of partner Alexander Maclean, and became chief comprador in 1883. He appointed his brothers as assistant compradors, and subscribed to shares in <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s enterprises. \nAs discrimination and competition continued, French Madagascar and Reunion introduced Chinese residence taxes by 1887. China did not develop railways or industry before the mid-1880s. After failing to work with HSBC in 1885, an <italic>Oppenheim</italic> Cologne heir and <italic>Deutsche</italic> formed a bank to support German industry and trade in 1889. \nAlong with continuing to serve <italic>Jardine</italic> and HSBC, Robert Ho<italic> </italic>kinterlinked with the Sassoons\u2014through an unmarried Chinese \u2018protected\u2019 woman\u2014and compradors, extending a network of compradors for British <italic>Sassoon</italic> and <italic>Mercantile Bank of India</italic>, German <italic>Deutsche</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Arnhold</italic>, Portuguese <italic>National Overseas Bank</italic>, and Japanese <italic>Nippon Mail</italic>. However, accusing Ye of financial manipulation and credit abuse, <italic>OIL</italic> fired him in 1893. In rejecting <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s partnership request, <italic>OIL</italic> switched to Western representatives who delegated authority to salaried Chinese agents. Likewise, Japanese <italic>Mitsui</italic> in 1899 and <italic>Yokohama Specie Bank</italic> in 1907 bypassed compradors.\nLikewise, Shanghai\u2019s native banker (\u201cqianzhuang\u201d) cartel lost their monopoly in 1889 as banks in the International Settlement formed a separate guild. This separation may have been influenced by the government\u2019s growing interest in the financial market. The guilds regulated inter-bank interest rates and enforced rules using guarantors. \nHowever, as more outsiders entered the banking business, personal connections diminished, weakening the guilds\u2019 stability. So, tiepiao qianzhuang emerged in the 1890s, attracting deposits by issuing long-term bank drafts. Since the Chen and Gao families of east Guangdong in Chaozhou founded import-export businesses in Hong Kong in the 1850s, they expanded into rice milling, shipping, remittance, and banking from 1890, with the Chens spread to Siam, Thailand, and Singapore. <italic></italic>\n<italic>Panics of African</italic><italic> Colonization</italic>\nIn 1857, <italic>Kerdijk Pincoffs</italic> of Rotterdam took over a British firm\u2019s assets in the Congo and opened trading posts selling fabrics, earthenware, glass, hardware, arms, and liquor, while exporting palm oil, palm kernels, ground nuts, ivory, rubber, and coffee. <italic>Kerdijk Pincoffs</italic> was led by Henry Kerdijk and his in-law Louis Pincoffs, whose brother married Matilda DaCosta, a granddaughter of Meir Pressburger and a first cousin once removed Isaac Goldsmid. Pincoffs entered the Rotterdam municipal council in 1856 and advanced to the Provincial States in 1858. \nMeanwhile, modern banking and colonization began in Africa. Amidst the <italic>Panic of 1848</italic>, France abolished colonial slavery and established <italic>Comptoir</italic> to rebuild Parisian credit. <italic>Comptoir</italic> also oversaw colonial finances, first branching to Algeria and elsewhere, and, under Finance Minister Achille Fould in 1851, established <italic>Bank of Algeria</italic>, <italic>Bank of Guadeloupe</italic>, <italic>Bank of Martinique</italic>, <italic>Bank of Guyana</italic>, <italic>Bank of R\u00e9union</italic>, and <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic>.\nSince Moses Mosenthal became a Protected Jew along the Saxon River Weser in 1700, his descendant Joseph Mosenthal saw his mother die young and his father married a Goldschmidt cousin-in-law. After the <italic>Napoleonic Wars</italic>, Moses immigrated to the South African Cape Colony in 1819. As German Jews establishing trading stations in the 1820s, the British transformed African financing by founding of <italic>South African Fire & Life Assurance </italic>in 1831 and <italic>Cape of Good Hope Fire Assurance </italic>in 1835. <italic>Bank of Australasia</italic> lobbied to extend her banknote monopoly to Africa, Parliament resisted. \nInstead, the Dutch <italic>Cape of Good Hope Bank</italic> in 1836, followed by the first British bank, <italic>Eastern Province Bank</italic>, in 1838. While some Mosenthals moved to London in 1835, Cape Town\u2019s first Jewish community began in 1841, and the Mosenthal brothers started <italic>Mosenthal</italic> in Port Elizabeth to trade wool, hides, and imports. Since storekeeping required extending credits to farmers, <italic>Mosenthal</italic> circulated banknotes for several years, but ceased as <italic>Port Elizabeth Bank</italic> started in 1847. Similarly, the Lippert brothers of Hamburg, in-laws of the Beit, Goldschmidt, Hamburger, and Warburg families, arrived in the early 1840s and operated frontier stores in the Eastern Cape\u2019s wool economy before moving into banking.\nFrom 1840, Britain shifted its anti-slavery campaign inland, pressing African rulers to sign treaties renouncing the trade and accepting legitimate trade, like palm oil. In 1850 Brazil ended legal slave imports and Britian acquired Danish territories possessions on the Guinea Coast, intensifying British pressure on West African states. While the British Navy negotiated with King Gezo of Dahomey, in present-day Benin, Gezo refused to abandon the trade, leading Britain to impose a naval blockade on Dahomey in late 1851. In December 1851 Britain bombarded Lagos, deposed Oba Kosoko, and installed Akitoye, who signed a treaty. \nOver the next two years, Britain consolidated control over Lagos and extended influence across surrounding coastal trade networks. As the slave trade was being abolished, Turkey and Portugal also took steps to curb the practice for British favor. France and Germany also expanded in Africa by signing treaties with local leaders. In France, Alexandre Deutsch-Meurthe, a Lorraine Jew, who started a vegetable refinery near Paris in 1843, was a ready buyer. \nIn Liverpool, Britain, Charles Horsfall of Yorkshire formed palm oil trader <italic>Horsfall</italic> after his family traded with the West Indies and owning property in Jamaica. From 1843, he was Chair of <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> until 1845 and was elected to the Board in 1854. By 1852, a Horsfall of Yorkshire kinterlinked with <italic>Mendelssohn</italic> of Berlin. British merchants also pushed <italic>Jardine</italic> to shift from the opium trade to the \u2018legitimate\u2019 cotton trade.\nLikewise, Mendelssohn\u2019s second cousin Adolph Hertz\u2014born in Hamburg to banker Jacob Hertz and Fanny Bacher, a second great-granddaughter of Samuel Oppenheim and niece of Moses Mendelssohn through his wife, Frumet Guggenheim\u2014converted to Lutheranism in 1822. He acquired ships from 1837 and expanded trade to China, East India, Africa, and Arabia by 1844. \nHertz began shipping cowrie shells from Zanzibar to the west coast of Africa in 1844. His son Ferdinand traveled to Africa, Arabia, and East Indies from 1850 to 1854, while his son John established a Zanzibar factory in 1851. Among the numerous places cowrie imports fueled inflation and taxes were Dahomey and Lagos in return for palm oil.\nAs shippers established regular steamers between Britain and West Africa in 1852, farmers competed to export palm oil. Moreover, as steamers linked other underdeveloped markets, West African warlords began to lose their monopoly on plantation labor of the Americas, acerated by the Euro-American anti-slavery campaigns. \nSo, slaves in Africa worked plantations for their kings. In Igboland, cities like Onitsha and Bonny used thousands of slaves for transport and labor. Chief Kurumi of Ijaye had a harem and 1,000 slaves in 1859, while Ibadan trader Efunsetan Aniwura owned 2,000. Calabar merchant King Eyo Honesty VIII soon owned 3,000 slaves. \nLikewise, Scottish shipping entrepreneur William Mackinnon expanded trade in India, Burma, and the east coast of Africa. After founding <italic>Mackinnon Mackenzie</italic> in India with his schoolmate in 1847 and founded what became <italic>British India Shipping</italic> in 1862. Under Mackinnon\u2019s direction, the company grew to become one of the world\u2019s largest shipping companies, establishing trade routes and subsidiary lines across various regions. \nDuring the blockade of the South during the <italic>Civil War</italic>, European cotton, flax, and linen markets boomed, including in Ireland. As empires industrialized domestically, America\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic> spurred imperialistic banking to develop coal and cotton industries in India, China, Egypt, and other emerging markets. \nIn rapid succession between 1861 and 1864, <italic>Standard Bank</italic>, <italic>London & South African Bank</italic>, <italic>Commercial & Agricultural Bank of Natal</italic>, <italic>Colonial Bank of Natal</italic>, and other British colonial formed to buy existing South African banks, facilitate sugar planter credit, and issuing bank notes in competition with private agencies joined the banks. In 1862, directors from <italic>London & South African Bank</italic>, <italic>Hudson Bay</italic>, <italic>Oriental Bank</italic>, and <italic>Smyth</italic> capitalized on gold discoveries by founding <italic>Bank of British Columbia</italic>. Likewise, <italic>Standard Bank</italic>\u2019s Chair John Paterson co-founded <italic>Mexican Bank</italic> amidst a South American banking boom..\nWhile fellow Rotterdam private banker <italic>Mees</italic>\u2014started a century earlier and led by Christians descended from Emperor Charlemagne and related to the Coymans\u2014also set up East African trade, they were not successful. Amidst the Dutch banking boom, <italic>Pincoffs</italic> and <italic>Mees</italic> co-founded <italic>Rotterdamsche Bank</italic>,<italic> Nederlandsch-Indische Gas</italic>, <italic>Holland-Amerika Shipping</italic>, and reorganized <italic>Kerdijk Pincoffs</italic> as a limited liability company,<italic> Afrikaansche Handelsvereeniging,</italic> in 1869. After a <italic>Lissa Kann</italic> in-law married Louis Pincoffs\u2019 niece in 1870, he became the first Jewish member of the First Chamber<italic>.</italic><italic></italic>\nLike America freed Black slaves, so did Dutch Cura\u00e7ao in 1863. Amidst America\u2019s <italic>Civil War</italic>, Brazil severed diplomatic ties with Britain in 1863. As Paraguay captured a Brazilian steamer in 1864, imperialistic ambitions competition of Portugal, Spain, America, and Britain played out as Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay joined forces against Paraguay. When the bankruptcy of <italic>Souto</italic> triggered panic and bank runs, <italic>Banco do</italic> <italic>Brasil</italic>\u2019s authority to issue paper money, and<italic> Maua MacGregor</italic> survived at the cost of her prominence. That year, Portugal chartered <italic>National Overseas Bank</italic>, connected to Portugal\u2019s <italic>Minister of Navy & Overseas</italic>, to monopolize banking from Angola to Macao. \nAmidst the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic>, South African Natal planters failed, business collapsed, and mechanics lost jobs. As concerns mounted about foreign banks, the Free State outlawed new foreign banks. To counter the potential flight of capital, the government issued paper currency backed by public property. Although South African <italic>Standard Bank</italic> and <italic>London Bank of Mexico & South America</italic> persevered, their founder John Paterson fell into bankruptcy. \nFollowing heavy borrowing, the <italic>Panic of 1866</italic> pushed Tunisia into insolvency. Since his Twansa Court Jew Nissim Samama fled Tunisia and other financiers, including <italic>Erlanger </italic>and the Genoese, refused to lend, Chief Minister Khaznadar turned to the Grana. As David Costa Forti settled in Marseille in 1866, his daughter married Lazare Allatini of Salonika. Forti\u2019s cousin through David Costa, Franchetti-in-law Isaac Cesana was an Italian national and former accountant of Count Giuseppe Raffo. In 1867, Cesana participated in the Tunisian debt conversion commission, lending over 1.5 million <italic>francs</italic> to the state. \nAs Abraham Forti Lumbroso\u2019s daughter married Katz descendant Baron Emanuel Samuel Todros in 1868, his brother Jacques, who served as Tunisia\u2019s Consul General in Marseilles, established <italic>Lumbroso</italic> with <italic>Oppenhym Pinto</italic> affiliated Victor Pinto, engaged in banking, discounting, finance commissions, and the Anglo-Egyptian cotton trade. \nLikewise, Grana doctor Giacomo Castelnuovo founded a bank in Florence and negotiated a commercial treaty between Italy and Tunis in 1868. However, reckless spending and the abolition of the slave trade caused Tunisia\u2019s financial crisis the following year. On behalf of the Bey, Castelnuovo helped establish an international financial commission to manage the country\u2019s finances and debt, for which he received mining concessions and an Italian barony. \nAlthough the international financial commission began supervising Tunisia\u2019s finances, Chief Minister Khaznadar secured British investments despite opposition from French and Italian members of the associated commission. In 1873, Khaznadar was removed and replaced by Khair Din and, under Richard Wood\u2019s guidance, <italic>TURK</italic> formed <italic>London Bank of Tunis</italic> with British backing. The French opposed the bank, particularly her convertible note monopoly, leading <italic>London Bank</italic> to relinquish it. As France\u2019s influence grew, and British financial involvement in Tunisia waned.\nWhile Muslim Algerians avoided contact with French occupiers since 1830, Algerian Jews engaged with them, aiming to trade. At the time, the Algerian Jewish community numbered 25,000, mostly impoverished. While the creation of Jewish leadership and assimilation over the decades, Jewish Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux became Government of National Defense in 1870 and naturalized Algerian Jews transformed their professions and lives with education and modernity. With France\u2019s loss to Germany, anti-German attitudes fused with antisemitic at the time of the decree, but soon died down. \nAfter Turkey took control of Libya, where Jewish communities pre-dated Christianity, the Ottomans appointed Eliyahu Hazan, as Chief Rabbi of Libya in 1874 to initiate Haskalah reforms. As Hazan soon introduced secular education alongside religious teachings, Italian immigrants accelerated modernization. Like they did in Algeria and Tunisia, Livornese Jews connected Libya to Europe. Leading Tripoli\u2019s Jewish community by the 18th century, the Nahum and Arbib families moved to Britain and marry partnering with cousin-in-laws of one another, the Tunisian Cesana, and Egyptian Mosseri families to trade African goods and English cloth.\nFrance, meanwhile, expanded in the Maghreb beyond Algeria. Having sidelined the Genoese who dominated the Tunisian trade, the Livornese Grana and Tunisian Twansa Jews of Tunisia kinterlinked and sought to establish a money-issuing institution after France occupied Tunisia from 1881. However, <italic>Bank of Algeria</italic> obstructed efforts and formed a pressure group with East Algerian businesses and <italic>B\u00e9ne-Guelma</italic> RR to extend her own issuing privileges into Tunisia. While Lumbroso lost her French trade monopoly as Tunisia became a French Protectorate in 1883, the Beys continuing to rule for decades. The Tunisians soon looked to French industrialists. After the first <italic>International Rail Manufacturers\u2019 Association</italic> formed during the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, international cartels spread. \nMeanwhile, European empires scrambled for African colonies for politics and economics. In West Africa, George Goldie\u2019s <italic>Central African Trading Co</italic> merged with three British merchants in 1879, creating what became <italic>Niger Co.</italic> After further consolidating the Niger trade, <italic>Niger Co</italic> secured a Royal Charter in 1886 with administrative rights over the Niger Delta with a commercial monopoly in the region. \nWhile Goldie\u2019s father descended from an old Scottish family and became a Lieutenant Colonel of the Scots Guard and a Speaker of the lower Manx Parliament, his mother was a Taubman,<italic> </italic>one of the two leading Manx families and<italic> </italic>cousin-in-laws of<italic> </italic><italic>Smyth</italic> and <italic>Barclay</italic>. Upon his inheritance, Goldie resigned from the military, explored Africa, and took over <italic>Central African Trading Co</italic> in 1875. \nAfrica had few private colonial banks as the French, Spanish and Portuguese colonial empires monopolized banking. To avoid setting off imperial races, Britain signed treaties with the Omani sultans from 1820 and rejected a protectorate over Mombasa started by the Navy. Instead, Britain supported Omani control over much of East Africa, including in 1875, by suppressing a Mombasa rebellion against Omani rule out of Zanzibar. However, Arabs played a limited role in trade and finance, which British Indians dominated.\nTippu Tip, born Hamed Murjebi in the 1830s, descended from a lineage of Omani Arab traders and slavers. His great-grandfather migrated from Muscat to East Africa and married a local woman and settled near Dar-es-Salaam. Their son Juma led early expeditions along the Bagamoyo-Ujiji caravan route and secured alliances with local leaders, including Fundikira, the Nyamwezi Chief and Sultan of Tabora. Juma\u2019s son Muhammad married Fundikira\u2019s daughter, which bolstered his standing in Tabora, where he based his trading operations. Muhammad\u2019s second marriage was to the daughter of prosperous Muscat family, and their son Tippu leveraged his family connections to become a prominent ivory and slave trader.\nBeginning his trading career on Zanzibar\u2019s coast, Tippu Tip embarked on his first inland trading expedition with his father in 1855, reaching Lake Tanganyika and expanding their trade network. In 1865, he established his headquarters at Kasongo on the Lualaba River. Tippu controlled a vast territory extending from Stanley Falls to Lake Tanganyika. \nTippu\u2019s operations were centered around the ivory and slave trades, and he gained authority over local chiefs and Arab traders. By the 1870s, he was a prominent figure in the Congo Basin, maintaining significant influence over both the Nyamwezi and local rulers. His expeditions were often financed by Indian merchants like Taria Topan of Zanzibar, who provided credit for large-scale operations.\nIn Scotland, after William Mackinnon\u2014of <italic>Mackinnon Mackenzie</italic> and <italic>British India Shipping</italic>\u2014resigned from the board of <italic>City of Glasgow Bank</italic> due to policy disagreements with other directors in 1870, his <italic>British India</italic>, established a mail service between Aden and Zanzibar in 1873. \nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, Belgian King Leo II organized a conference on European colonization of Central Africa in 1876. Among the invited were C\u00e9cile Fould Furtado-Heine, known for her philanthropy during the <italic>Franco-Prussian War</italic> of 1870. Despite not attending, she promptly donated 20,000 <italic>francs</italic> to support establishing scientific and international stations in Africa, a key goal of the era to end the slave trade. At the same time, the King set up the nongovernment <italic>Association Internationale Africaine</italic> to explore and develop Africa. \nGaining the confidence of Sultan Barghash by 1878, Mackinnon won a lease the territory extending 1,150 miles along the coastline from Tungi to Warsheik, and inland to Congo\u2019s eastern province. As the British government refused to sanction the concession, that territory later became German East Africa. \nBy November, Mackinnon, the Duke of Sutherland and Lieutenant General Kemball, and other associates joined King Leo to form <italic>Comit\u00e9 d\u2019Etu</italic><italic>des du Haut-Congo</italic>, with investment from the Dutch <italic>Afrikaansche Handelsvereeniging </italic>and <italic>Rothchild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent, <italic>Lambert</italic>. As <italic>City of Glasgow Bank</italic> failed during the <italic>Panic of 1878</italic>, liquidators sued Mackinnon. After prolonged litigation, Mackinnon was exonerated by the court. Within months, Mackinnon and Leo agreed that <italic>Association Internationale Africaine</italic> could participate in <italic>Comit\u00e9</italic>.\nHowever, Louis Pincoffs had concealed <italic>Afrikaansche</italic>\u2019s mounting losses through intercompany transfers, falsified accounts, and speculative trades. In August 1879 the fraud was exposed, Pincoffs fled impoverished to New York, while his partner and in-law Kerdijk was imprisoned, Marten Mees and other directors were condemned for negligence, and <italic>Afrikaansche</italic> was reorganized as <italic>Nieuwe Afrikaansche Handels</italic>.\nDue to the collapse of <italic>Afrikaansche</italic>, Leo dissolved <italic>Comit\u00e9</italic>, returned investments, and took personal ownership of control of the Congo Free State. Since Leo approached General Gordon through Mackinnon, Gordon resigned as Governor of Sudan to become Governor of the Congo under the sovereign state of <italic>Association Internationale</italic>. While Leo likely knew of Congo\u2019s copper wealth, mining remained of marginal for decades after the head of <italic>Lambert</italic> married a French Rothschild in 1882.\nLikewise, Arabs dominated trading along the Nile. The Zande established kingdoms in the Mbomu River region of present-day Central African Republic and expanded into the Nile-Congo watershed in the early 19th century. Zande aristocrats incorporated subject peoples as soldiers and cultivators, while princes governed frontier provinces and expanded or founded new kingdoms through conquest. \nZande forces intervened in Mangbetu territories north of the Uele-Bomokandi region at the invitation of local rebels, occupying portions of land. Dakpala, a former Mangbetu slave and commander, broke away to form a rival kingdom among the Bangba. Mangbetu King Tuba fought internal rebellions and Nile traders until his death in 1867. His son Mbunza established a capital at Nangazizi, navigated relations with neighboring Zande rulers, and controlled trade with Nile caravans.\nBy the mid-19th century, Zande territories and southern Sudan were organized around the zariba system, a network of fortified commercial and military camps linking the region to international trade. The zariba system employed soldiers, armed slaves, and indigenous laborers, connecting ivory trading and slave raiding. Trading companies expanded from Bahr el-Jebel in the 1860s, linking Bahr el-Ghazal, Dar Fartit, and Zande lands. Zande leaders also integrated with Arab traders. Zubair Mansur arrived in 1856, married King Tikima\u2019s daughter, killed Tikima, and annexed his kingdom. His headquarters at Daim Zubair linked caravan routes from Dar Fartit to the Nile.\nSons of Zande kings gained positions within the zariba. Mbagahli Muduba, a younger brother of a Zande king, learned Arabic, commanded Nubian and Zande troops, and led a frontier territory in 1870. Nubian superintendents and armed contingents who traded, raided, married locally, and acquired servants staffed zariba near settlements. From 1873 to 1881, Nubian and Arab traders from the Nile disrupted Zande-controlled territories through slave and ivory extraction. Integration into Zande trade and military networks reshaped authority, commerce, and social hierarchies.\nAligning with the Egyptian government, King Tikima\u2019s son, S\u00e9mio, consolidated authority over the Haut-Oubangui. Although he was not a genuine Muslim, S\u00e9mio wore Arab robes with a European felt hat and carried a spear. His uncle Sasa submitted early to the Belgians, maintained ties with Nubians, spoke Arabic, and adopted Arabo-Nubian dress. As he oversaw northern and southern Mbomu River chiefs and extended influence south to Amadis and Mangbele chiefdoms, S\u00e9mio\u2019s zariba maintained trade in ivory and rubber, supplied workers in gold, and arranged marriages to Arab, Egyptian, and neighboring Zande elites. \nMeanwhile, since <italic>Disconto</italic> President David Hansemann\u2019s son Adolph wed <italic>Oppenheim</italic><italic> </italic>Cologne founder Salomon Oppenheim\u2019s granddaughter, Emma Oppenheim Kusserow, the baptized daughter of a Prussian General Lieutenant, in 1861, Emma\u2019s brother Heinrich misread the Anglo-French convention of 1882 and reported false trade guarantees to Chancellor Bismarck in 1883, prompting alarm among <italic>Woermann</italic><italic> </italic>of Hamburg and other German merchants and officials. In 1884, his memorandum proposing protectorates led Bismarck to initiate German colonial rule. Kusserow was reassigned as Prussian envoy to the Hanseatic cities. \nGermany\u2019s expansion in East Africa began after Britain rejected William Mackinnon\u2019s 1878 concession. By 1886, through Mackinnon\u2019s influence, Lord Salisbury secured a British sphere of influence on the East African coastline from Wanga to Kipini in 1886. As the Omani Sultan of Zanzibar conceded British control over Mombasa in 1887, <italic>British East Africa Co</italic> incorporated to finance trade, development, and administration under the guiding principles of slave trade abolition, monopoly prevention, and international equality in 1888. \nWith investment from <italic>Coutts</italic>,<italic> </italic>Mackinnon acquired a coastline of 150 miles, extending from the River Tana to Mombasa and Germany\u2019s colonial frontier. With local treaties, <italic>British East Africa Co </italic>claimed sovereignty to a depth of 200 miles from the coast, leading to disputes with the German <italic>Witu Co</italic> and Italy over ports. \nTo<italic> </italic>make way for legitimate mining and construction from 1885, Britain suppressed Nigeria\u2019s slave-trading <italic>Aro Confederacy</italic>. While Germany and France called for free<italic> </italic>trade and an open-door policy in an international Congo, Britain instead supported Belgian King Leo II\u2019s claim to monopolize the Congo Free State in 1885. Instead of a colony, Leo sought a Free State to create a powerful Black state under his direction. \nHowever, Leo\u2019s Congo Free State faced financial difficulties from 1887 due to its dependence on ivory trade and limited financial options. Dismantling the Arab slave trade, Leo appointed Arab ivory and slave trader Tippu Tip as Governor of the Free State\u2019s eastern province at Stanley Falls. As the Free State\u2019s eastern border extended toward Lake Albert against William Mackinnon\u2019s <italic>British East Africa Co</italic>, Leo granted rubber land concessions in exchange for profit and reduced administrative costs. Within a year, administrators of <italic>Congo</italic> RR included <italic>Bank of Brussels</italic> affiliated Jules Urban and Franz Philippson.  \nIn 1888, Charles Rudd, Cecil Rhodes\u2019 partner in <italic>Consolidated Goldfields</italic>, secured a mining concession from Chief Lobengula. At the same time, George Cawston and the sons of Baron Robert Gifford launched <italic>Bechuanaland Exploration Co</italic> to search for gold north of the Limpopo River and build a railway to the Zambezi basin, soon known as Rhodesia. \nExtended cousins of the Grenfell family, the Gifford were colonial servants who fought against the Asante and Zulu empires. Both groups required a royal charter to solidify control over these areas. Negotiating between them, the law firm <italic>Hollams Son Coward</italic> merged their interests, leading to the chartering of <italic>British South Africa Co</italic> in 1889 to administer the territories as British colonies with funding from<italic> Erlanger</italic>. \nSince the 1870s, Bordeaux and Marseille firms pioneered steamship services to West Africa. By 1880, steamers entering Lagos outnumbered sailing vessels three to one and carried six times the tonnage, operating steamers to the West Coast by the mid-1870s, Hamburg<italic> </italic>merchant Adolph Woermann started <italic>German-African Shipping</italic> in 1886 and <italic>Fabre Fraissinet Shipping </italic>organized three years later. \nThe Huguenot Fraissinet family were prominent Marseille merchant bankers during the 18th century. Jean Fraissinet partnered with Dutch merchants Deveer family, extending their network from the Mediterranean to Saint-Petersburg. They also kinterlinked with the local Protestant elite, such as Marie-Constance Fraissinet\u2019s marriage to Jean Baux in 1750. Her nephew expanded the family\u2019s ventures into ship owning and maritime insurance, founding a steamship company in 1836. \nBy then, Marseille\u2019s Greek community of elites contrasted sharply with its 54,000 Italians. Prominent among them were the Chiot Rodocanachi, who moved from Livorno to Marseille in 1826 and established the trading house <italic>Rodocanachi</italic> Marseille, linked with Syros, Odessa, Livorno, London, and Chios. In 1845, fellow Greek Georges Zarifi established a grain trading network in Odessa and a branch in Marseille, specializing in Black Sea grain trade. Associated with <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>, Georges Zarifi\u2019s son Pericles married Rodocanachi\u2019s daughter.\nSince importing Russian wheat, Demetrius Baltazzi arrived in Marseille in the 1830s and a Director of <italic>Comptoir</italic> Marseille from 1848. From 1853, Bordeaux and <italic>Comptoir </italic>controlled <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic>. When <italic>Comptoir</italic> Marseille and <italic>Greek</italic> <italic>National Bank </italic>established operational links in 1879 to settle accounts with <italic>Fraissinet Shipping</italic> and other merchants, the families invested debt and equity into steamship services to West Africa through <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic> and <italic>Co Fran\u00e7aise de l\u2019Afrique Occidentale</italic> (\u201cCFAO\u201d) from 1887. A HC for ventures from 1887, CFAO helped <italic>Fraissinet</italic> and <italic>Fabre</italic> shippers organize into <italic>Fabre Fraissinet</italic> in 1889. Likewise, Pericles\u2019 son Georges wed fellow Greek Vagliano merchant shipping heiress. \nAfter Isaac Pereire\u2019s <italic>Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier</italic> founded <italic>Transatlantique Shipping </italic>during Napoleon III\u2019s regime, <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic>, started in 1865, spread across southern France and northern Africa. <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit</italic>\u2019s directors included the Christian Pastre family, related to the Goldschmidt since 1881. \nThat year, <italic>Transatlantique Shipping</italic> formed an affiliated<italic> Transatlantique Bank</italic>, integrating with shipbuilding and other companies, with directors representing Eug\u00e8ne Pereire\u2014along with his cousin-once-removed  Auguste Pereire Thurneyssen and son-in-law Salomon Camondo Halfon\u2014, <italic>Zafiropoulo</italic> <italic>Zarifi</italic>\u2019s \u00c9tienne Zafiropulo, Jacques Lumbroso of Marseilles, Bordeaux merchant Leon Bloq (whose son married an Oppenheim Halphen), Paul Haarbleicher, and Heri Raba. \nPaul Haarbleicher\u2014an early subscriber to <italic>Indochine</italic> in 1875 and a director of <italic>Franco-Egyptian Bank</italic> (1869-1875) with Joseph Gunzburg, <italic>Parisian Sewage & Fertilizer Co</italic> (1878), and <italic>Waterworks of R\u00e9union</italic> (1881)\u2014had married a Rheims, related to the Fould, Aron, and Lazard families. Already kinterlinked with the Javal, Rodrigues, and Gradis, Caroline Raba of Bordeaux married oil refiner Henry Deutsch-Meurthe in 1877, who received financial backing from the Rothschild family in the early 1880s. \nCreating <italic>Bank of Tun</italic><italic>i</italic><italic>sia</italic> in 1884, <italic>Transatlantique</italic> also secured coal mine interests in France and Indochinese Tonkin through a Rheims marriage. After Auguste Pereire Thurneyssen and his cousin Marie Pereire Rhon\u00e9 married Mallet and LaRoche respectively in 1884, another Rheims was married to Charlotte Fatman, whose American cloth manufacturing cousin married Mayer Lehman\u2019s daughter in 1888.\nAt the same time, other Pereire and Lazard cousin-in-laws developed French coal and trade with Algeria. Since Michel Silny ceased business dealings to become France\u2019s first Jewish Finance Minister in 1848, his nephew-in-law Hypolite Worms transformed <italic>Silny</italic> into <italic>Worms</italic>, a coal and maritime transport company with branches in Newcastle, Rouen, and Le Havre. He expanded to Cardiff, Marseille, and Constantinople, and created the Bordeaux-Hamburg line in 1859. <italic>Worms</italic> opened branches in Port Said and Suez before <italic>Suez Canal</italic>\u2019s completion, and in 1872, his company delivered three-quarters of the coal passing through the canal. \nTheir daughter married L\u00e9on Sciama Franchetti in 1864\u2014relatives of Auguste Dupont\u2019s wife Adele Sciama Ratisbonne and Joseph Foa Sciama, one of the founding engineers of <italic>Suez Canal</italic> and Minister of Public Works for the Viceroy of Egypt, related to Hippolyte Gradis Rodrigues\u2014and Michel Silny\u2019s daughter Marie married <italic>Lazard</italic> Paris co-founder Elie Cerf Lazard in 1867.  While Marie\u2019s cousin once removed, \u00c9lieser Silny, worked as a banker in Metz, becoming a director of <italic>West Algerian </italic>RR in 1879 and <italic>Algerian Credit</italic> in 1881, \u00c9lieser\u2019s brother Moyse banked in Paris and was a President of <italic>Forges of the North & East </italic>from 1895. \nA cousin of the Franchetti,  Lumbroso, and Allatini families, Joseph Forti\u2019s son Jules Costa Forti became a banker, director of <italic>French-Tunisian Society of Industrial </italic><italic>&</italic><italic> Commercial Credit</italic> in 1879, <italic>Transatlantique</italic>, and, after 1884, <italic>Bank of Tunesia</italic>, alongside his cousin Emmanuel Cesana, Eug\u00e8ne Pereire, and Leon Bloq\u2019s son. \nLikewise, Lumbroso kinterlinked with Allatini of Salonica in 1883, who engaging in wheat trade, shipping, insurance, flour, bricking, and tobacco from the 1830s and kinterlinked with <italic>Morpurgo</italic> and <italic>Camondo</italic>. While <italic>TURK</italic> had established a branch in the Jewish metropolis of Turkish Salonica on the border with Greece in 1863, <italic>Comptoir</italic> formed<italic> Bank of Salonica</italic> a year before collapsing in 1889 with the greatest textile merchants, Allatini and Modiano. As <italic>TURK</italic> took over the bank, <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2019s Emile Oulman joined <italic>Bank of Salonica</italic>\u2019s board.\nEarlier, amidst the South African mining \u2018share mania\u2019, Anthony Goldschmidt sold \u00a365,000 worth of Jules Porges\u2019 <italic>Anglo-African Co</italic> shares to rival <italic>Lewis Marks</italic>, who intended to sell them to <italic>Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>. As <italic>Union G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic> went bankrupt before taking delivery, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London and <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris jointly bought <italic>Anglo-African</italic> shares in 1882. The following year, a <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris heiress married Porges-in-law Ephrussi as <italic>Ephrussi</italic> fled Odessa for Vienna. But the diamond mining depression continued, with few dividends paid. \nWith the failure of <italic>Lippert</italic> in 1883, Lippert cousin Alfred Beit combined his claims with <italic>DeBeers</italic>, which soon absorbing other weaker holdings, and represented Jules Porges in London from 1884. As diamond competition from Germany and the Netherlands ended, the heirs of Amsterdam diamond bankers <italic>Lippman</italic><italic>n</italic><italic> </italic><italic>Rosenthal</italic> and <italic>Becker Fuld</italic> kinterlinked through a Goldschmidt May Rosenthal heiress in 1886, and <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Rotterdam agent <italic>Ezechiels</italic> liquidated. Likewise, kinterlinking with<italic> Daniel</italic><italic>s</italic> of Amsterdam and <italic>Lippman</italic><italic>n</italic><italic> Rosentha</italic><italic>l</italic>, <italic>Lissa Kann</italic> of the Hague soon became a public company.\nUnable to negotiate a merger with <italic>Nobel</italic> interests in 1883, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Paris acquired a Russian competitor in 1886, and formed a cartel with <italic>Nobel</italic>. However, the stable profits pulled in <italic>OIL</italic>, which marketed American-refined oil in competition with Baku from 1888. More generally, as Germany\u2019s Company Law of 1884 set high capital requirements for stock market listings, smaller firms could not meet these standards and merged to access the capital market.\nSince the 1870s, California\u2019s mercury mines met two-thirds of global demand for refining gold and silver refining. They also challenged the <italic>Rothschild</italic> cartel, leading to intense competition, especially in China, where New Almaden undercut prices. During the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>, the cartel regained control, causing a sharp drop in California\u2019s sales to China, marking the start of a difficult period for California\u2019s mercury producers. \nAlthough Spain emancipated slaves in 1873, she refused to create a bank of issue in Puerto Rico using compensation money from the emancipation of slaves. So, Caribbean merchants established <italic>Sociedad Anonima de Cr\u00e9dito Mercantil</italic> as a deposit and discount company instead of an issuing bank in 1877. Since 1875, Portugal outlawed slavery, destabilizing plantation-based mortgage banks. However, Arab-Swahili traders continued acquiring interior slaves to undercut European caravans in East Africa.\nLike race underpinned slavery, mulattos sustained the institution. Linked by family, culture, and economics with both Portuguese financiers and the Africans among whom they lived, mulattos acted as middlemen. While many mulattos grew wealthy from the trade, they relied on Spanish ships for transport to Latin America. Only Britain stood between mulattos fusing Africa with end markets in Brazil. \nEuropeans often adopted the African polygamy and fathered mulatto children, who then identified with African mothers\u2019 matrilineal families and worked as elite clerks and agents with Whites. But this was not always accepted. In Botswana, after British adventurer Frederick Selous married Chief of the Bamangwato Khama Sekgoma\u2019s sister and had children in the 1870s, he abandoned and returned to Britain, where he married an English parson\u2019s daughter, the first cousin once removed of Neville Lubbock\u2019s wife. Chief Sekgoma\u2019s grandson later married another British woman that eventually forced him out.\nOther trade links evolved alongside slavery. When a son of the warrior Egba family and relative of Yoruba chief was taken captive and brought to South Carolina in 1805, a Camden planter named him Scipio Vaughan. Scipio later married a Cherokee and, on his deathbed, urged his sons to return to Yorubaland. In the 1850s, the sons bought their freedom with support from <italic>American Colonization Society</italic> and sailed for Liberia. James migrated to Yorubaland, establishing the first Baptist church in Nigeria and became a merchant, trading in commodities such as palm oil, coconuts, and ivory by the 1880s. Vaughan were one of the few American Black families to maintain international contact. \nThe Vaughans were related to the Dibbles, who migrated to South Carolina as merchants of royal lineage and grew into the American South\u2019s largest grocer. \nLike elsewhere, African merchants usually followed their fathers or relatives in trade, distance, and scale. Affiliation with a royal lineage correlated with business success, offering advantages for large-scale distant trade ventures through access to capital, resources, network contacts and marriages, and assistance in business organization. \nAcross the Gold Coast, individual success in trade closely linked to family ties with kings and chiefs. Leading African bourgeois families formed a tightly knit group, recognizing their pivotal role in the colony\u2019s socioeconomic and political institutions. The adaptability of indigenous social structures of the Winneba, Akan, Ga-Adangbe, Oyo, and other African kingdoms facilitated the transmission of trading skills through traditional institutions and fostered entrepreneurship. \nSince Fante Chief Enobaisie Kurentsi sent his sons to France and Britain in the 1740s, a unique Euro-African elite arose in Accra. Euro-Africans like James Bannerman (1790-1858), John Hansen (d.1840), and Henry Richter (d.1849) distinguished themselves through literacy and Christianity. Educated in Europe, they forged lifestyles and dress separate from indigenous traditions. The Ga community recognized their status with the honorific \u2018owula\u2019, highlighting their refinement and learning compared to traditional Ga leaders. This distinction was further emphasized by their adoption of Victorian attire, contrasting with traditional Ga clothing.\nFrom the 18th century, Tettega, an Ada businessman, rose to prominence in the Anlo along the Gold Coast in southeastern Ghana. Tettega\u2019s marriage to Kpetsimine, the daughter of Amegashi Akofi from Woe, bolstered his local influence. Their son, Gbodzo, inherited slave wealth and kinterlinked with a Spaniard, continuing the family\u2019s legacy as a key trader. \nLikely from a related family, Afedima of Woe was known for her fishing ventures along the coast and needed many laborers and slaves to help her in her efforts. She dealt a lot with the Danes and Portuguese and other European traders and married a Spaniard. With the British acquisition of Danish territories in 1850, Gbodzo faced increased European suppression efforts against the slave trade amidst the death of old traders and transitioned to legitimate agriculture. More than their history of slavery, Gbodzo and his descendants concealed their \u2018otherness\u2019 fearing repercussion from the Anlo.\nIn the Niger Delta before the 20th century, kingdoms traded through individual trading houses led by royalty. King Jaja of Opobo moved his prosperous trading house from Bonny to Opobo in the 1860s. Chief Madam Tinubu was another notable trader of this era. These houses competed and sometimes absorbed each other. \nMore inland, in the Kingdom of Dahomey, Visesegan entered the royal court in 1863 as assistant to Chief Wife Yavedo, the palace official who directed the king\u2019s wives. By the 1870s she replaced Yavedo as Chief Wife under King Glele, supervising palace women, sending trading agents to Ouidah, and granting royal licenses for commerce. In the 1880s she managed loans from the palace treasury.\nIn the central Gold Coast, the King of Winneba advocated democratic governance amidst European democratic instability in the 1860s. He spearheaded the formation of the Fanti Confederation in 1868, uniting Fanti-speaking states for collective defense against European colonial pressures. His leadership aimed to strengthen regional cooperation during a pivotal era of colonial expansion in West Africa.\nThe King\u2019s son Kwamin Akyempong (\u201cGhartey\u201d) in started his journey as an apprentice for a Dutch firm in Apam, working as a cooper for <italic>Stoover</italic> for 14 years. Eventually, he traded out of Anomabu as <italic>Ghartey</italic>, expanding over the years to include palm oil exports, gold dust, ivory, and other commodities from various port towns. While his son became King, his brother managed a large cocoa plantation in Akyem-Abuakwa. <italic>Ghartey</italic> often worked with <italic>Sarbah</italic>.\nJohn Sarbah, born into Anomabu\u2019s royal family, started his career as a schoolmaster and mission agent for the Wesleyan Missionary Society. He later ventured into trade and became a prominent figure in Cape Coast, owning multiple retail stores and expanding into real estate. Sarbah also served as a captain in the militia during the <italic>Asante War of 1873</italic>, defending Fanti commercial interests.\nIn the 1870s, <italic>Sarbah</italic> led the expansion of the palm trade on the Gold Coast, establishing branch stations in Winneba with <italic>Ghartey</italic> and Sarbah\u2019s cousin Josiah Mills as agents, as well as the trading centers of Elmina, Ajua, Dixcove, Assini. <italic>Sarbah</italic> directed palm kernel gathering using local laborers and Asante refugees displaced by frontier conflicts. Competing with <italic>Swanzy</italic> around the Volta River, <italic>Sarbah</italic>\u2019s boosted Gold Coast exports of palm from 6 to 15 thousand tons between 1875 and 1895. <italic>Swanzy</italic> was started by the sons of James Swanzy, a surgeon on slave ships who governed two forts on the Gold Coast and a leading slave-trader.\nSarbah, a vocal critic of British colonial rule in the Gold Coast, joined FC Grant in 1878 to petition for African representation on the Legislative Council. In 1882, amidst the gold rush, Grant, <italic>Sarbah</italic>, and <italic>Ghartey</italic> founded <italic>Gold Coast Native Concessions Purchasing Co</italic>. The company aimed to lease mineral-rich lands but faced financial challenges, leading to its closure within a year. Still, Sarbah was appointed to the Council in 1886.\nIn terms of processing tropical forest products like palm oil, rubber, and timber, <italic>Ghartey</italic> and other West African entrepreneurs faced difficulties competing with technologically advanced and well-capitalized European firms. While French <italic>Desmarais</italic> refined petroleum since the 1860s, Alexandre Deutsch-Meurthe, who started in vegetable oil refining in 1843, brought his sons into the business in 1877, with one marrying Louise Speyer Stern Halphen, the daughter of a Paris sugar refiner and a <italic>Stern</italic> heiress, and starting a petroleum refinery in Rouen. By then, more oil refiners and traders rushed into Russian Baku, including Jewish Kagan and the Swedish dynamite inventor, <italic>Nobel</italic>, the latter funded by <italic>Handlowy Bank</italic> of Warsaw.\nSince the 1850s, Charles Horsfall\u2019s sons expanded operations with steamships and trade at Opobo in the 1870s. Like his father, George was Chair of <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> from the 1860s. Having co-founded <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> with <italic>Brown</italic>, the Holts of Liverpool engaged in shipping from Asia to South America. After apprenticing with Holts, Alfred Booth of Liverpool joined the New York branch of <italic>Rathbone</italic>\u2014Liverpool Quakers related to the Bensons\u2014started South America focused <italic>Booth Shipping</italic><italic> </italic>with funding from Liverpool private banker <italic>Heywood</italic>.\nLikewise, new traders entered West Africa\u2019s palm oil trade, leading <italic>Huth</italic>, their cousins <italic>Gr\u00fcning</italic>, <italic>Tobin</italic>,<italic> </italic>and other British traders to merge their local operations into <italic>Co of African Merchants </italic>in 1863, with James Tobin as Managing Director to develop the South Coast trade and act as commission house. <italic>Herschell</italic> of Liverpool entered in 1865, followed by <italic>Banner</italic>, <italic>Pinto Leite</italic>, <italic>Lintott</italic>, <italic>Brunnschweiller</italic>, <italic>Maclver</italic>, and <italic>London & African Trading Co.</italic> The number of traders grew from 25 to 150. \nFirms also expanded geographically. <italic>Taylor Laughland</italic> grew across the Niger Delta, Gold Coast, Windward Coast, and Congo, <italic>Helt</italic>, focusing on Fernando Po in the late 1860s, expanded across the South Coast and Delta under George Watts. Since the slave trade, most of the traders in the delta operated from Liverpool.<italic> Miller</italic> of Glasgow expanded into Brass, Opobo, and the Niger River, becoming a major firm. \nFollowing the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic>, British industry lost competitiveness and consolidated, led by bankers. After acquiring <italic>Bower Hall</italic> with branches in Beverley, Malton, and Hull, in 1875, aristocratic Leeds bank <italic>Beckett</italic>\u2014led by a nephew-in-law of the Churchill-Spencers\u2014purchased the failed <italic>Swann Clough</italic> of York, Driffield, Pocklington, Pickering, and Helmsley, in 1879. \nLikewise, Liverpool lost her legacy merchant bankers to London. Among the first was <italic>Huth</italic> in 1877, as <italic>Huth</italic>\u2019s<italic> </italic>Meinertzhagen kinterlinked with the Unitarian cotton broker <italic>Holt</italic> family which co-founded <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic>. By 1883, <italic>Bank of Liverpool</italic> fused with <italic>Heywood</italic>,<italic> </italic>Liverpool\u2019s oldest private bank. After <italic>Gibbs</italic> shuttered in 1881, <italic>Schr\u00f6der</italic> in 1884, although <italic>Schr\u00f6der </italic>incarnated through over twenty kinterlinks and partnerships in the first half of the 19th century, including a Liverpool branch that remained open until 1916. <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Kleinwort</italic> remained, but both invested into other commodities and markets as well.\nSince the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> led <italic>Horsfall</italic> and other Liverpool merchant bankers to sell off their assets by 1875, British West Africa\u2019s palm oil industry shifted to more capitalized and structured industry with consolidation into <italic>West African Co</italic>, <italic>British & Continental African Co</italic> (took over <italic>Co of African Merchants</italic>), <italic>Niger Co</italic> (1879), and <italic>Couper Johnstone</italic> (1879). \nAs palm prices fell from 1881, firms formed cartels and mergers to stabilize trade and limit competition. By 1889 the nine largest British West Africa\u2019s palm oil traders\u2014<italic>Harrison</italic>, <italic>British & Continental African Co</italic>, <italic>Couper Johnstone</italic>, <italic>Hatton Cookson</italic>, <italic>Helt Cotterell</italic>, <italic>King</italic>, <italic>Stuart</italic> <italic>Douglas</italic>, <italic>Taylor Laughland</italic>, and George Watts\u2014merged to form <italic>African Association </italic>in Liverpool to dominate the palm oil trade. After ruinous competition with other companies, <italic>African Association</italic> formed <italic>Niger Pool</italic> with <italic>Niger Co</italic>, <italic>Miller</italic>, and a smaller company. A Horsfall kinterlinked with Smyth in 1891.\nGold ventures were more successful. In 1873, drought followed by 1874 floods raised food and transport costs in southern Africa, and the global diamond price dropped due to an Austrian stock exchange slump. Concurrently, banks started foreclosing on indebted small diggers, while mines faced threats of collapsing walls and flooding from haphazard development and primitive technology. As Kimberley\u2019s open-cast operations extended underground, the mines required costly machinery and advanced techniques.\nThe Asante controlled Ghana\u2019s goldfields since the 17th century until British colonization after the <italic>Panic of 1873</italic> in 1874 attracted European commercial investment. From the 1880s, West African entrepreneurs sought to attract European capital to the Gold Coast through gold mining ventures. Some of these entrepreneurs were coastal African merchants who acted as intermediaries between upcountry chiefs and European company managers. \nMost aimed to profit by leasing mineral lands at low costs and selling the leases to Europeans at higher prices. While many mining ventures failed due to the lack of advanced technology, expertise, and capital among African entrepreneurs, some successful companies were established with African directors and managers. These ventures thrived by including British financiers on their boards and trading shares on the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>. \nSouth Africa also attracted more miners. Following the discovery of diamonds in South Africa in 1867, <italic>Mosenthal</italic> expanded into mining and other exploration companies established a firm foothold in Southern Africa with the creation of London-registered <italic>South African Goldfields Exploration </italic>with a concession to mine in the Transvaal by 1868. The company never paid dividends and had limited impact. Amidst the rush, emerged small-scale diggers, who sold to large and small dealers, both legally and illegally. While merchants of London and Amsterdam controlled the diamonds trade, <italic>Mosenthal</italic> and other dealers had branch offices in South Africa, buying directly from the miners. \nBy 1870, <italic>Mosenthal</italic> and fellow Kimberley pioneers formed <italic>London & South African Exploration</italic>. The company became a major landowner in the Griqualand West diamond-mining area, and achieved significant financial success, paying exceptionally high dividends. In 1871, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> led <italic>Schaaffhausen</italic>, <italic>Wiener</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> Vienna\u2019s <italic>Creditanstalt</italic>, <italic>Becker Fuld</italic>, <italic>Lippma</italic><italic>n</italic><italic>n Rosenthal</italic>, and <italic>Eltzbach</italic><italic>er</italic> in starting <italic>Amsterdam Bank</italic> under the management of <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic>. <italic>Amsterdam Bank</italic> created a diamond credit market for large and small entrepreneurs based in South Africa and Europe.\nSince Court Jew descendant <italic>Mosenthal</italic> of Hesse, Warburg cousins <italic>Lippert</italic> of Hamburg, and other Jews operated frontier stores in South Africa, they ventured into banking and gold and diamonds. By 1875, Goldschmidt and Hamburger cousin Alfred Beit arrived in Kimberley on behalf of <italic>Lippert </italic>of Hamburg. Other Jewish entrepreneurs included <italic>Barnato</italic>, <italic>Erlanger</italic>, and <italic>Dunkelsbuhler</italic>. <italic>Dunkelsbuhler</italic> represented <italic>Mosenthal</italic>, along with their brother-in-law, Bernhard Oppenheimer. Despite privileged backgrounds, they fled the limited opportunities in Bavaria as teenagers. They quickly grew their mining business and established <italic>Dunkelsbuhler</italic> as an independent broker in London in 1878. \nLike <italic>Wertheim Gomperz</italic>, Moritz Porges, a great-nephew of a Katz-descendant of Chief Rabbi of Moravia Gabriel Eskeles, moved to Vienna by 1822, where he became a jeweler. While Moritz\u2019s brother married a silk and cotton trader Pressburger-Todesco, his brother-in-law\u2019s sister married textile manufacturer Porges\u2019 extended ennobled cousin, and his daughter and niece wed Sampson Wertheim\u2019s descendants. \nBy 1855, Karoline\u2019s daughter wed banker Joseph Teixeira of Amsterdam, Consul General in Budapest. Another of Moritz Porges\u2019 Pressburger-Todesco nieces married Ignaz Levinsohn Ephrussi in 1856, who soon formed<italic> Ephrussi Porges</italic>. Moritz\u2019s son, Jules, later moved to Paris in the 1860s, where he sold jewelry. By 1871, Jules hired Julius Wernher, of an \u201cold and reputable\u201d Darmstadt Protestant family, to procure diamonds directly from South Africa. In 1876, <italic>Ephrussi Porges</italic>\u2019 Theodore Porges married a daughter of <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s in-law and Spanish agent Weisweiller. \nEarly Protestant British miners included a Baring cousin and Cecil Rhodes, the son of an Anglican clergyman. Actively financing Rhodes and the diamond and gold mining industries, <italic>Standard Bank</italic> took on central bank-like functions in South Africa. Already larger than all British South African banks by 1870, <italic>Standard </italic>acquired <italic>London & South African Bank</italic> in 1877. While <italic>Standard</italic> limited credit, miners incorporated to mine deeper amidst cost competition. \nBy 1880, Cecil Rhodes floated <italic>DeBeers</italic> with a \u00a3200,000 share capital and support from <italic>Rothschild</italic> London, after which <italic>DeBeers</italic> acquired <italic>French Co</italic>, <italic>Kimberley Central</italic>, and <italic>Barnato</italic> competitors with <italic>Lippert</italic> and Goldschmidt cousin Alfred Beit in to consolidate <italic>DeBeers</italic>. Amidst the South African mining \u2018share mania\u2019 that followed, <italic>Porges</italic>, represented by Paul Keil, promoted <italic>Anglo-African Co</italic>, floated in London in 1881 with a capital of \u00a3650,000. As the success of <italic>Mosenthal</italic>\u2019s exploration company served as a model for others, <italic>Jardine</italic> parlayed <italic>Rio Tinto</italic> copper mine profits into <italic>Transvaal Gold, Exploration, & Land</italic>. \nHowever, the timing was poor for one of the few Black Africans to start a bank was low born but married an elite. James Horton\u2019s father, a recaptured slave from Iboland, settled in a village outside Freetown after rescue by the British protective squadron. Certified as a physician with a missionary education in 1859, James served for twenty-years in the British Army\u2019s medical service, notably in the Gold Coast during the <italic>Asante War of 1873</italic>. \nHorton\u2019s efforts culminated in founding <italic>London & West African Bank</italic> in 1882. Headquartered in London with branches at Cape Coast, Lagos, and Freetown, the bank aimed to attract support from British banks, using Horton\u2019s wealth as collateral, and providing loans to enterprising Africans. However, Horton\u2019s passing in 1883 left the bank with little chance of success in the <italic>Panic of 1884</italic>. \nStarting in 1887, <italic>Johannesburg Stock Exchange</italic> became Africa\u2019s dominant exchange. Established to facilitate the trade of South African gold shares, the exchange included banks as active members, unlike global counterparts. That year, Rhodes brought Alfred Beit onto <italic>DeBeers</italic>\u2019 board alongside <italic>Rothschild</italic> investors.\nFollowing the <italic>Panic of </italic><italic>1889</italic> in South Africa, <italic>Standard Bank</italic>\u2019s Lewis Michell\u2014from Cornwall like the Vivians and related to the Hamblys and Duncombes \u2014and Cecil Rhodes drafted the local bank reform law. Michell had advised Rhodes along with Alfred Beit of <italic>Beit</italic>, who dominated  the South African diamond market along with <italic>Mosenthal</italic><italic> </italic>and<italic> Porges</italic>\u2019 Julius Wernher. \nIn 1889, they formed <italic>DeBeers</italic> to cartelize South African diamonds and gold. Along with promoting <italic>DeBeers</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London also sponsored <italic>Burma Ruby</italic>. By 1890, Bernhard Oppenheimer represented <italic>Dunkelsbuhler</italic> in signing the first diamond cartel agreement with <italic>DeBeers </italic>and eight firms. But new discoveries continued. Soon after, Michell became general manager of <italic>Standard Bank</italic>. \nMeanwhile, German colonial shipping grew. Back in 1847, <italic>Berenberg</italic> <italic>Gossler</italic>, <italic>Merck</italic>, and other Hamburg merchants founded <italic>Hamburg-American Shipping</italic>. <italic>Berenberg</italic> <italic>Gossler</italic>, <italic>Merck</italic>, <italic>Heine</italic>, and other merchants founded <italic>Norddeutsche Bank</italic> in 1856. \nIn 1863, Johann Gossler\u2019s niece married Ferdinand Hertz. Hertz\u2019s father Adolph was born in Hamburg, the son of banker Jacob Hertz and Fanny Bacher, a second great-granddaughter of Samuel Oppenheim and niece of Moses Mendelssohn through his wife, Frumet Guggenheim. Adolph converted to Lutheranism in 1822 and married that year. After training, he began trade with Scandinavia in 1826. He acquired ships from 1837 and expanded trade to China, East India, Africa, and Arabia by 1844. Hertz ended the African and general trade in 1859 and invested in shipping and a shipyard. The company became Hamburg\u2019s largest sailing ship firm and third-largest overall.\nBy 1885,<italic> Berenberg Gossler</italic> and <italic>Beit </italic>invested in<italic> </italic>Adolph Woermann\u2019s <italic>German-African Shipping</italic>. Woermann\u2019s father Carl exported linen to Central and South America, Australia, and Southeast Asia. The firm opened branches in Monrovia in 1854, Gabon in 1862, and Cameroon in 1868. In 1885, Adolph separated the shipping arm as with capital.\nAlthough German firms initially struggled to compete with established Duala traders, colonial authority later tilted the balance in their favor. By the mid-19th century, Duala commerce had shifted toward Bell control. The Akwa and other Duala lineages retained independent authority, but the Bells, as Senior Chiefs of the left-bank Bonambela settlements, managed trade along the Wouri and Mungo rivers, collected palm oil and ivory from inland producers, controlled canoe transport, and extended credit. Falling palm oil prices after the 1860s pushed the Bells to centralize trade upriver, establishing posts at Bakundu and Mombo Beach by the early 1880s.\nIn the 1880s, German firms such as <italic>Jantzen Thorm\u00e4hlen</italic> sought to compete on the Mungo, while <italic>Woermann</italic> gained a monopoly over trade to Edea on the Sanaga after sponsoring an expedition in 1890. <italic>Jantzen Thorm\u00e4hlen</italic>\u2019s Mungo venture collapsed in 1892 after the Bakoko campaign, which <italic>Woermann</italic> backed militarily. In 1895, German authorities expelled Duala traders from the Sanaga on allegations of arming the Bakoko, thereby undermining Akwa interests and consolidating the Bell as the primary local intermediaries.  \nAs Britain established Zanzibar as a protectorate, adjacent to German East Africa, and Rhodes readied to industrialize Africa and mine gold in 1890, Leo made his interest known to Minister to Belgium Hussey Vivian. Tippu Tip, who had been appointed Governor of the Stanley Falls District of the Congo Free State by King Leo in 1887, returned to Zanzibar in 1891. \nWhile Tippu\u2019s nephew succeeded him as governor of Stanley Falls, his son ruled Kasongo on the left side of the Congo River. Rising conflicts with European powers over ivory trade intensified into a 19-month campaign led by the Belgian Free State against Tippu\u2019s forces. The conflict, marked by significant casualties, led to the eventual destruction of Tippu\u2019s holdings in the Congo by Belgian forces.\nSince <italic>British East Africa Co</italic> formed in 1888, Arab uprisings against German colonization resulted in military suppression in 1889. While British public opinion after German action animated the Britain Government to take control of East Africa, buying out <italic>British East Africa Co</italic> and making German claims into protectorates between 1893 and 1895. As British East Africa incorporated Mombasa, it remained part of the Sultanate of Zanzibar within the Kenya Protectorate. \nWhile <italic>British East Africa Corp</italic> employed European planters from Ceylon and the Malay States to manage estates for Hugh Barclay and other absentee owners, <italic>National Bank of India</italic> served as government banker for British East Africa and Uganda. Founded in 1863, <italic>National Bank of India</italic> branched to Zanzibar in 1893, Nairobi in 1904, and Entebbe in 1906, and Kampala afterward. <italic>National Bank of India</italic> Nairobi employed four Europeans and twelve Indians around 1908 and corresponded with <italic>National Provincial</italic>, <italic>National Bank of Scotland</italic>, <italic>British Linen Co</italic>, and <italic>Provincial Bank of Ireland</italic> to handle drafts and remittances for the bank. \n<italic>Chartered Bank</italic> also entered Zanzibar and both banks were linked to the Smyth and Scottish cousinhood. Montague Turner, a partner at <italic>Mackinnon Mackenzie</italic>, served as Chair of <italic>Chartered Bank</italic>. <italic>Indian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>\u2019s board included <italic>Hoare Miller</italic>, and <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> partners. Since the late 1870s, <italic>Jardine</italic> Calcutta and <italic>Jardine</italic> Hong Kong added directors to <italic>Chartered</italic>. London and Manchester merchant Emile Levita was one of the few Jews to crack this clique and become a <italic>Chartered </italic>director in 1872. A grandson of the former Chief Rabbi of Westphalia and a Hanover banker, Levita immigrated to Britain in the 1850s and wed a Manchester-born Danish R\u00e9e cousin of the Oppenheim and Warburg families. \nWhile Herbert Smyth represented the family at <italic>Jardine</italic>,<italic> </italic>William Mackenzie joined <italic>Smyth</italic> cousins, London stockbroker <italic>Zoete</italic> in 1896. With Smyth kinterlinked with West African palm oil trader <italic>Horsfall</italic> in 1891, <italic>Smyth</italic> was long connected to <italic>Barclay Bevan</italic>. Around 1900, a Smyth heiress married a cousin of the Finlay, Campbell, Coutts, and Bevan.<italic> </italic>While <italic>Finlay</italic> merged with <italic>Baring</italic> in the 1860s, the Campbells kinterlinked with the Finlays, founded <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> Bombay, and served on <italic>Indian</italic> <italic>National Bank</italic>\u2019s board. \nSince Colin Middleton Campbell kinterlinked with Bevan in 1873\u2014and their son was BOE\u2019s Deputy Governor from 1905 and Governor from 1907. His cousin Colin Hogg Campbell\u2014whose mother was the daughter of Guyana<italic> </italic>tea merchant <italic>Hogg</italic>\u2014married a daughter of <italic>Coutts</italic>\u2019 Senior Partner in 1890. After his father died in 1897, Colin succeeded him as Governor of <italic>London Assurance</italic>. He succeeded John Muir as Chair of <italic>Finlay Campbell</italic> following his death in 1903, and merged with Charles Perkins Forbes\u2019 firm. Joining <italic>National Provincial</italic>\u2019s board.\nLikewise, the connection of Belgian and British forces impacted the Zande kingdoms along the Nile. From 1890, Sultan S\u00e9mio collaborated with Belgian expeditions. Likewise, that year, the fellow Zande chief Jabir in Eastern Congo formed temporary arrangement with Belgian-aligned Tippu Tip to facilitate Tippu\u2019s ivory expeditions and secure safe passage in Zande-controlled areas, without lasting political or military integration. S\u00e9mio exercised authority through his sons, sustaining control over commerce, marriages, and political alliances; upon his death in 1912, his sons inherited a sultanate with integrated military, trade, and administrative networks.\nHowever, Britain\u2019s desire to create a continuous British-controlled corridor from Cape Colony to Cairo conflicted with Portugal\u2019s ambition to link her colonies in Angola and Mozambique. Unlike the economics that drove new European imperialists, the prestige of her past drove Portugal as trade remained insignificant. \nWhen Britain issued an ultimatum demanding her withdrawal from Southeast Africa in 1890, Portugal complied unable to resist. While Portugal revoked <italic>National Overseas Bank</italic>\u2019s banking monopoly in Mozambique in 1891 and in Portuguese India two years later to allow British banks to enter Mozambique and Portuguese India, <italic>National Overseas </italic>still had a banknote monopoly. Similarly, <italic>National </italic><italic>Overseas</italic>\u2019 monopoly in western Africa continued through 1901, but few Portuguese banks could compete. \nIn 1893, Rhodes contracted to sell <italic>DeBeers</italic>\u2019 entire output through a London <italic>Diamond Syndicate</italic> of ten kinterlinked Jewish firms: <italic>Wernher Beit</italic>, <italic>Barnato</italic>, <italic>Mosenthal</italic>, <italic>Dunkelsbuhler</italic>, <italic>Joseph</italic>, <italic>Cohen</italic>, <italic>Lilienfeld</italic>, <italic>Gervers</italic>, <italic>Neumann</italic>, and <italic>Feldheimer</italic>. Likewise, the organizer of the syndicate, Solomon Barnato Joel, joined the boards of <italic>DeBeers</italic><italic> </italic>and <italic>Standard Bank</italic>. Rhodes also approached converted Belmont cousin Emile Erlanger in 1892 to consolidate South Africa\u2019s diamond industry. \nInvesting in Rhodesian railways, South Africa electricity, and Mozambique ports, Erlanger wed a French noble by 1895, and naturalized as a British citizen in 1901. Also in 1892, Alfred Beit\u2019s cousin, Eduard married Gustav Speyer\u2019s daughter, adding her surname to his. After his father-in-law Gustav died in 1902, Eduard Beit Speyer converted to Protestantism and became head of <italic>Speyer</italic> Frankfurt. \nFrom 1896, <italic>Beit</italic> Co-Head Julius Wernher also was a <italic>Smyth</italic> director as Smyth cousins directed and governed BOE, West Australia, and other institutions. Likewise, Lancelot Smyth became the third partner the recently established stockbroking firm of <italic>Rowe Pitman</italic>, which invested heavily in gold. By 1899, a Smyth cousin married Gifford\u2019s second cousin. And <italic>Smyth</italic> cousin<italic> </italic><italic>Zoete</italic>, London stockbrokers, recruited William Mackenzie of Far East trader Mackinnon Mackenzie in 1896.\nSince 1891, <italic>Elder Dempster Shipping</italic> became Managing Agent for <italic>African Steamship Co </italic>(\u201cASC\u201d), where Alfred Jones acquired a 75% share. Born in Wales to a former owner of <italic>The Welshman</italic> newspaper and a reverend\u2019s daughter, Jones moved with his family to Liverpool, where he attended local schools and, in 1859, became a cabin boy with ASC. \nIn 1863, Jones started as a junior clerk at ASC\u2019s agent,<italic> Laird</italic> <italic>Fletcher</italic>, later becoming the manager. After losing ASC in 1878, Jones established his own shipping and insurance brokerage. As he chartered a steamship to West Africa in 1879, <italic>Elder Dempster Shipping</italic> invited him to join <italic>British &</italic> <italic>African Shipping</italic> to avoid competition. By 1884, Jones bought out control of <italic>Elder Dempster Shipping</italic>.\nSince co-funding <italic>Dutch South African </italic>RR with <italic>Warschauer</italic> in 1887, <italic>Berliner </italic>soon became German southwest Africa\u2019s main export-trade bank, particularly for diamonds. After negotiating an agreement with Adolph Woermann\u2019s <italic>German-African Shipping</italic> in 1890, British <italic>Elder Dempster Shipping</italic> became managing agents for ASC, where Jones acquired a 75% share.<italic> </italic><italic>Elder</italic>\u2019s Alfred Jones formed <italic>West Africa Shipping Conference</italic> in 1895 and diversified into various sectors.\nWithout banks, Colonial officials had depended on <italic>Elder Dempster Shipping</italic> for importing silver coins from the Mint. Since <italic>Dutch</italic> <italic>Bank for South Africa</italic> formed in 1888 in the Boer Republic, the older Dutch <italic>Cape of Good Hope Bank</italic> failed by 1890, and <italic>Lloyds</italic>, <italic>National Provincial</italic>, and <italic>Westminster </italic>banks formed <italic>African Banking Corp</italic> to import silver and compete with <italic>Standard Bank</italic> in southern Africa. \nAlong with absorbing <italic>Cape of Good Hope Bank, Western Province Bank</italic>, <italic>Kaffrarian Colonial Bank</italic>, and <italic>Worcester Commercial Bank</italic> by 1892, <italic>African Banking Corp</italic> spread to Nigeria and became first British bank in West Africa. As <italic>Kaffrarian Colonial Bank</italic> opened a New York branch, <italic>Standard Bank</italic> opened branches across South Africa and Southern Rhodesia by 1892. \nSince <italic>African Banking Corp</italic> became the first British bank in West Africa, <italic>Elder Dempster Shipping</italic>\u2019s Jones incorporated <italic>Bank of British West Africa </italic>(\u201cBBWA\u201d) in 1894. Under Jones, BBWA\u2019s inaugural directors were F.W. Bond, Chair of <italic>African Steamship Shipping</italic>; Henry Coke, Liverpool agent for <italic>Sassoon</italic>; and Edward Lawrence, a Liverpool merchant. BBWA bought <italic>African Banking</italic> <italic>Corp</italic> Nigeria, and branched to grow her silver coin import monopoly with branches in Ghana, Sierra Leone, and New York. By 1895, Jones formed <italic>West Africa Shipping Conference</italic>. \nHowever, as <italic>Niger Co</italic> lost her administrative rights and Chair George Goldie resigned after the death of his wife,<italic> Niger Co</italic> established<italic> Anglo-African Bank</italic> in 1899, breaking<italic> </italic>BBWA\u2019s monopoly. As <italic>Anglo-African Bank</italic> was renamed <italic>Bank of Nigeria</italic>, she fiercely competed with BBWA.\nBritain attempted to block French expansion in the Sudan by encouraging Italy to invade Abyssinia in 1895. However, the plan failed when the Italian army was soon defeated. In 1899, Britain, France, and Germany began partitioning West African Hausaland. \nAfter Britain established the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria in 1900, troops peacefully entered Sokoto in 1904, integrating it Nigeria. Despite colonial rule, the Islamic dynasty of sultans in Sokoto persisted, as the British policy of indirect rule maintained their authority for decades. While John Bergheim of Galician oiler <italic>Bergheim MacGarvey</italic> gained a near-monopoly on Southern Nigeria petroleum exploration, his search failed.\nWith growing African mining speculation,<italic> Rothschild</italic> led <italic>Hirsch</italic>, <italic>Deutsche</italic>, <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, <italic>Beit</italic>, and others to control mining. Likewise, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC launched <italic>Rand Mines</italic>, <italic>Geldenhuis</italic>, <italic>Mashonaland Goldfields</italic>, <italic>Consolidated</italic>, <italic>Jumpers</italic>, and <italic>Transvaal & General Association</italic>. To stabilize the market, <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise de L\u2019Afrique du Sud</italic>, started in early 1895 to promote deep-level Transvaal mining with<italic> </italic>President Jacques Siegfried, VP Ernest May, and Jacques Gunzburg.\nSince refusing stabilizing monopolization ventures for copper, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London parlayed <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC funds to buy <italic>Jardine</italic>\u2019s <italic>Rio Tinto</italic><italic> </italic>and<italic> </italic>join <italic>Bleichr\u00f6der</italic>, Cassel, <italic>Lewisohn</italic>, <italic>Brandeis Goldschmidt</italic>, and others to cartelize global copper into <italic>COPPER </italic>using <italic>Guggenheimer Untermyer</italic> as counsel. \nMoreover, <italic>Rothschild</italic> London diversified <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC since the failure of <italic>Baring </italic>in 1890 into mines across Australia, Mexico, and Alaska, and with the safer London PUs in 1895. Since <italic>Exploration </italic>IHC became a joint stock in 1889 faced a backlash against founders\u2019 shares, which entitled founders to a disproportionate share of profits. This led to the abolition of founders\u2019 shares, although the founders were compensated with half the company\u2019s capital at par. While <italic>Smyth</italic>\u2019s Gerard Smyth became a director in 1895, <italic>Kuhn</italic>\u2019s Speyer cousin Schiff\u2019s sister wed in 1898 a fellow Katz-cousin Warburg, a cousin of Goldschmidt and Oppenheim<italic>.</italic>\nBut as diplomatic tension between Germany and Britain about Africa grew, the dominant German African <italic>Berliner </italic>lost interest in colonies. By then, European missionaries, merchants, and consular officials documented massacres and atrocities against the Congolese. Affiliated with Britain\u2019s crown prince, the Countess of Warwick asked Rhodes for a concession in 1895. Gaining an area north of the Zambezi River, her <italic>Warwick </italic>broker set out to organize financing. \nSince Britain colonized Ashanti Ghana in 1874, Ashanti chiefs continued to rule as they had for a millennium. By 1890, several educated, middle-class Black Africans, JP Brown, Alfred Biney, and JE Ellis negotiated mining concessions with the Ashanti Kings of Bekwai and Adansi. They soon registered <italic>African Concessions Trust</italic> (1890) and <italic>Ashanti Exploration Co</italic> (1891) on the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>. However, capital and equipment challenges prompted them to send a high-grade ore sample in 1895 to Edwin Cade, a Christian in London. After a favorable assay by <italic>Johnson</italic>, Cade bought the goldfields lease from Brown, Ellis, and Biney. \nAs Britain surprised the Ashanti with an expeditionary force in 1896, the kings were exiled. Within a year, Cade listed <italic>Ashanti Goldfields</italic> on the <italic>London Stock Exchange</italic>. Resisting British rule, nationalists protested for the return of the king in 1900 while Queen Mother Yaa Asantewaa led fierce resistance for a year before she was captured and Britain annexed Ashanti for direct rule in 1901. Gold prices soared with the simultaneous <italic>Anglo-Boer War</italic> over South Africa between 1899 and 1902. While <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Afrique du Sud </italic>President Jacques Siegfried promoted deep-level Transvaal mining shares until his resignation in early 1899 due to his pro-Boer views. Ernest May, the bank\u2019s VP, and Jacques Gunzburg took over management.\nWhile May\u2019s cousin-in-laws married had kinterlinked with a Goldschmidt May Rosenthal of <italic>Lippman</italic><italic>n</italic><italic> Rosenthal</italic> and Becker Fuld by 1886 and Goldschmidts of <italic>Lippert</italic> by 1897, his daughters married a Worms in 1903 and a Lazard\u2014related to the Goldschmidts and, through the Foulds, to the Gunzburgs\u2014by 1905. In between, <italic>Banque Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Afrique du Sud </italic>and <italic>Banque Internationale de Paris</italic> merged to form <italic>Banque Commerce et l\u2019Industrie</italic> in 1901, with backing from <italic>Gunzburg</italic>, <italic>Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale</italic>, <italic>Paribas</italic>, and <italic>Comptoir</italic>, and former Finance Minister Maurice Rouvier as President. \nRouvier initially led the bank but left for government service in 1902, become Finance Minister in 1905, and returning in 1906. During his absence, May and other bank representatives shifted the focus to Franco-German economic cooperation and international bonds. With <italic>Beit</italic>, <italic>Rothschild</italic>, <italic>Lippert</italic>, <italic>Mosenthal</italic>, <italic>Oppenheimer</italic>, <italic>Barnato</italic>, and others German-speak Jewish gold trade financiers industrializing South Africa for decades, antisemites branded the war a \u2018Jewish war\u2019, even though Beit and others converted.\nIn French Africa, <italic>Marseillaise de Cr\u00e9dit </italic>and <italic>Transatlantique Bank</italic> started <italic>Works of Marseille </italic>PUHC in 1891. Originally for sanitation,<italic> Works of Marseille</italic> built power plants from 1898 and created <italic>Mediterranean Coast</italic><italic> Electric</italic>, becoming France\u2019s leading public works company by 1908. By then After the <italic>Treaty of Frankfurt</italic> of 1871 annexed part of Lorraine to Germany, Alphonse Fould married Auguste Dupont\u2019s granddaughter and took an increasing role in his father-in-law\u2019s <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic>, becoming <italic>Dupont Fould</italic>. \nAfter his father-in-law died in 1884, Fould bought out the family and became the sole manager. In 1888, Katz-descendant Suzanne Gunzburg Fould married Sephardi shipping heir of Bordeaux Raoul Gradis,<italic> </italic>Simon Lazard\u2019s daughter wed Ren\u00e9 Dupont Fould\u2014a Katz, Speyer, Halphen, and Deutsch-Meurthe descendant\u2014after his iron magnate father Alphonse Fould<italic> </italic>took <italic>Dupont Fould</italic> public in 1898. Ren\u00e9\u2019s uncle, Salomon Halfon, Eug\u00e8ne Pereire\u2019s son-in-law, secured Ren\u00e9 boards seats at <italic>Penho\u00ebt</italic> shipyard and <italic>Transatlantique Shipping</italic>. While Raymond Lazard married a daughter of <italic>Transatlantique</italic>\u2019s Jacque Lumbroso in 1903, Jacques Pereire married Fould cousin and <italic>Dupont Dreyfus</italic> heiress<italic> </italic>Ad\u00e8le Halphen Dupont the following year.\nWith investments ranging from oil works and cotton ginning in Dahomey and Togo, CFAO and other Marseille and Bordeaux merchants and shipowners, reorganized <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic> into <italic>Bank of French West Africa</italic> (\u201cBFWA\u201d) in 1901, with the right to issue currency across French West Africa, expanding into Equatorial Africa, Togo, and Cameroon. The capital was allocated with 60% for Bordeaux, 20% for <italic>Comptoir</italic>, and 20% for Marseille stakeholders, including CFAO. \nCFAO directors included <italic>Bank of Senegal</italic>\u2019s Henri Nouvion, <italic>Comptoir</italic>\u2019s Emile Mercet, Fould and Lazard in-law Gaston Gradis, <italic>Fabre Fraissinet</italic>\u2019s Paul Cyprien-Fabre and Marc Fraissinet, and Greek <italic>Zarifi</italic> Marseille<italic>.</italic>  As <italic>French</italic> <italic>Colonial Cotton Association</italic>\u2019s ventures were merged into <italic>French Colonial Cotton Co</italic>, active in Dahomey, Madagascar, and New Caledonia in 1905,<italic> French Co for Colonial Studies & Enterprises</italic> specialized in industrial and financial affairs in French colonies.   \nFrench trading companies in Africa also transitioned from facilitating trade to contributing to local development and training. Hussam Okoya Thomas, CFAO\u2019s first Nigerian staff member, worked there from 1902 for 52 years and was the first Baba Adinni of Furabay Mosque, Olowogbowo, Lagos. His wife, Alhaja Suwebat Okoya Thomas, was the Otun Iya Adinni of Idita Mosque. By 1912, CFAO\u2019s Lagos office employed twelve literate Africans in clerical positions, and by 1930, the Port-Harcourt office had twenty-one.\nBack in 1899, <italic>DeBeers</italic> bought the diamond merchant <italic>London & South African Exploration </italic>from <italic>Mosenthal</italic>. Since <italic>Standard Bank</italic> made Smyth-in-law Charles Fremantle her chair in 1898, who also became a director of <italic>Bank of Australasia</italic>. From 1901, <italic>Standard </italic>branched internationally, starting with Nyasaland. Having banking Cecil Rhodes and served as general manager of <italic>Standard Bank</italic> since the 1890s, Cornwall-born Lewis Michell he retired from banking, became Chair of <italic>DeBeers</italic>, and joined the board of <italic>British South Africa Co</italic>.\nBack in 1884, the semireligious Scottish <italic>African Lakes Corp</italic> set up a trading post at Karonga on Lake Nyasa. The station traded primarily in ivory and attracted Swahili Arab traders like Mlozi, Msalema, and Kopakopa. Initially, these traders cooperated with <italic>African Lakes Corp</italic> and the local Nkonde people, but they soon fortified their settlements and aligned with the Henga tribe to dominate the region and expand the slave trade. \nBy 1887, tensions erupted when Mlozi\u2019s men murdered a Nkonde sub-chief. Further violence followed in October, when an Nkonde chief was killed, triggering open conflict. Within days, Mlozi\u2019s forces massacred Nkonde refugees at Kambwe Lagoon by setting fire to the reeds and firing on those trying to escape. Mlozi, who had consolidated power by marrying Kisutu\u2019s daughter, maintained dominance but faced growing British pressure.\nIn 1889, British Commissioner Harry Johnston secured a treaty with Jumbe Kisutu, guaranteeing British protection in exchange for annual payments funded by <italic>British South Africa Co</italic>. Despite initial cooperation, Johnston increasingly viewed the Arab presence as a threat. By 1895, Johnston decided to eliminate Arab resistance. By yearend, he attacked Mlozi\u2019s fortified position at Karonga. After intense fighting, Mlozi was captured, tried, and executed. This defeat, funded and supported by <italic>British South Africa</italic>, ended Arab control and solidified British rule, leading to the establishment of British Central Africa and Nyasaland.\nSince 1894, <italic>British South Africa </italic>granted a license for entrepreneurs to supply electricity and water to Bulawayo, Rhodesia, in the hope of mineral wealth. From that year, Earl Albert Grey replaced Cecil Rhodes as the Administrator of Southern Rhodesia until becoming director of <italic>British South Africa </italic>in 1898 and urging development. \nAs Britain and Germany agreed to partition Portuguese colonies for development, Rhodes extended <italic>Warwick</italic>\u2019s concession from Cape Town to Cairo. But as the contract had unprofitable geographic profit restrictions,<italic> Warwick</italic> failed to find financing. As Cassel\u2019s <italic>Hirsch</italic> took over the railroad contract in 1899 with <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s Belgian agent, <italic>Lambert</italic>, they formed <italic>Tanganyika Concessions</italic> with support Rhodes. \nDespite this small participation, King Leo\u2019s Free State created <italic>Comit\u00e9</italic> with broad administrative powers in 1900 with investors including <italic>Lambert</italic> and William Mackinnon. By 1899, <italic>Rothschild</italic>\u2019s <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC and <italic>Disconto</italic> founded <italic>Otavi</italic> RR in Berlin, acquiring 1,000 square miles in German Southwest Africa, including the Otavi, Little Otavi, Anwap, and Tsumeb copper mines.  \nAs the <italic>Baring</italic> failure led <italic>Morton </italic>London to dissolve in 1899, <italic>Morgan</italic>\u2019s trainee Arthur Grenfell partnered with his extended cousin Ernest Chapin to form <italic>Chapin</italic> <italic>Grenfell</italic>, while <italic>Morgan</italic> promoted his cousin Walter Spencer Morgan Burns to partner and hired Arthur\u2019s cousin Edward Grenfell as his London agent.\nIn 1901, Arthur Grenfell married Earl Grey\u2019s daughter and joined the boards of <italic>Metallgesellschaft</italic> and several African mining ventures. (Likewise, three Grey and Baring cousins wed Grenfells, diversifying their <italic>Baring</italic> and <italic>Glyn </italic>connections.) As Rhodes died in 1902, Earl Grey formed <italic>Charter</italic> to conduct trust business for <italic>South Africa Co</italic>, and his son-in-law Grenfell joined <italic>Charter</italic>\u2019s board and raised a loan for Rhodesia. \nIn German Namibia, since <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC <italic>Disconto</italic> founded <italic>Otavi</italic> RR in 1899, <italic>German Colonial Co</italic> land rights, where diamond discoveries destabilized <italic>DeBeers</italic>\u2019 cartel, leading to another syndicate in 1903, this time eight firms, adding <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter </italic>and <italic>Rothschild</italic> London\u2019s <italic>Exploration</italic> IHC, which invested in related copper ventures. \nWhile German Colonial Governor of Namibia Theodor Leutwein persuaded Herero Chief Samuel Maharero to give up the land for the railway, could not secure further concessions. As the German administration displaced the Herero, Maharero revolted, seizing livestock and killing over 100 Germans. In response, German forces defeated the Herero in August. While the Herero retreated, German blockades and harsh conditions caused widespread dehydration and starvation. While Germany negotiated peace by urging the Herero to move to camps, these camps were poorly provisioned, leading to many deaths.\nBy 1906, Chancellor Bernhard B\u00fclow appointed Bernhard Dernburg Director of the German Colonial Department. Dernburg\u2019s Jewish grandfather converted to Christianity after facing antisemitism, married a Reinach, and served as a Privy Counsellor. Dernburg\u2019s Christian mother was a Huth, of unknown relation to the British <italic>Huth</italic>, but related to the Frankfurt Metzlers. After training in banking at <italic>Berliner</italic>, Bernhard worked in New York for <italic>Ladenburg Thalmann</italic>. \nReturning to Germany in 1888, he joined <italic>Deutsche Bank</italic>, where he restructured <italic>Pomeranian Mortgage Bank</italic>, and became a director at <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic> in 1901. Dernburg reformed Germany\u2019s brutal colonial administration by focusing on economic development and efficiency, promoting infrastructure development, such as building railways and improving agricultural practices, to make the colonies more economically viable. Dernburg emphasized that such progress was essential for self-rule could be considered. But as colonial exports grew, conservative elements forced Dernburg out. \nAfter<italic> Berliner </italic>established <italic>Deutsche Colonial </italic>RR<italic> & Port</italic> <italic>Construction</italic> in 1904,<italic> </italic>Germany ended <italic>German Colonial Co</italic>\u2019s exclusive rights in Namibia in 1905. As <italic>Berliner </italic>built <italic>L\u00fcderitzbucht-Kubub</italic> RR in Namibia and operated <italic>Usambara</italic> RR in German East Africa. While GGE\u2019s Emil Rathenau founded <italic>German Southwest African Mining Syndicate</italic> and an irrigation company in 1907, <italic>Berliner </italic>co-founded <italic>German Diamond </italic>by 1911. Rathenau\u2019s financier Jacob Lando had kinterlinked with Ludwig Asser Kaufmann, a baptized second great grandson of Daniel Itzig-Jaffe, nephew-in-law of <italic>Oppenheim </italic>Cologne, and nephew-in-law of Cologne-born Robert Esser, who chaired <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>and <italic>Rheinisch-Westf\u00e4lische Bodenkreditbank</italic>, and served on the boards of thirteen others, including <italic>Dresdner</italic> and <italic>South Cameroon</italic>.\nBy 1905, <italic>Bank of Egypt</italic> received a concession to establish <italic>Bank of Abyssinia</italic>. While the founding committee included three Brits, three Italians, and a German, the bank primarily had British interests and personnel, despite efforts to internationalize the venture. The same year, <italic>Bank of German East Africa</italic>, with branches in Zanzibar, Mombasa, and Dar-es-Salaam. Driving out the British <italic>National Bank </italic><italic>of India </italic>and <italic>Chartered Bank</italic>, she served as both an ordinary and central note bank for German East Africa, facilitating payments and remittances, and was authorized to issue bank notes in <italic>rupees</italic>. \nForestalling the growth of <italic>Bank of British West Africa</italic>, <italic>Bank of German West Africa</italic> started that year, operating as colonial central banks in Togo and Cameroon but without a note issuance privilege. Major German banks such as <italic>Berliner</italic>, <italic>Darmst\u00e4dter</italic>, <italic>Disconto</italic>, <italic>Nationalbank</italic>, <italic>Norddeutsche</italic>, and <italic>Schaaffhausen </italic>funded the colonization, including the construction of <italic>Cameroon</italic> RR to link Duala to the Manenguba Mountains in 1906. However, as <italic>Cameroon</italic> RR and improved seaports in 1912, the Akwa chiefs of the Duala coast and Senior Chief Rudolf Bell protested the seizure of property, relocation of residents, and weakened economic role. \nIn 1914, <italic>German-East African Shipping</italic> added stops at Lobito and Mossamedes, while German financiers studied Angola\u2019s harbors and rail links to South West Africa and Namibian mines. With British permission, <italic>Deutsche</italic> repurchased the Nyasaland concession. Likewise, Lobito concession owner Scotsman Robert Williams sought a Katangese copper monopoly, consulted Grey, and went to the German ambassador. Likewise, Germany became Liberia\u2019s primary trade partner, with <italic>Deutsche-Liberia Bank </italic>and<italic> Bank of British West Africa</italic> as the country\u2019s two banks.\nBut the outbreak of WWI soon halted Anglo-German cooperation.",
